TI  == evaluation of the effect of mpl and delivery route on immunogenicity and protectivity of different formulations of fimh and mrph from uropathogenic escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis in a uti mouse model.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) caused by escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis  are an important cause of morbidity and with the high rate of relapse and spread  of multi-drug resistant pathogens, pose a significant public health challenge worldwide. lack of an efficacious commercial vaccine targeting both uropathogens  makes development of a combined vaccine highly desirable. in this study the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of different formulations of fimh of upec, mrph of p. mirabilis and their fusion protein (mrph.fimh) subcutaneously administered with and without monophosphoryl lipid a (mpl) adjuvant were evaluated. our data showed that the subcutaneously administered proteins induced  both serum and mucosal igg, which mpl significantly improved developing a mixed th1 and th2 immune response. however, the preparations induced a higher systemic  and mucosal igg and il-2 levels by this route compared to the intranasal. immunization of mice with mrph.fimh fusion with mpl or a mixture of fimh, mrph and mpl conferred the highest protection of the bladder and kidneys when challenged with upec and p. mirabilis in a uti mouse model. therefore considering these results mrph.fimh fusion with mpl administered subcutaneously or intranasally could be a promising vaccine candidate for elimination of utis caused by upec and p. mirabilis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of portuguese foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the  centre and south of portugal. composition of essential oils was established by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (gc-fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis. the obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. a total of 16 compounds were identified. the main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). the percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: aspergillus niger, a. japonicus, a. oryzae, fusarium oxysporum, rhizophus oryzae and r. stolonifer. antibacterial  activity was assessed against three gram-positive strains: enterococcus faecalis  atcc 29212, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228 and s. aureus atcc 28213; and against six gram-negative strains: escherichia coli atcc 25922; morganella morganii lfg 08; proteus mirabilis lfg 04; salmonella enteritidis lfg 05; s. entiritidis serovar typhimurium lfg 06 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. the mic values varied from 62.5 (e. coli atcc 25922) to 2000 microml (p. aeruginosa atcc 27853).

TI  == characterization of a highly ph stable chi-class glutathione s-transferase from synechocystis pcc 6803.
AB  == glutathione s-transferases (gsts) are multifunctional enzymes present in virtually all organisms. besides having an essential role in cellular detoxification, they also perform various other functions, including responses in stress conditions and signaling. gsts are highly studied in plants and animals; however, the knowledge regarding gsts in cyanobacteria seems rudimentary. in this study, we report the characterization of a highly ph stable gst from the model cyanobacterium- synechocystis pcc 6803. the gene sll0067 was expressed in escherichia coli (e. coli), and the protein was purified to homogeneity. the expressed protein exists as a homo-dimer, which is composed of about 20 kda subunit. the results of the steady-state enzyme kinetics displayed protein's glutathione conjugation activity towards its class specific substrate- isothiocyanate, having the maximal activity with phenethyl isothiocyanate. contrary to the poor catalytic activity and low specificity towards standard gst  substrates such as 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene by bacterial gsts, pmgst b1-1 from proteus mirabilis, and e. coli gst, sll0067 has broad substrate degradation capability like most of the mammalian gst. moreover, we have shown that cyanobacterial gst sll0067 is catalytically efficient compared to the best mammalian enzymes. the structural stability of gst was studied as a function of ph. the fluorescence and cd spectroscopy in combination with size exclusion chromatography showed a highly stable nature of the protein over a broad ph range from 2.0 to 11.0. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first gst with such a wide range of ph related structural stability. furthermore, the presence of conserved proline-53, structural motifs such as n-capping box and hydrophobic staple further aid in the stability and proper folding of cyanobacterial gst- sll0067.

TI  == susceptibility trends and molecular characterization of gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections in jordan and lebanon: smart 2011-2013.
AB  == objectives: to investigate phenotypic and genotypic patterns of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract infection (uti) and intra-abdominal infection (iai) in medical centres of jordan and lebanon. methods: gram-negative bacilli from the smart study, collected between the years 2011 and 2013, were first identified at local laboratories. these isolates were shipped to a central laboratory where re-identification, susceptibility testing, and molecular characterization were performed using standard methods. results: among the 523 uti-associated isolates, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis were the most frequent (70%, 14%, and 5%, respectively). e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequent species among the 527 iai-associated isolates (46%, 14%, and 12%, respectively). incidence rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers among uti-associated e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis were 43%, 54%, and 4%, respectively. corresponding rates among iai-associated isolates were 49%, 56%, and 12%, respectively. acinetobacter baumannii and p. aeruginosa isolates showed very disturbing low susceptibility patterns. ctx-m-15  was the most prevalent esbl produced. seventeen isolates were non-susceptible to  carbapenems (estimated prevalence of 1.6%). conclusions: the alarmingly high rates of esbl production and emergence of carbapenemases emphasize the urgent need to develop antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and to maintain antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems.

TI  == carriage rates and characteristics of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in healthy individuals: comparison of applicants for long-term care and individuals screened for employment purposes.
AB  == aims: we compared the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers in the faecal samples of 1,109 healthy individuals screened for employment purposes and in 531 asymptomatic individuals applying for long-term care (ltc). methods: eosin-methylene blue agar plates supplemented with 2 mg/l cefotaxime were used to determine which individuals were esbl producers. esbl phenotype was confirmed by double-disk synergy test and esbl genes were identified by sequencing. esbl producers were characterized by co-resistance and  integron carriage. results: esbl producers were more frequent in the ltc applicants than in the employment screening individuals (7.2 vs. 2.0%; p < 0.0001), with 43 escherichia coli, 18 klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 klebsiella oxytoca and 1 proteus mirabilis being found. in the employment screening individuals, only e. coli was found. most esbl genes (79.4%, 50/63) were blactx-m type; blactx-m-15 was more frequent in the ltc applicants (p < 0.001). regarding esbl genes and integron diversity, e. coli isolates from the ltc applicants were more  similar to k. pneumoniae than to e. coli from the employment screening individuals. conclusion: these differences in the characteristics of esbl producers may represent different sources of colonization. most ltc applicants harboured k. pneumoniae or e. coli that were probably hospital-acquired whereas the e. coli isolates of many healthy individuals showed similarities to environmental e. coli.

TI  == observations on the current bacteriological profile of chronic suppurative otitis media in south eastern nigeria.
AB  == background: chronic suppurative otitis media (csom) is a disease well-known for its recurrence and persistence despite treatment. the situation is compounded by  the increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents by bacteria these days. aim: this study was carried out to examine the current local bacteriological profile of csom and to compare the profile of either ear in bilaterally discharging ears. materials and methods: we carried out a retrospective analysis of ear swab cultures from 133 unilateral and 73 bilateral consecutive tubotympanic csom cases seen at the ear-nose-throat clinics of a referral health institution during a 4 year period ending 2013. sensitivities to eight locally available antibiotics were analyzed. aerobic bacterial isolates were analyzed separately for the unilateral and bilateral cases. comparison was made between the ears in the bilateral cases. results: we analyzed 279 ear swab culture results from 206 patients with age ranging from 5 months to 86 years and a mean of 21.3 (19.5) years. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common isolated bacteria (44% [109/250]) followed by staphylococcus aureus (17% [42/250]), and proteus mirabilis (15% [38/250]). the most and least sensitive bacteria were klebsiella spp and escherichia coli, respectively. the most effective antibiotics were gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. the two ears differ significantly in the rates of isolation of s. aureus and e. coli (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). conclusion: pseudomonas is the most common bacteria involved in csom in this part of the country. ciprofloxacin as ear drops is recommended as first-line drug in the management of active csom as it is cheap, less ototoxic, and locally available. separate ear swab culture should be obtained in bilateral csom.

TI  == urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus saprophyticus. high recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. in this review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating  the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of utis. we also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for utis.

TI  == designing of dynamic polyethyleneimine (pei) brushes on polyurethane (pu) ureteral stents to prevent infections.
AB  == permanent antibacterial coatings have been developed by brush-like polyethyleneimine (pei) on polyurethane (pu) ureteral stents since bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation with the following encrustation on stent surface limit their long term usage. in order to control or prevent bacterial infections; pei chains with two different molecular weights (mn: 1800 or 60,000da) were covalently attached on the polyurethane (pu) surface by "grafting to" approach to obtain a brush-like structure. then, pei brushes were alkylated with bromohexane  to enhance the disruption of bacterial membranes with increasing polycationic character. x-ray photoelectron and infrared spectroscopy investigations confirmed that pei grafting and alkylation steps were performed successfully. surface roughness in dry state increased dramatically from 65.8nm to 277.7nm and 145.2nm  for short chain pei and long chain pei grafted samples, respectively. both low and high molecular weight pei grafts exhibited a brush-like structure and potent  antibacterial activity by lowering the adherence of klebsiella pneumonia, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis species up to two orders of magnitude without any cytotoxic effect on l929 and g/g cells. thus, permanent bactericidal  activity was achieved by the contact-active strategy of dynamic pei brush-like structures on polyurethane ureteral stent.

TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against enterobacteriaceae isolates from u.s. hospitals (2011 to 2013) and characterization of beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) inhibited 99.9% (20,698/20,709) of enterobacteriaceae isolates at </=8 mug/ml. this compound was  active against resistant subsets, including ceftazidime-nonsusceptible enterobacter cloacae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotype isolates. an esbl phenotype was noted among 12.4% (1,696/13,692 isolates from targeted species) of the isolates, including 776 escherichia coli (12.0% for this species; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 721 klebsiella pneumoniae (16.3%; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 119 klebsiella oxytoca (10.3%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mug/ml), and 80 proteus mirabilis (4.9%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) isolates. the most common enzymes detected among esbl phenotype isolates from 2013 (n = 743) screened using a microarray-based assay were ctx-m-15-like (n = 307), kpc (n = 120), shv esbls (n = 118), and ctx-m-14-like (n = 110). kpc producers were highly resistant to comparators, and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 98.3% susceptible) were the most active agents against these strains. meropenem (mic50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/ml) and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) were active against ctx-m-producing isolates. other enzymes were also observed, and ceftazidime-avibactam displayed good activity against the isolates producing less common enzymes. among 11 isolates displaying ceftazidime-avibactam mic values of >8 mug/ml, three were k. pneumoniae strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases (all ceftazidime-avibactam mics, >32 mug/ml), with two ndm-1 producers and one k. pneumoniae strain carrying the blakpc-2 and blavim-4 genes. therapeutic options for isolates producing beta-lactamases may be limited, and ceftazidime-avibactam, which displayed good activity against strains, including those producing kpc enzymes, merits further study in infections where such organisms occur.

TI  == colonization, competition, and dispersal of pathogens in fluid flow networks.
AB  == the colonization of bacteria in complex fluid flow networks, such as those found  in host vasculature, remains poorly understood. recently, it was reported that many bacteria, including bacillus subtilis [1], escherichia coli [2], and pseudomonas aeruginosa [3, 4], can move in the opposite direction of fluid flow.  upstream movement results from the interplay between fluid shear stress and bacterial motility structures, and such rheotactic-like behavior is predicted to  occur for a wide range of conditions [1]. given the potential ubiquity of upstream movement, its impact on population-level behaviors within hosts could be significant. here, we find that p. aeruginosa communities use a diverse set of motility strategies, including a novel surface-motility mechanism characterized by counter-advection and transverse diffusion, to rapidly disperse throughout vasculature-like flow networks. these motility modalities give p. aeruginosa a selective growth advantage, enabling it to self-segregate from other human pathogens such as proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus that outcompete p.  aeruginosa in well-mixed non-flow environments. we develop a quantitative model of bacterial colonization in flow networks, confirm our model in vivo in plant vasculature, and validate a key prediction that colonization and dispersal can be inhibited by modifying surface chemistry. our results show that the interaction between flow mechanics and motility structures shapes the formation of mixed-species communities and suggest a general mechanism by which bacteria could colonize hosts. furthermore, our results suggest novel strategies for tuning the  composition of multi-species bacterial communities in hosts, preventing inappropriate colonization in medical devices, and combatting bacterial infections.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the antimicrobial activity in urinary catheters and silicones in antibiotic-coated prosthetic urinary systems in order to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by catheter-associated infection. methods: the study was initiated in 1993 at houston, usa and continued in turkey till 1996. a  sterileplastic bag was used as kidney in the in vitro urinary system. physiological renal jet streams (50 cc/h) were generated with an intravenous metric pump. the temperature was kept at body temperature. the bladder drainage was achieved at the physiological drainage period of 4-6 hours during the 72-hour experiment. silicone surfaces coated with pure silicone and impregnated with minocycline-rifampin were exposed to the urine contaminated with the targeted bacteria in the in vitro urinary model for 72 hours. antimicrobial activities occurring in the eosin methylene blue and blood agar media in the infected silicones were assessed. results: minocycline-rifampin silicone surfaces exposed  to the urine contaminated with escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa reported reproduction. no reproduction was observed in the culture of minocycline- rifampin-impregnated silicone surfaces for proteus mirabilis.the difference with the control group was regarded as statistically significant for proteus mirabilis (p < 0.005). minocycline-rifampin-coated silicones were closely monitored only for proteus mirabilis in the in vitro urinary medium. although inhibition zones (< 10 mm) in the cultures were observed for minocycline-rifampin-coated silicones for escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the microbial efficacy was not regarded sufficient. conclusion: there is still need for evidence-based in vivo and in vitro studies where antimicrobial activity is evaluated on the surface of catheters.

TI  == polyphenolic extract from maple syrup potentiates antibiotic susceptibility and reduces biofilm formation of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == phenolic compounds are believed to be promising candidates as complementary therapeutics. maple syrup, prepared by concentrating the sap from the north american maple tree, is a rich source of natural and process-derived phenolic compounds. in this work, we report the antimicrobial activity of a phenolic-rich  maple syrup extract (prmse). prmse exhibited antimicrobial activity as well as strong synergistic interaction with selected antibiotics against gram-negative clinical strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among the phenolic constituents of prmse, catechol exhibited strong synergy with antibiotics as well as with other phenolic components of prmse against bacterial growth. at sublethal concentrations, prmse and catechol efficiently reduced biofilm formation and increased the susceptibility of bacterial biofilms to antibiotics. in an effort to elucidate the mechanism for the observed synergy with antibiotics, prmse was found to increase outer membrane permeability of all bacterial strains and effectively inhibit efflux pump activity. furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that prmse significantly repressed multiple-drug resistance genes as well as genes associated with motility, adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence. overall, this study provides a proof of concept and starting point for investigating the molecular mechanism of the reported increase in bacterial antibiotic susceptibility in the  presence of prmse.

TI  == spectrum of bacterial pathogens and their antibiogram from cases of urinary tract infection among renal disorder patients.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the commonest bacterial infection occurring in renal disorder patients and is associated with significant morbidity. resistance  to antibiotics is highly prevalent in bacterial isolates and is an emerging problem in uti. a hospital based cross sectional study was conducted from april 2011 to september 2011 to determine the frequency and bacterial profile of urinary tract infections in the patients with renal disorders visiting kist hospital along with their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. urine samples were collected from 300 clinically-suspected cases of uti among renal disorder patients and investigated by conventional semi-quantitative culture technique, microscopy and antibiotic susceptibility test. significant bacteriuria were detected in 34% of the total subjects, mostly from patients with chronic kidney disease. incidence of bacteriuria was found higher in females (40.40%) than in males (27.52%) and mostly occurred in elderly patients. escherichia coli (62.75%) was the predominant isolate followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (10.78%), staphylococcus aureus (9.80%), coagulase negative staphylococcus aureus (cons) (5.88%), enterococcus spp (3.92%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.00%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.00%), proteus mirabilis (2.00%) and proteus vulgaris (1.00%). multidrug resistance was observed in 68.82% of the total bacterial isolates.

TI  == bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in china: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of chinese county hospitals. a total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from august 2010 to august 2011. drug sensitivity  testing was conducted in a central laboratory. a total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of escherichia coli, 606 klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 staphylococcus aureus, 308 streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 haemophilus influenzae. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in e. coli (42.3% strains), k. pneumoniae (31.7%), and proteus mirabilis (39.0%). ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of e. coli strains. salmonella spp. and shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. less than 8.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. for s. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of s. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of h. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. azithromycin-resistant h. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive m. catarrhalis were recorded. in conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant  strains of e. coli and klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. the antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly,  with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.

TI  == propagation capacity of bacterial contaminants in platelet concentrates using a luciferase reporter system.
AB  == introduction: currently the use of molecular tools and techniques of genetic engineering in the study of microbial behavior in blood components has replaced the employment of classical methods of microbiology. this work focuses on the use of a novel lux reporter system for monitoring the contaminating propagation capacity of bacteria present in platelet concentrates under standard storage conditions in the blood bank. methods: a minitn5 promotor probe carrying the lux  operon from photorhabdus luminiscens (putminitn5luxcdabekm2) was used to construct four bacterial bioluminescent mutants: escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. luminescent mutants were used for contamination tests with 20 cfu in platelet concentrates bags and were stored under standard storage conditions in the blood bank (100 rpm at 22 degrees c). the measurements of luminous activity and optical density were used to monitor bacterial proliferation during 7 days (168 h). results: during the exponential growth phase (log) of bacterial strains, a lineal correlation between luminous activity vs biomass was observed (r(2) = 0.985, 0.976, 0.981) for e. coli::tn5luxcdabekm2, p. mirabilis::tn5luxcdabekm2 and p. auriginosa::tn5luxcdabekm2, respectively. the above indicates that metabolic activity (production of atp) is directly related to biomass in this phase of microbial growth. while conducting experiments, the inability to propagate s. typhi::tn5luxcdabekm2 was detected. we can speculate that platelet concentrates contain specific components that prevent the propagation of s. typhi. conclusion: the use of luxcdabe system for the quantification of luminous activity is a rapid and sensitive alternative to study the propagation and auto-sterilization of bacterial contaminants in platelet concentrates.

TI  == antimicrobial and antifungal activity of pelargonium roseum essential oils.
AB  == purpose: the antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the xx(th) century. in the current study essential oils obtained from pelargonium roseum (geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the pelargonium essential oil was tested against gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and  fungi (candida albicans). disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. results: inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. in the case of candida albicans, the  complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. in the cases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. conclusion: the volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. there were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available pelargonium oils.

TI  == rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

TI  == inhibition of quorum sensing mediated biofilm development and virulence in uropathogens by hyptis suaveolens.
AB  == bacterial urinary tract infections (utis) are the most common nosocomial infections, accounting for about 40 % of all hospital-acquired infections. the bacterial spectrum of nosocomial utis is broad and the treatment of utis is becoming difficult owing to the emergence of drug resistance. therefore, it is reasonable to investigate novel and alternative therapeutic strategies to treat utis. since utis are caused by uropathogens with quorum sensing (qs)-dependent biofilm forming abilities, interruption of qs systems may be a novel approach to  combat drug resistance. in the present study, a methanol extract (and hexane extract derived from it) of the medicinal plant hyptis suaveolens (l.) were shown to have anti-qs activity against the biosensor strain chromobacterium violaceum (atcc 12472). furthermore, the hexane extract of h. suaveolens (hehs) inhibited biofilm formation by uropathogens such as escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens. hehs promotes the loosening of biofilm architecture and strongly inhibits in vitro biofilm formation by uropathogens, which was more apparent from microscopic images. in addition to this, hehs reduces the production of qs-dependent virulence factors like protease and hemolysin, along with motility. the partial purification and gc-ms analysis of the active fraction revealed the presence of several therapeutically important compounds which may synergistically act on the uropathogens and possibly reduce the qs-dependent phenotypes. these findings suggest hehs as potential phytotherapeutic agent which can be employed to formulate protective strategies against biofilm linked infections caused by uropathogens.

TI  == biomaterial modification of urinary catheters with antimicrobials to give long-term broadspectrum antibiofilm activity.
AB  == catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the commonest hospital-acquired infection, accounting for over 100,000 hospital admissions within the usa annually. biomaterials and processes intended to reduce the risk of bacterial colonization of the catheters for long-term users have not been successful, mainly because of the need for long duration of activity in flow conditions. here we report the results of impregnation of urinary catheters with  a combination of rifampicin, sparfloxacin and triclosan. in flow experiments, the antimicrobial catheters were able to prevent colonization by common uropathogens  proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli for 7 to 12weeks in vitro compared with 1-3days for other, commercially available antimicrobial catheters currently used clinically. resistance development was minimized by careful choice of antimicrobial combinations. drug release profiles and distribution in the polymer, and surface analysis were also carried out and the process had no deleterious effect on the mechanical performance of the catheter or its balloon. the antimicrobial catheter therefore offers for the first time a  means of reducing infection and its complications in long-term urinary catheter users.

TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota of the conjunctiva in diabetic patients with normal  and altered glycated hemoglobin levels in two regions in brazil.
AB  == purpose: to study the aerobic bacterial microbiota of the conjunctiva in diabetic patients with regard to the management of diabetes, assessed using glycated hemoglobin levels. methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted using conjunctival smears of diabetic patients from both sexes and with different ages, residing in two different brazilian cities (sorocaba and rio branco). a control group of non-diabetic patients was also included. the diabetic patients were considered to have controlled diabetes when their glycated hemoglobin level was </=7% and blood glucose level was </=126 mg/dl. patients with non-controlled diabetes were those with glycated hemoglobin levels >7% and blood glucose levels  >126 mg/dl. the samples obtained were inoculated in brain-heart infusion broth and in culture media for aerobic bacteria (blood and chocolate agars); bacterial  growth was evaluated in a microbiology laboratory. results: a total of 120 eyes of 120 patients were included in the present study. the percentage of cultures in which bacterial growth was observed was greater in diabetic patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.103). there was a greater trend toward bacterial growth in the conjunctiva of diabetic patients with altered fasting blood glucose. there was no difference in the frequency of bacterial growth on the conjunctiva between diabetic patients with normal or altered glycated hemoglobin levels. in sorocaba, conjunctival bacterial growth was similar to that observed in rio branco. the microorganism most frequently detected in the present study was staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli. conclusion: there was no difference between diabetic patients with normal or altered glycated hemoglobin levels. the microorganisms found were similar to those found in studies investigating the conjunctival bacterial flora of diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

TI  == identification and phenotypic characterization of the most frequent bacterial etiologies in chronic skin ulcers.
AB  == chronic wounds represent an important burden on the healthcare system, requiring  frequent hospitalizations and expensive treatments. it is now recognized that a primary factor contributing to a non-healing trajectory and a low therapeutic response is the biofilm infection. the purpose of this study was to identify the  bacterial isolates collected from chronic skin wounds of hospitalized patients and to evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, virulence factors, as well as the ability to develop biofilms in vitro. a number of 44 wound samples were collected from 39 patients. the isolated strains belonged to seven different microbial species, i.e.: staphylococcus aureus (32 strains), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), proteus mirabilis (1), citrobacter freundii (1), group g beta-hemolytic streptococci (1). in comparison to the other isolates, p. aeruginosa strains exhibited the highest capacity to develop complex biofilm structures in vitro, followed by s. aureus, with insignificant differences between mrsa and non-methicillin resistant isolates. the enterobacteriaceae strains expressed less virulent phenotypes, lower adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm forming capacity, but also significant resistance phenotypes with a potential of unfavorable epidemiological outcome. the isolation of mrsa, esbl-producing microorganisms and multiple antibiotic resistant p. aeruginosa suggests the potential risk of nosocomial spread and the potential severe outcome in case of bacteremia and sepsis. this study represents an important step in elucidating the host-wound microbiome interaction, by describing various resistance and virulence threats of microorganisms colonizing and/or infecting the chronic wounds. however, in order to establish a statistical relevant correlation, larger studies are needed.

TI  == preferential use of central metabolism in vivo reveals a nutritional basis for polymicrobial infection.
AB  == the human genitourinary tract is a common anatomical niche for polymicrobial infection and a leading site for the development of bacteremia and sepsis. most uncomplicated, community-acquired urinary tract infections (uti) are caused by escherichia coli, while another bacterium, proteus mirabilis, is more often associated with complicated uti. here, we report that uropathogenic e. coli and p. mirabilis have divergent requirements for specific central pathways in vivo despite colonizing and occupying the same host environment. using mutants of specific central metabolism enzymes, we determined glycolysis mutants lacking pgi, tpia, pfka, or pyka all have fitness defects in vivo for p. mirabilis but do not affect colonization of e. coli during uti. similarly, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is required only for p. mirabilis in vivo. in contrast, gluconeogenesis is required only for e. coli fitness in vivo. the remarkable difference in central pathway utilization between e. coli and p. mirabilis during experimental uti was also observed for tca cycle mutants in sdhb, fumc, and frda. the distinct in vivo requirements between these pathogens suggest e. coli and p.  mirabilis are not direct competitors within host urinary tract nutritional niche. in support of this, we found that co-infection with e. coli and p. mirabilis wild-type strains enhanced bacterial colonization and persistence of both pathogens during uti. our results reveal that complementary utilization of central carbon metabolism facilitates polymicrobial disease and suggests microbial activity in vivo alters the host urinary tract nutritional niche.

AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) caused by uropathogenic escherichia coli (upec) and proteus mirabilis are among the most common infections in the world. currently there are no vaccines available to confer protection against uti in humans. in this study, the immune responses and protection of fimh of upec with mrph antigen of p. mirabilis in different vaccine formulations with and without mpl adjuvant were assessed. mice intranasally immunized with the novel fusion protein mrph.fimh induced a significant increase in igg and iga in serum, nasal wash, vaginal wash, and urine samples. mice immunized with fusion mrph.fimh also  showed a significant boost in cellular immunity. addition of mpl as the adjuvant  enhanced fimh and mrph specific humoral and cellular responses in both systemic and mucosal samples. vaccination with mrph.fimh alone or in combination with mpl  showed the highest efficiency in clearing bladder and kidney infections in mice challenged with upec and p. mirabilis. these findings may indicate that the protection observed correlates with the systemic, mucosal and cellular immune responses induced by vaccination with these preparations. our data suggest mrph.fimh fusion protein with or without mpl as adjuvant could be potential vaccine candidates for elimination of upec and p. mirabilis. these data altogether are promising and these formulations are good candidates for elimination of upec and p. mirabilis.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamases in faecal enterobacteriaceae recovered from healthy humans in spain: focusing on ampc polymorphisms.
AB  == the intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampc genes in species of citrobacter, enterobacter or escherichia genera. in this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampc beta-lactamase  genes. fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 escherichia coli, 4 citrobacter braakii, 9 citrobacter freundii, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 proteus vulgaris, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 serratia sp. and 1 cronobacter sp. a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the ampc phenotype in 22  isolates (31 %) and the esbl phenotype in 3 isolates. ampc molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla cmy and bla act genes from citrobacter and enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. the prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampc genes obtained in this study was 2 %. the unique plasmid-mediated bla ampc identified in this study was the bla cmy-2 gene, detected in an e. coli isolate ascribed to  the sequence type st405 which belonged to phylogenetic group d. the hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the isecp1-bla cmy-2-blc structure  was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable inck plasmid. this study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. extensive ampc-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.

AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are the second most common bacterial infection. urine culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but new techniques, such as flow cytometry analysis (fca), have been introduced. the aim of the present study was to evaluate fca characteristics regarding bacteriuria, leukocyturia, and erythrocyturia in relation to cultured uropathogens in specimens from patients with a suspected uti. we also wanted to evaluate whether the fca characteristics  can identify uropathogens prior to culture. from a prospective study, 1,587 consecutive urine specimens underwent fca prior to culture during january and february 2012. outpatients and inpatients (79.6% and 19.4%, respectively) were included, of whom women represented 67.5%. in total, 620 specimens yielded growth, of which escherichia coli represented 65%, enterococcus spp. 8%, klebsiella spp. 7%, and staphylococcus spp. 5%. for the uropathogens, the outcome of fca was compared against the results for specimens with e. coli and those with a negative culture. e. coli had high bacterial (median, 17,914/mul), leukocyte (median, 348/mul), and erythrocyte (median, 23/mul) counts. with the exception of klebsiella spp., the majority of the uropathogens had considerable or significantly lower bacterial counts than that of e. coli. high leukocyte counts  were found in specimens with staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group c streptococci. elevated erythrocyte counts were found for p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, and group c streptococci, as well as for staphylococcus saprophyticus. in essence, fca adds new information about the  bacterial, leukocyte, and erythrocyte counts in urine specimens for different uropathogens. based on fca characteristics, uropathogens can be classified and identified prior to culture. e. coli and klebsiella spp. have similar fca characteristics.

TI  == synthesis, characterization and biological activity of new mixed ligand complexes of zn(ii) naproxen with nitrogen based ligands.
AB  == a series of novel zn(ii) complexes [zn2(nap)4] (1), [zn(nap)21,10-phen](2), [zn(nap)22,9-dmphen] (3), [zn(nap)2(2-ampy)2] (4), [zn(nap)2(imid)2] (5), [zn(nap)2(1,2-dmimid)2] (6) (nap = naproxen, 1,10-phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,9-dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 2-ampy = 2-aminopyridine, imid = imidazole, 1,2-dmimid = 1,2-dimethyl imidazole) were synthesized and characterized using ir, uv-vis, (1)h nmr, (13)c{(1)h} nmr spectroscopy. the crystal structure of complex 3 was determined using single-crystal x-ray diffraction. in order to assess the effect of the metal ions on the anti-bacterial activity, complexes 1-6 have been screened in vitro, against (g(+)) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus) and (g(-)) bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli) using the agar well diffusion method. complex 2 was the only complex that showed antibacterial activity against p. aeruginosa, where the complexation of the parent ligand 1,10-phenathroline enhanced significantly the activity. all the complexes showed different activity against the different bacteria, and were compared with activity of the parent ligands. the complexes were tested also for their anti-malarial activity using two methods: a semi-quantitative micro-assay and a previously self-developed quantitative in-vitro method. both were used to study the efficiency of these complexes in inhibiting the formation of the malaria pigment. this is considered an important  target of many known anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine and amodaquine. results showed that the efficiency of complex 3 in preventing the formation of beta-hematin was 75%. the efficiency of amodiaquine as a standard drug was reported to give 92.5.

TI  == beta-lactamases produced by amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant enterobacteria isolated in buenos aires, argentina: a new blatem gene.
AB  == resistance to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors in enterobacteria is a growing problem that has not been intensively studied in argentina. in the present work, 54/843 enterobacteria collected in a teaching hospital of buenos aires city were ampicillin-sulbactam-resistant isolates remaining susceptible to  second- and third-generation cephalosporins. the enzymatic mechanisms present in  the isolates, which were also amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amc)-resistant (18/54) were herein analyzed. sequencing revealed two different variants of blatem-1, being blatem-1b the most frequently detected allelle (10 escherichia coli, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 proteus mirabilis and 1 raoultella terrigena) followed by blatem-1a (1 k. pneumoniae). amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance seems to be mainly associated with tem-1 overproduction (mostly in e. coli) or co-expressed with oxa-2-like and/or shv beta-lactamases (k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis). a new blatem variant (tem-163) was described in an e. coli strain having an amc mic value of 16/8mug/ml. tem-163 contains arg275gln and his289leu amino acid substitutions. on the basis of the high specific activity and low ic50 for clavulanic acid observed, the resistance pattern seems to be due to overproduction of the new variant of broad spectrum beta-lactamase rather than to an inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-like behavior.

TI  == wild mushroom extracts as inhibitors of bacterial biofilm formation.
AB  == microorganisms can colonize a wide variety of medical devices, putting patients in risk for local and systemic infectious complications, including local-site infections, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and endocarditis. these microorganisms are able to grow adhered to almost every surface, forming architecturally complex communities termed biofilms. the use of natural products  has been extremely successful in the discovery of new medicine, and mushrooms could be a source of natural antimicrobials. the present study reports the capacity of wild mushroom extracts to inhibit in vitro biofilm formation by multi-resistant bacteria. four gram-negative bacteria biofilm producers (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) isolated from urine were used to verify the activity of russula delica, fistulina hepatica, mycena rosea, leucopaxilus giganteus, and lepista nuda extracts. the results obtained showed that all tested mushroom extracts presented some extent of inhibition of biofilm production. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the microorganism with the highest capacity of biofilm production, being also the most susceptible to the extracts inhibition capacity (equal or higher than 50%). among the five tested extracts against e. coli, leucopaxillus giganteus (47.8%) and mycenas rosea (44.8%) presented the highest inhibition of biofilm formation. the extracts exhibiting the highest inhibitory effect upon p. mirabilis biofilm formation were sarcodon imbricatus (45.4%) and russula delica (53.1%). acinetobacter baumannii was the microorganism with the lowest susceptibility to mushroom extracts inhibitory effect on biofilm production (highest inhibition-almost 29%, by russula delica extract). this is a pioneer study since, as far as we know, there are no reports on the inhibition of biofilm production by the studied mushroom extracts and in particular against multi-resistant clinical isolates; nevertheless, other studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of action.

TI  == gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  == wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. however, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. for this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis)  were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. by applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; mycobacterium bolletii, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium botulinum. the genus treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified  at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. using specific real-time pcr on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria bartonella spp. borrelia spp., coxiella burnetii and tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. we estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.

TI  == asymptomatic bacteriuria escherichia coli are live biotherapeutics for uti.
AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) account for approximately 8 million clinic visits  annually with symptoms that include acute pelvic pain, dysuria, and irritative voiding. empiric uti management with antimicrobials is complicated by increasing  antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens, but live biotherapeutics products (lbps), such as asymptomatic bacteriuria (asb) strains of e. coli, offer the potential to circumvent antimicrobial resistance. here we evaluated asb e. coli as lbps, relative to ciprofloxacin, for efficacy against infection and visceral pain in a murine uti model. visceral pain was quantified as tactile allodynia of  the pelvic region in response to mechanical stimulation with von frey filaments.  whereas ciprofloxacin promoted clearance of uropathogenic e. coli (upec), it did  not reduce pelvic tactile allodynia, a measure of visceral pain. in contrast, asb e. coli administered intravesically or intravaginally provided comparable reduction of allodynia similar to intravesical lidocaine. moreover, asb e. coli were similarly effective against uti allodynia induced by proteus mirabilis, enterococccus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae. therefore, asb e. coli have anti-infective activity comparable to the current standard of care yet also provide superior analgesia. these studies suggest that asb e. coli represent novel lbps for uti symptoms.

TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the european pond turtle (emys orbicularis) in poland.
AB  == we conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of european pond turtles (emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile  turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. we included 130  turtles in the study. the aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated  from free-living adults. we isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), enterococcus faecalis (96/96), escherichia coli (58/96), and proteus mirabilis (41/96). from the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., salmonella enterica  serovars newport, daytona, and braenderup; listeria monocytogenes; yersinia enterocolitica; yersinia ruckeri; klebsiella pneumoniae; vibrio fluvialis; and serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae, hafnia alvei, edwardsiella tarda, and citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). the cloacal bacterial biota of the european pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. the small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the european pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.

TI  == loss of flil alters proteus mirabilis surface sensing and temperature-dependent swarming.
AB  == proteus mirabilis is a dimorphic motile bacterium well known for its flagellum-dependent swarming motility over surfaces. in liquid, p. mirabilis cells are 1.5- to 2.0-mum swimmer cells with 4 to 6 flagella. when p. mirabilis encounters a solid surface, where flagellar rotation is limited, swimmer cells differentiate into elongated (10- to 80-mum), highly flagellated swarmer cells. in order for p. mirabilis to swarm, it first needs to detect a surface. the ubiquitous but functionally enigmatic flagellar basal body protein flil is involved in p. mirabilis surface sensing. previous studies have suggested that flil is essential for swarming through its involvement in viscosity-dependent monitoring of flagellar rotation. in this study, we constructed and characterized deltaflil mutants of p. mirabilis and escherichia coli. unexpectedly and unlike other flil mutants, both p. mirabilis and e. coli deltaflil cells swarm (swr(+)). further analysis revealed that p. mirabilis deltaflil cells also exhibit an alteration in their ability to sense a surface: e.g., deltaflil p. mirabilis cells swarm precociously over surfaces with low viscosity that normally impede wild-type swarming. precocious swarming is due to an increase in the number of elongated swarmer cells in the population. loss of flil also results in an inhibition of swarming at <30 degrees c. e. coli deltaflil cells also exhibit temperature-sensitive swarming. these results suggest an involvement of flil in the energetics and function of the flagellar motor.

TI  == protective immunity induced by the vaccination of recombinant proteus mirabilis ompa expressed in pichia pastoris.
AB  == proteus mirabilis (p. mirabilis) is a zoonotic pathogen that has recently presented a rising infection rate in the poultry industry. to develop an effective vaccine to protect chickens against p. mirabilis infection, ompa, one of the major outer membrane proteins of p. mirabilis, was expressed in pichia pastoris. the concentration of the expressed recombinant ompa protein reached 8.0mug/ml after induction for 96h with 1.0% methanol in the culture. in addition, ompa protein was confirmed by sds-page and western blot analysis using the antibody against escherichia coli-expressed ompa protein. taishan pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide, a known plant-derived adjuvant, was mixed into  the recombinant ompa protein to prepare the ompa subunit vaccine. we then subcutaneously inoculated this vaccine into chickens to examine the immunoprotective effects. elisa analysis indicated that an excellent antibody response against ompa was elicited in the vaccinated chickens. moreover, a high protection rate of 80.0% was observed in the vaccinated group, which was subsequently challenged with p. mirabilis. the results suggest that the eukaryotic p. mirabilis ompa was an ideal candidate protein for developing an effective subunit vaccine against p. mirabilis infection.

TI  == [phenotypic detection of beta-lactamases production in enterobacteriaceae].
AB  == introduction: beta-lactam antibiotics are the most commonly used antibacterial drugs. however, many bacteria have developed resistance to these antibiotics, and the most common form of resistance is the production of beta-lactamase enzymes. many members of the enterobacteriaceae family produce different types of these enzymes. objective: the aim of this study was to perform phenotypic detection of  production and identification of beta-lactamase type in enterobacteriaceae isolated from different clinical specimens from patients hospitalized in the clinical center of serbia. methods: the strains of enterobacteriaceae were collected between november 2011 and january 2012 in the laboratory of the clinical center of serbia.the isolates were identified according to the standard  microbiology procedures and confirmed by the vitek2 automated system. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method,  and the phenotypic detection of production and identification of beta-lactamases  was performed according to previously described methodologies. results: in this study, a total of 172 enterobacteriaceae strains were isolated. further testing was performed on 54/145 (37.2%) strains showing decreased susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics: 13/85 (15.3%) escherichia coli, 31/46 (67.4%) klebsiella pneumoniae and 10/14 (71.4%) proteus mirabilis. among them, 40/145 (27.6%) strains produced extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), 9/145 (6.2%)--ampc, 1/145 (0.7%)--k1 beta-lactamase and 4/145 (2.8%)--carbapenemases. carbapenemases  were predominantly detected in k. pneumoniae (75%). conclusion: enterobacteriaceae produce different types of beta-lactamases, and the most common type in our study was esbls. production of carbapenemases detected in enterobacteriaceae is also an associated problem.

TI  == burdock root extracts limit quorum-sensing-controlled phenotypes and biofilm architecture in major urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are serious concern in patients infected with urinary tract infections, complicated urinary tract infections and other device-associated infections. microbes within the biofilms are effectively shielded from antibiotics and host immune cells, hence can be treated only with agents which has the potential to disassemble the biofilms. the study is focused on the root extracts of arctium lappa linn. as a source for complementary medicine against three major biofilm forming clinical isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens. methanol extracts of burdock roots (br) showed no bactericidal activity (p > 0.05) against the uropathogens, whereas restrained the biofilms (p < 0.05) on polystyrene and glass surfaces at a biofilm inhibitory concentration of 100 microg/ml. the 3d confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to analyze the biofilm architecture which showed significant  reduction in the surface area. z-stack analysis has also revealed substantial reduction in the biofilm thickness (e. coli-50.79%, p. mirabilis-69.49%, and s. marcescens-75.84%). further, br extracts also inhibited quorum-sensing (qs)-controlled cellular phenotypes such as violacein, prodigiosin, swarming motility, and cell surface hydrophobicity. lc-ms/ms analysis of br extracts identified the presence of two major quercetin derivatives (miquelianin and peltatoside) along with few other constituent components. exploring such phytocompounds will provide potential agents to treat infections caused by biofilm forming uropathogens. the antibiofilm and anti-qs agents will ultimately  serve as armor, facilitating the host immune system to fight infections.

TI  == preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  == the ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (cdh) to produce hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. a recombinantly produced cdh from myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mm or 2 mm cellobiose as substrate. biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by cdh when supplemented with 1mm cellobiose. the cdh/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. interestingly, cdh was also able to produce h(2)o(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exps) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. the h(2)o(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exps were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for cdh as well as destabilises the biofilm. furthermore, cdh suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. incorporation of the cdh/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore  makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.

TI  == the influence of urinary ph on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the effects of ph on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including ph. because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (ph 4.5) to alkaline (ph 8) conditions and can be  easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of ph in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. materials and  methods: this in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) over the  range of ph 5-8. standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. one-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (p <.05). results: for 18 of the 24 agents, ph was shown to play a significant role  in overall inhibitory activity. although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed ph-dependent effects  against certain organisms. the fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline ph, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by ph. conclusion: clinicians should consider the urinary ph of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. future clinical investigations examining urinary ph and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.

TI  == strain diversity of ctx-m-producing enterobacteriaceae in individual pigs: insights into the dynamics of shedding during the production cycle.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the population dynamics of ctx-m-producing  enterobacteriaceae in individual pigs on a farm positive for ctx-m-14-producing escherichia coli. fecal samples were collected once around the farrowing time from five sows and four times along the production cycle from two of their respective offspring. multiple colonies per sample were isolated on cefotaxime-supplemented macconkey agar with or without prior enrichment, resulting in 98 isolates identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and tested for blactx-m. ctx-m-positive isolates (n = 86) were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). plasmids harboring blactx-m were characterized in 22 representative isolates by replicon typing and restriction fragment length polymorphism. based on the pfge results, all individuals shed unrelated ctx-m-14-producing e. coli strains during the course of life. concomitant shedding of ctx-m-2/97-producing proteus mirabilis or providencia rettgeri was observed in two sows and two offspring. at least two genetically unrelated ctx-m-producing e. coli strains were isolated from approximately one-fourth of the samples, with remarkable differences between isolates obtained by enrichment and direct plating. a clear decrease in strain diversity was observed after weaning. dissemination of blactx-m-14 within the farm was attributed to horizontal transfer of an inck plasmid that did not carry additional resistance genes and persisted in the absence of antimicrobial selective pressure. assessment of strain diversity was shown to be influenced by the production stage from which samples were collected, as well as by the isolation method, providing useful information for the design and interpretation of future epidemiological studies of ctx-m-producing enterobacteriaceae in pig farms.

TI  == bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  == the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial  cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would  allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.

TI  == structural and functional features of crl proteins and identification of conserved surface residues required for interaction with the rpos/sigmas subunit  of rna polymerase.
AB  == in many gamma-proteobacteria, the rpos/sigmas sigma factor associates with the core rnap (rna polymerase) to modify global gene transcription in stationary phase and under stress conditions. the small regulatory protein crl stimulates the association of sigmas with the core rnap in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, through direct and specific interaction with sigmas. the structural determinants of crl involved in sigmas binding are unknown. in the present paper we report the x-ray crystal structure of the proteus mirabilis crl protein (crlpm) and a structural model for salmonella typhimurium crl (crlstm). using a combination of in vivo and in vitro assays, we  demonstrated that crlstm and crlpm are structurally similar and perform the same  biological function. in the crl structure, a cavity enclosed by flexible arms contains two patches of conserved and exposed residues required for sigmas binding. among these, charged residues that are likely to be involved in electrostatic interactions driving crl-sigmas complex formation were identified.  crlstm and crlpm interact with domain 2 of sigmas with the same binding properties as with full-length sigmas. these results suggest that crl family members share a common mechanism of sigmas binding in which the flexible arms of  crl might play a dynamic role.

TI  == structure-activity relationship studies of microbiologically active thiosemicarbazides derived from hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazides.
AB  == forty-five derivatives of thiosemicarbazide were synthesized, and their antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was evaluated. some of the described compounds exhibited interesting activity against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria, whereas only two derivatives had the ability to inhibit the growth of gram-negative species (escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 13883, proteus mirabilis atcc 12453). the most  potent antimicrobial activity was observed in the cases of salicylic acid hydrazide derivatives. the differences in activity inspired us to conduct conformational analysis using molecular mechanics level. the obtained results suggest that the molecule geometry, especially at the n4-terminus of thiosemicarbazide skeleton, determines the antibacterial activity. unfortunately, in opposition to what we expected, only one of the tested compounds inhibited the activity of the topoiv enzyme, and none of them was active against dna gyrase.

TI  == antibiotic consumption and its influence on the resistance in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the most serious problems in current medicine. an important factor contributing to the growing prevalence of multiresistant bacteria is application of antibiotics. this study aimed at analyzing the development of resistance of enterobacteriaceae to selected beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics in the university hospital olomouc and assessing the effect of selection pressure of these antibiotics. methods: for the period between 1 january 2000 and 31 december 2011, resistance of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, meropenem,  piperacillin/tazobactam, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides was retrospectively studied. for the assessment of selection pressure of antibiotics, a parameter of  defined daily dose in absolute annual consumption (dddatb) based on the atc/ddd classification and in relative annual consumption (rdddatb) as the number of defined daily doses per 100 bed-days was used. the relationship between frequency of strains resistant to a particular antibiotic and antibiotic consumption was assessed by linear regression analysis using spearman's correlation. the level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. results: a total of 113,027 isolates from the enterobacteriaceae family were analyzed. there was a significant effect of selection pressure of the primary antibiotic in the following cases: piperacillin/tazobactam in klebsiella pneumoniae, gentamicin in  klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli and amikacin in escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. also, there was significant correlation between resistance  to ceftazidime and consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam in klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. no relationship was found between consumption of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and resistance to ceftazidime or between fluoroquinolone consumption and resistance to ciprofloxacin. conclusion:  the study showed the effects of both direct and indirect selection pressure on increasing resistance to gentamicin, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. given the fact that no correlation was found between resistance to fluoroquinolones and consumption of either primary or secondary antibiotics, we assume that the increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones is probably due to circulation of resistance genes in the bacterial population and that this resistance was not affected by reduced use of these antibiotics.

TI  == role of the bacterial vaccine solco-urovac(r) in treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections of bacterial origin.
AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) represent a serious medical problem with considerably high rate of morbidity. recurrent episodes of urinary tract infection (ruti) may commonly develop in the way of relapse or reinfection. for patients, ruti is always associated with costs, discomfort and decreased quality  of life. standard treatment of ruti is through antibiotics and usually such treatment is required repeatedly. repeat course of antibiotics leads to increase  of resistance of uropathogenic strains. according to the european association of  urology, "the present state of microbial resistance development is alarming". our post-marketing trial was designed to demonstrate the substantial effect of the bacterial vaccine solco-urovac(r) both with independent administration and in conjunction with standard antibacterial medication within therapy and prevention  of ruti. total of 115 patients (men and non-pregnant women) were enrolled in our  open-label post-marketing trial. each patient had more than one year history of ruti and in the past had already taken appropriate course of standard therapy. the trial group included 50 patients: 32 men, 18 women (average age +/- 32.5). 32 patients (men) of the trial group received vaccination with solco-urovac(r) together with the standard antibacterial medication. according to bacteriologic tests, in 62% cases infection was caused by escherichia coli, and in 38% cases by morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis. 18 patients within the trial group were women with no recurrence episode at the start and during the trial period. each woman was involved as the  intercourse partner of the respective man within the trial group. the women received only vaccination with solco-urovac(r). 65 patients of the control group  had more than one year history of ruti and had been treated earlier, too. patients of the control group received appropriate antibacterial medication without solco-urovac(r). after therapy and follow-up examination, results in the  both groups were classified, also in consideration of the pathogen-specified subgroups, and then summarized and compared respectively. during the follow-up period no case of ruti was noticed in women. in total, analysis of the medical records of 50 patients of the trial group demonstrated no case of ruti in 46 patients during the follow-up period. altogether, the rate of improvement of symptoms was as follows: the trial group - 92%, the control group - 74%. through  comparison with the past medical histories of patients, the higher rate of improvement and longer absence of ruti episodes after treatment were certainly associated with the effect of solco-urovac(r). the results of our post-marketing  trial allow recommending solco-urovac(r) for appropriate reference within the georgian national guideline on urologic infections.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular characterization of plasmid mediated ampc beta-lactamases among escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and proteus mirabilis isolated from urinary tract infections in egyptian hospitals.
AB  == the incidence of resistance by enterobacteriaceae to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors combination is increasing in egypt. three phenotypic techniques, comprising ampc disk diffusion and inhibition dependent methods using phenylboronic acid (pba) and cloxacillin, were compared to pcr based method for detection of plasmid mediated ampc beta-lactamase in common urinary tract isolates. a total of 143 isolates, including e. coli, klebsiella pneumonia, and proteus mirabilis, were collected from urinary tract infections cases in egyptian hospitals. plasmid encoded ampc genes were detected by pcr in 88.46% of cefoxitin resistant isolates. the most prevalent ampc gene family was cit including cmy-2,  cmy-4, and two cmy-2 variants. the second prevalent gene was dha-1 which was detected in e. coli and klebsiella pneumonia. the genes ebc, fox, and mox were also detected but in small percentage. some isolates were identified as having more than one pampc gene. the overall sensitivity and specificity of phenotypic tests for detection of ampc beta-lactamase showed that ampc disk diffusion and inhibition dependent method by cloxacillin were the most sensitive and the most specific disk tests. pcr remains the gold standard for detection of ampc beta-lactamases. this study represents the first report of cmy-2 variants of cmy-42 and cmy-102 beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, klebsiella pneumonia, and proteus mirabilis isolates in egypt.

TI  == structure of the rna polymerase assembly factor crl and identification of its interaction surface with sigma s.
AB  == bacteria utilize multiple sigma factors that associate with core rna polymerase (rnap) to control transcription in response to changes in environmental conditions. in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, crl positively regulates the sigma(s) regulon by binding to sigma(s) to promote its association with core  rnap. we recently characterized the determinants in sigma(s) responsible for specific binding to crl. however, little is known about the determinants in crl required for this interaction. here, we present the x-ray crystal structure of a  crl homolog from proteus mirabilis in conjunction with in vivo and in vitro approaches that probe the crl-sigma(s) interaction in e. coli. we show that the p. mirabilis, vibrio harveyi, and e. coli crl homologs function similarly in e. coli, indicating that crl structure and function are likely conserved throughout  gammaproteobacteria. we utilize phylogenetic conservation and bacterial two-hybrid analyses to predict residues in crl important for the interaction with sigma(s). the results of p-benzoylphenylalanine (bpa)-mediated uv cross-linking studies further support the model in which an evolutionarily conserved central cleft is the surface on crl that binds to sigma(s). within this conserved binding surface, we identify a key residue in crl that is critical for activation of esigma(s)-dependent transcription in vivo and in vitro. our study provides a physical basis for understanding the sigma(s)-crl interaction.

AB  == background: the misuse of antimicrobial agents increases drug resistance in bacteria. methods: the correlation between antimicrobial agent consumption and related resistance in the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis was analyzed during the period 2003-2011. results: among these five bacteria, overall e. coli and k. pneumoniae were more commonly isolated from bloodstream than the other species. regarding enterobacteriaceae, e. coli and k.  pneumoniae showed annual increases of resistance to the tested antimicrobial agents; conversely, p. mirabilis exhibited reduced resistance to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. in contrast to the relatively low antimicrobial resistance in p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii revealed high resistance, which was over 85% resistant rate to the tested antimicrobial agents and over 80% carbapenem resistance in 2011. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis differed  in development of antimicrobial resistance after consumption of the antimicrobial agents. k. pneumoniae developed resistance to all antimicrobial groups, whereas resistance in p. mirabilis was not related to any antimicrobial consumption. p. aeruginosa developed resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, whereas a. baumanii developed resistance to carbapenems after their use. conclusion: the development of antimicrobial resistance was related to antimicrobial agents and bacterial species.

TI  == [clinical distribution and antimicrobial resistance analysis of 754 pathogenic bacteria in diabetic foot infection].
AB  == objective: to explore the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibility  patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers so as to provide selection rationales of antibiotics. methods: a retrospective study was conducted on the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibilities in 754 strains of pathogens isolated from 519 patients with diabetic foot ulcers at our hospital from january 2010 to august 2013. the inter-group data were compared by chi-square test. results: there were 322 (62.0%) males and 197 (38.0%) females. their mean age was (67.7 +/- 12.3) (30-93) years, duration of diabetes 10 (0-40)  years, duration of lower-limb lesion 1.0 (0.0-72.0) months and hba1c (9.09% +/- 2.28%). among 444 (85.5%) cases, a total of 754 strains of pathogens were isolated. gram-positive aerobes were the most frequently isolated (47.3%, 357 strains) and followed by gram-negative aerobes and fungus (40.3% vs 12.3%, 304 vs 93 strains respectively). with rising wagner's grades, bacterial floras transformed from gram-positive cocci to gram-negative rods while fungus and composite infections increased. and 122 strains were of multi drug resistant organisms (mdro). among 357 strains of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis were dominating floras. staphylococcus was highly resistant to penicillin g, erythromycin, and oxacillin while vancomycin and linezolid were the most effective agents against gram-positive bacteria. among 304 strains of gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteria were the most prevalent, including 48 strains of escherichia coli, 34 strains of proteus mirabilis and 31 strains of proteus vulgaris. and there were 29 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. enterobacteria were highly resistant to ampicillin, followed by bactrim and furadantin while meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/sulbactam, sulperazone and cefepime were the most effective agents.  the predominant fungus was blastomyces albicans. conclusions: in patients with severe diabetic foot ulcers, gram-negative rods predominate while the prevalence  of fungus and composite infections increases. vancomycin and imipenem maintain highly antibacterial activity. it is essential to pay attention to pathogen survey and use antibiotics more rationally.

TI  == crystal structure of the dithiol oxidase dsba enzyme from proteus mirabilis bound non-covalently to an active site peptide ligand.
AB  == the disulfide bond forming dsba enzymes and their dsbb interaction partners are attractive targets for development of antivirulence drugs because both are essential for virulence factor assembly in gram-negative pathogens. here we characterize pmdsba from proteus mirabilis, a bacterial pathogen increasingly associated with multidrug resistance. pmdsba exhibits the characteristic properties of a dsba, including an oxidizing potential, destabilizing disulfide,  acidic active site cysteine, and dithiol oxidase catalytic activity. we evaluated a peptide, pwatcds, derived from the partner protein dsbb and showed by thermal shift and isothermal titration calorimetry that it binds to pmdsba. the crystal structures of pmdsba, and the active site variant pmdsbac30s were determined to high resolution. analysis of these structures allows categorization of pmdsba into the dsba class exemplified by the archetypal escherichia coli dsba enzyme. we also present a crystal structure of pmdsbac30s in complex with the peptide pwatcds. the structure shows that the peptide binds non-covalently to the active  site cxxc motif, the cis-pro loop, and the hydrophobic groove adjacent to the active site of the enzyme. this high-resolution structural data provides a critical advance for future structure-based design of non-covalent peptidomimetic inhibitors. such inhibitors would represent an entirely new antibacterial class that work by switching off the dsb virulence assembly machinery.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility and distribution of beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae causing intra-abdominal infections in north america 2010-2011.
AB  == the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends has been monitoring the  activity of antimicrobials indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections since 2004. this report documents the in vitro activity of several recommended antimicrobials against 3449 gram-negative bacilli isolated from the 30 and 25 participating sites in north america in 2010-2011, respectively, and characterizes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) identified in esbl-positive and ertapenem-non-susceptible isolates of enterobacteriaceae. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and morganella morgannii were the most common species isolated. the incidence of beta-lactamase production was 8.8% and 8.9% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, respectively. overall the most active antimicrobials were amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, although beta-lactamase production reduced the activity of most agents. characterization of beta-lactamase genes determined that bla(shv), bla(ctx-m), bla(ampc), and bla(kpc) were commonly found in most beta-lactamase-positive isolates.

TI  == characterization of 17 chaperone-usher fimbriae encoded by proteus mirabilis reveals strong conservation.
AB  == proteus mirabilis is a gram-negative enteric bacterium that causes complicated urinary tract infections, particularly in patients with indwelling catheters. sequencing of clinical isolate p. mirabilis hi4320 revealed the presence of 17 predicted chaperone-usher fimbrial operons. we classified these fimbriae into three groups by their genetic relationship to other chaperone-usher fimbriae. sixteen of these fimbriae are encoded by all seven currently sequenced p. mirabilis genomes. the predicted protein sequence of the major structural subunit for 14 of these fimbriae was highly conserved (>/= 95% identity), whereas three other structural subunits (fim3a, ucaa and fim6a) were variable. further examination of 58 clinical isolates showed that 14 of the 17 predicted major structural subunit genes of the fimbriae were present in most strains (>85%). transcription of the predicted major structural subunit genes for all 17 fimbriae was measured under different culture conditions designed to mimic conditions in the urinary tract. the majority of the fimbrial genes were induced during stationary phase, static culture or colony growth when compared to exponential-phase aerated culture. major structural subunit proteins for six of these fimbriae were detected using ms of proteins sheared from the surface of broth-cultured p. mirabilis, demonstrating that this organism may produce multiple fimbriae within a single culture. the high degree of conservation of p.  mirabilis fimbriae stands in contrast to uropathogenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, which exhibit greater variability in their fimbrial repertoires. these findings suggest there may be evolutionary pressure for p. mirabilis to maintain a large fimbrial arsenal.

TI  == in vitro studies of epithelium-associated crystallization caused by uropathogens  during urinary calculi development.
AB  == infectious urinary stones account for about 10% of all urinary stones. in 50% of  cases urolithiasis is a recurrent illness, which can lead to the loss of a kidney if not properly treated. one of the reasons for recurrence of the disease may be  the ability of bacteria to invade urothelial cells, persist in the host cells and serve as potential reservoirs for infection. various uropathogens are associated  with the formation of bacteria-induced urinary stones but proteus mirabilis is the most commonly isolated (70%). an in vitro model was used in this study to analyze intracellular growth and crystallization in the presence of p. mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. human ureter (hu 609) and bladder (hcv 29) epithelial cell lines were infected with bacteria and incubated (3-72 h) in the presence of synthetic urine and amikacin to prevent extracellular bacterial growth. during the incubation the number of bacteria (cfu/ml) inside epithelial cells and the intensity of crystallization were established. crystallization was determined as an amount of a calcium radioisotope. the chosen strains of uropathogens were able to invade both types of epithelial cells but the hu 609 cells were invaded to a higher extent. however, crystallization occurred only in the presence of p. mirabilis strains which were invasive and urease-positive. the highest intensity of cell-associated crystallization was observed when the number of bacteria within the urothelium remained stable during the time of incubation. these results show that p. mirabilis has an ability to form crystals inside the host cells. under these conditions bacteria are protected from antibiotic killing, which leads to persistent and recurrent infections. we also suspect that this phenomenon may be an important stage of kidney stones formation.

TI  == ceftolozane/tazobactam activity tested against aerobic gram-negative organisms isolated from intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections in european and united states hospitals (2012).
AB  == ceftolozane/tazobactam is under clinical development for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (iai), complicated urinary tract infections (uti) and  ventilator-associated pneumonia. we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator agents tested against gram-negative aerobic bacteria causing iai and healthcare-associated uti (hca-uti). the organisms were  consecutively collected from january to december 2012 from 59 medical centers located in the united states (usa) and 15 european countries by the program to assess ceftolozane/tazobactam susceptibility (pacts). the collection included 809 organisms from iai and 2474 organisms from hca-uti, and susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods as described by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) m07-a9 document. overall, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most  frequently isolated pathogens from both infection types. ceftolozane/tazobactam was very active against e. coli (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 98.5-99.9% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l) and retained activity against many of the multidrug-resistant (mdr; mic50/90, 0.5/2->32 mg/l) and esbl-phenotype strains (mic50/90, 0.5/2-32 mg/l). ceftolozane/tazobactam was active against most k. pneumoniae strains (mic50/90, 0.25/16 mg/l, 88.9-89.6% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l), but some esbl-phenotype (mic50/90, 4-8/>32 mg/l) and mdr (mic50/90, 16/>32 mg/l) isolates exhibited elevated mic values. ceftolozane/tazobactam was the most active agent tested against p. aeruginosa (mic50/90, 0.5/4 mg/l; 93.4-95.7% inhibited at </=8 mg/l) and retained potency against many mdr (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l), ceftazidime-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l) and meropenem-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2/>32 mg/l) strains. ceftolozane/tazobactam was also active against klebsiella oxytoca (mic50/90, </=0.12-0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), enterobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25-0.5/4-8 mg/l), citrobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25/2-32 mg/l), proteus mirabilis (mic50/90, 0.5/0.5 mg/l), indole-positive proteae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), and serratia spp. (mic50/90, 0.5/1-2 mg/l).  in summary, ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity when tested against contemporary aerobic gram-negative pathogens causing iai and hca-uti in usa and european medical centers.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

TI  == towards a receptor-free immobilization and sers detection of urinary tract infections causative pathogens.
AB  == based on molecular-specific surface-enhanced raman scattering (sers) spectroscopy we were able to discriminate between rough and smooth strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis bacteria. for this purpose, bacteria have been immobilized  through electrostatic forces by inducing a positive charge on the glass slide. this way, sers spectra on bacterial biomass and also on single bacteria could be  recorded in less than 2 h, by using concentrated silver nanoparticles as sers-active substrate. single-bacterium sers spectral fingerprints showed to be sensitive to the presence of the o-antigen at strain level and to the microorganisms growth phase. by using principal component analysis (pca) on the sers spectra recorded from e. coli and p. mirabilis, these two uropathogens could be fairly discriminated.

TI  == antibacterial activities and in vitro anti-inflammatory (membrane stability) properties of methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves.
AB  == this work is carried out with gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. the leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. methanol extract from the leaves of gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. the lower concentrations of methanolic leaf extract of gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with kanamycin. the crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of aspirin as positive control. the methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms like streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, and proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. the extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.

TI  == microbiota and anthropic interference on antimicrobial resistance profile of bacteria isolated from brazilian maned-wolf (chrysocyon brachyurus).
AB  == both the study of brazilian wild mammal fauna and the conditions that foster the  preservation of endangered species, such as brazilian maned-wolf (chrysocyon brachyurus), in wild life are of extreme importance. in order to study the resistance profile of microbiota bacterial colonizing brazilian maned-wolf, this  work investigated samples from eight male captive and free roaming animals originating from different brazilian geographical regions. samples for microbiological purposes were collected with swabs and kept in appropriate transport medium. using routine microbiological techniques, the isolated bacteria were tested toward antimicrobial drugs by the agar disk diffusion method. results showed that all samples from wild animals were sensitive toward all drugs tested. conversely, the resistance profile of bacteria isolated from captive animals varied among strains and animal body site location. escherichia coli samples from prepuce, anus and ear showed multi-resistance toward at least four drugs, especially against erythromycin and tetracycline, followed by proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris strains isolated from anus and ear. among gram-positive bacteria, strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci showed multi-resistance mainly toward erythromycin and amoxicillin. the work discusses these findings and suggests that profile of multi-resistance bacteria from captive subjects may be attributed to direct contact with human or through lifestyle factors such as feeding, predation or contact of animals with urban animals such as birds, rodents, and insects from surrounding environments.

TI  == a comparison of inpatient versus outpatient resistance patterns of pediatric urinary tract infection.
AB  == purpose: prior single center studies showed that antibiotic resistance patterns differ between outpatients and inpatients. we compared antibiotic resistance patterns for urinary tract infection between outpatients and inpatients on a national level. materials and methods: we examined outpatient and inpatient urinary isolates from children younger than 18 years using the surveillance network (eurofins scientific, luxembourg, luxembourg), a database of antibiotic susceptibility results, as well as patient demographic data from 195 american hospitals. we determined the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns of the 6 most common uropathogens, including escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella, enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. we compared differences in uropathogen prevalence and resistance patterns for outpatient and  inpatient isolates using chi-square analysis. results: we identified 25,418 outpatient (86% female) and 5,560 inpatient (63% female) urinary isolates. escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen overall but its prevalence varied by gender and visit setting, that is 79% of uropathogens overall for outpatient isolates, including 83% of females and 50% of males, compared to 54% for overall inpatient isolates, including 64% of females and 37% of males (p <0.001). uropathogen resistance to many antibiotics was lower in the outpatient vs inpatient setting, including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 24% vs 30% and cephalothin 16% vs 22% for e. coli (each p <0.001), cephalothin 7% vs 14% for klebsiella (p = 0.03), ceftriaxone 12% vs 24% and ceftazidime 15% vs 33% for enterobacter (each p <0.001), and ampicillin 3% vs 13% and ciprofloxacin 5% vs 12% for enterococcus (each p <0.001). conclusions: uropathogen resistance rates of several antibiotics are higher for urinary specimens obtained from inpatients  vs outpatients. separate outpatient vs inpatient based antibiograms can aid in empirical prescribing for pediatric urinary tract infections.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria.
AB  == background: pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. the disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. pid is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. this situation is not in any way different here in nigeria and more so in the federal capital territory, abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on pid. it therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. materials and methods: endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. results: out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. organisms encountered were  staphylococcus aureus (16%), escherichia coli (10%), streptococcus faecalis (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), streptococcus pyogenes (3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), proteus rettgeri (2%) and proteus mirabilis (1%). the highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). the age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). there was a significant difference in the acquisition of pid in relation to marital status (p < 0.05). however there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (p > 0.05). antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of pid due to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. conclusion: in conclusion, pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. pid is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. there is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. pid hence can be said to be a very serious  complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. the right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation.  treatment of pid should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with pid, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.

TI  == mycosynthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles and their activity against some human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to biosynthesis silver nanoparticles from the fungus nigrospora sphaerica isolated from soil samples and to examine their activity against five human pathogenic strains of bacteria viz. escherichia coli, proteus  mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and staphylococcus aureus using disc diffusion method. the synergistic effect of silver nanoparticles in combination with commonly used antibiotic gentamycin against the selected bacteria was also examined. the synthesized silver nanoparticles from free-cell filtrate were characterized by using uv-vis spectrophotometer analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) and scanning electron microscope (sem). uv-vis spectrophotometer analysis showed a peak at 420 nm indicating the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, ftir analysis verified the detection of protein capping of silver nanoparticles while sem micrographs revealed that the silver nanoparticles are dispersed and aggregated and mostly having spherical shape within the size range between 20 and 70 nm. the synthesized silver nanoparticles exhibited a varied growth inhibition activity (15-26 mm diam inhibition zones) against the tested pathogenic bacteria. a remarkable increase of bacterial growth inhibition (26-34 mm diam) was detected when a combination of silver nanoparticles and gentamycin was used. a significant increase in fold area of antibacterial activity was observed when agnps in combination with gentamycin  was applied. the synthesized silver nanoparticles produced by the fungus n. sphaerica is a promising to be used as safe drug in medical therapy due to their  broad spectrum against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == development of a urinary-specific antibiogram for gram-negative isolates: impact  of patient risk factors on susceptibility.
AB  == background: traditional antibiograms guide clinicians in selecting appropriate empiric antimicrobials, but they lack data on syndrome/disease-specific susceptibility, isolate location, polymicrobial infections, and patient risk factors. the aim of this study was to develop a urinary-specific antibiogram and  to evaluate the impact of risk factors on antimicrobial susceptibility. methods:  this retrospective descriptive study used culture and susceptibility data from january 1 to december 31, 2012. a urinary antibiogram specific for escherichia coli (ec), proteus mirabilis (pm), klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) was developed. urinary and standard antibiogram susceptibilities  were compared. urinary isolates were then stratified by risk factors-residence before admission, age, systemic antimicrobial use for </=30 days, hospitalization for </=30 days, and hospital unit-to determine the impact on antimicrobial susceptibility. results: there were 2,284 urinary isolate encounters. overall antimicrobial susceptibility was increased, and the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates was significantly greater (kp, 14% vs 7% [p = .001]; ec, 13% vs 9% [p < .001]; pm, 18% vs 10% [p = .004]) in the urinary antibiogram vs the standard antibiogram. health care facility residence had the greatest impact on susceptibility for all urinary isolates, especially on fluoroquinolone susceptibility for ec and pm. conclusions: using a  syndromic antibiogram and incorporating patient risk factors into susceptibility  data may be more useful in guiding clinicians in selecting more appropriate empiric therapy.

TI  == in vitro activity of plazomicin against 5,015 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals as part of the canward study, 2011-2012.
AB  == plazomicin is a next-generation aminoglycoside that is not affected by most clinically relevant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. the in vitro activities of  plazomicin and comparator antimicrobials were evaluated against a collection of 5,015 bacterial isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between january 2011 and october 2012. susceptibility testing was performed using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method, with mics interpreted according to clsi breakpoints, when available. plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with all species except proteus mirabilis having an mic90 of  </=1 mug/ml. plazomicin was active against aminoglycoside-nonsusceptible escherichia coli, with mic50 and mic90 values identical to those for aminoglycoside-susceptible isolates. furthermore, plazomicin demonstrated equivalent activities versus extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-esbl-producing e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, with 90% of the isolates inhibited by an mic of </=1 mug/ml. the mic50 and mic90 values for plazomicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa were 4 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively, compared with 4 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively, for amikacin. plazomicin had an mic50 of 8 mug/ml and an mic90 of 32 mug/ml versus 64 multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates. plazomicin was active against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, with both having mic50 and mic90 values of 0.5 mug/ml and 1 mug/ml, respectively. in summary, plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a diverse collection of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci obtained over a large geographic area. these data support further evaluation of plazomicin in the clinical setting.

TI  == therapeutic challenges of esbls and ampc beta-lactamase producers in a tertiary care center.
AB  == background: resistance to broad-spectrum beta lactams mediated by extended spectrum beta lactamases (esbls) and ampc beta lactamases (ampc betals) enzymes is an increasing problem worldwide. determination of their prevalence is essential to formulate an effective antibiotic policy and hospital infection control measures. present study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of esbl and ampc betal producers in icu of a tertiary care center. methods: a total  of 262 clinical isolates comprising of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis that were recovered from various clinical specimens over a  one year period, were studied. antibiogram profile was determined to conventionally used antibiotics, along with recommended tests for detection of esbl and ampc betal production. results: 40.07% (105/262) were found to be esbl producers, 14.8% (39/262) were ampc bl producers. the coexistence of esbl and ampc betal producers was detected in 9.9% (26/262) of the isolates. conclusion: screening of multidrug resistant bacteria especially belonging to the enterobacteriaceae poses considerable therapeutic challenges in critical care patients because of the production of esbl and ampc betal. strategies to keep a check on the emergence of such drug resistant microbes by hospital environmental  surveillance and laboratory monitoring should form an important aspect of hospital infection control policy guidelines.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == objectives: to screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). methods: bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity  tests by the kirby-bauer's disc diffusion method. the antibacterial potentiality  of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of nine uropathogens. results: two gram-positive isolates, e. faecalis and s. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. gram-negative isolates a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. methanolic leaf extracts of anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against s. aureus and 28 mm against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for e. faecalis, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa. based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: c. tora >  a. acuminata > schleichera oleosa > pterocarpus santalinus > eugenia jambolana >  bridelia retusa > mimusops elengi > stereospermum kunthianum > tectona grandis >  anthocephalus cadamba. the following eight plants had moderate control capacity:  artocarpus heterophyllus, azadirachta indica, dalbergia latifolia, eucalyptus citriodora, gmelina arborea, pongamia pinnata, pterocarpus marsupium, and shorea  robusta. e. coli, followed by a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. conclusions: a majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against mdr uropathogenic bacteria.

TI  == the need for culture swabs in laparoscopically treated appendicitis.
AB  == introduction: appendicitis remains the most common cause of an acute abdomen. obtaining intra-abdominal cultures is routine surgical practice. there are studies showing no efficacy of such procedures in cases where open appendectomies are performed. aim: the goal of this study was to assess the need for obtaining intra-abdominal cultures during laparoscopic appendectomies. material and methods: between 2007 and 2012, 369 patients were operated on with the diagnosis  of histopathologically proven acute appendicitis. sixty-two percent of them were  operated on using laparoscopic techniques. the microbiological assessment was routinely done for the open procedures and in 42% of cases that underwent a laparoscopic operation. results: in 57% (134) the swabbing results were negative. among 43% (102) of the patients with a positive result, escherichia coli was isolated in 76.5% (78), proteus mirabilis in 13.7% (14), pseudomonas aeruginosa in 4.9% (5) and citrobacter freundii in 4.9% (5). five cases had bacteria resistant to the antibiotic given preoperatively (that is 4.9% of all positive cultures and 1.4% of all operated patients). however, these cases did not affect  the incidence of postoperative complications. consideration of the postoperative  morbidity showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the laparoscopic group with and without intra-operative swabbing (p > 0.05). conclusions: the postoperative patient outcome was more dependent on the pathology of the appendix than on the results of the microbiological assessment at the time of surgery. hence, routine intra-operative cultures during laparoscopic appendectomies appear to have little value in patient management. swabbing during laparoscopic procedures should be limited to only selected high-risk groups.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of isolates from paediatric intensive care units in zagreb.
AB  == aim: meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program is a longitudinal global surveillance study to monitor in vitro data on microbial susceptibility in centers that prescribe meropenem. results of the six years period (2002-2007) for the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other  broad-spectrum agents against gram-negative and gram-positive isolates collected  at pediatric intensive care units of the university hospital center zagreb in croatia were reported. methods: a total of 110 gram-negative and 43 gram-positive pathogens from pediatric specimens were tested. the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution method according to  clsi. results: there was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. high resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and gentamicin (50%) are a raising concern. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant gram-negative species with two (12%) of the strains resistant to meropenem, three (18%) to imipenem, 10 (47%) to gentamicin and six (35%) to piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. according to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-negative bacteria in pediatric population. conclusions: the results indicate that meropenem has excellent potency and spectrum of activity despite being prescribed for a long time for the treatment of seriously ill patients, and still appears to be a reliable option for the initial empirical therapy of serious nosocomial infections in children. however, later studies have shown the emergence of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria after 2008.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative organisms isolated from patients hospitalized in intensive care units in united states and european hospitals (2009-2011).
AB  == treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (icu) represents a great challenge, especially those caused by gram-negative organisms. rapid introduction of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial to reduce mortality; resistance rates in the icu can be elevated due to antimicrobial selection pressure. we evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients hospitalized in icus (icu patients). the isolates were consecutively collected as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program  from january 2009 to december 2011 and tested for susceptibility to multiple antimicrobial agents at a central laboratory by reference broth microdilution methods. antimicrobial susceptibility results for 5989 bacterial isolates from icu patients (3445 from the united states [usa] and 2544 from europe [eu]) were analyzed and compared to those of 17,244 organisms from non-icu patients (9271 from usa and 7973 from eu). escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated organisms from icu patients, followed by enterobacter spp., serratia spp., haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., and proteus mirabilis. susceptibility rates were generally lower among icu isolates compared to non-icu organisms. e. coli isolates from icu patients exhibited elevated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-phenotype rates (13.7% in usa and 16.6% in eu); furthermore, only amikacin (90.5-94.8% susceptibility), colistin (99.8-100.0% inhibited at </=2 mug/ml), imipenem (95.5-96.0%), meropenem (95.4-95.8%), and tigecycline (96.3-98.0%) exhibited good activity against klebsiella spp. esbl-phenotype rates have increased among both e. coli and klebsiella spp. from icu patients in the usa and in europe, with the  most noticeable increase among klebsiella spp. from europe (from 27.5% in 2009 to 41.8% in 2011; p = 0.015 and odds ratio = 0.89 [95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.18]). meropenem susceptibility among klebsiella spp. improved slightly in  the usa but decreased markedly in europe from 100.0% in 2009 to 89.7% in 2011. only colistin (99.4% susceptible) and amikacin (97.3% in usa and 84.9% in eu) exhibited good activity against p. aeruginosa strains from icu patients. the greatest differences in susceptibility rates between p. aeruginosa strains from icu and non-icu patients were observed for the anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams, such as ceftazidime, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam. the results of this  study (101 medical centers) highlight major antimicrobial coverage problems and trends in antimicrobial resistance for usa and eu icu patient isolates.

TI  == recommendations for the empirical treatment of complicated urinary tract infections using surveillance data on antimicrobial resistance in the netherlands.
AB  == background: complicated urinary tract infections (c-utis) are among the most common nosocomial infections and a substantial part of the antimicrobial agents used in hospitals is for the treatment of c-utis. data from surveillance can be used to guide the empirical treatment choices of clinicians when treating c-utis. we therefore used nation-wide surveillance data to evaluate antimicrobial coverage of agents for the treatment of c-uti in the netherlands. methods: we included the first isolate per patient of urine samples of hospitalised patients  collected by the infectious disease surveillance information system for antibiotic resistance (isis-ar) in 2012, and determined the probability of inadequate coverage for antimicrobial agents based on species distribution and susceptibility. analyses were repeated for various patient groups and hospital settings. results: the most prevalent bacteria in 27,922 isolates of 23,357 patients were escherichia coli (47%), enterococcus spp. (14%), proteus mirabilis  (8%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (7%). for all species combined, the probability of inadequate coverage was <5% for amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combined with gentamicin and the carbapenems. when including gram-negative bacteria only, the probability of inadequate coverage was 4.0%, 2.7%, 2.3% and 1.7%, respectively, for amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, a second or a third generation cephalosporin in combination with gentamicin, and the carbapenems (0.4%). there were only small variations in results among different patient groups and hospital settings. conclusions: when excluding enterococcus spp., considered as less virulent, and the carbapenems, considered as last-resort drugs, empirical treatment for c-uti with the best chance of adequate coverage are one of the studied beta-lactam-gentamicin combinations. this study demonstrates the applicability of routine surveillance data for up-to-date clinical practice guidelines on empirical antimicrobial therapy, essential in patient care given the evolving bacterial susceptibility.

TI  == [one-year surveillance study of antimicrobial resistance in major bacteria except for mrsa isolated in eight medical facilities in kumamoto prefecture].
AB  == to investigate the current status of drug-resistant bacteria (except mrsa) in kumamoto prefecture, a study was conducted to determine the isolation numbers and ratios of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-escherichia coli, esbl-klebsiella species, esbl-proteus mirabilis, two-drug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, (resistant to two drugs either carbapenems, quinolones and aminoglycosides) multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, multi-drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, and vancomyacin-resistant enterococcii in eight general hospitals from may in 2009 to april in 2010. esbl-e. coli was mostly isolated, and two-drug resistant p. aeruginosa came second. the isolation ratio of overall drug-resistant bacteria did not increase,  while the isolation ratio of two-drugs resistant p. aeruginosa declined, suggesting that infection control was successfully conducted in these hospitals.  however, the isolation numbers of esbl-klebsiella spp. and two-drug resistant p.  aeruginosa were variable in each hospital. furthermore, drug-resistant bacteria were occasionally spread into another medical facilities by patients transferred  from these hospitals, indicating that sharing information on drug-resistant bacteria between medical facilities is required.

TI  == evaluation of the clinical and laboratory standards institute phenotypic confirmatory test to detect the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from 4005 escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis isolates.
AB  == a subset of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis isolates collected for the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends that were positive for the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypic confirmatory  test (n = 3245) or had an ertapenem mic of >/=0.5 microg ml(-1) (n = 293), or both (n = 467), were analysed for esbl genes. most esbl phenotype e. coli or k. pneumoniae possessed an esbl gene (95.8 and 88.4 %, respectively), and this was 93.1 % if carbapenem-non-susceptible k. pneumoniae were removed. this rate was lower for p. mirabilis (73.4 %) and k. oxytoca (62.5 %). virtually all esbl-positive isolates (99.5 %) were cefotaxime non-susceptible [clsi or european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints)]. fewer isolates (82 %) were ceftazidime non-susceptible (clsi breakpoints). in addition, 21.1 % of e. coli, 25 % of k. oxytoca and 78.7 % of p. mirabilis isolates were ceftazidime susceptible but esbl positive. this suggests that clsi breakpoints for ceftazidime are too high to detect esbls. the lower eucast breakpoints detected esbls in e. coli and k. oxytoca better, but 59.6 % of esbl-positive isolates of p. mirabilis were ceftazidime susceptible. for isolates with ertapenem mics >/=0.5 microg ml(-1), more accurate esbl phenotype analysis was observed for e. coli and k. pneumoniae (sensitivity >95 % for both, specificity 94.4 and 54.1 %, respectively). if carbapenemase-positive k. pneumoniae were excluded, the specificity increased to 78 %. the positive predictive values for the esbl phenotypic test with e. coli and k. pneumoniae were 97.6 and 81.8 %, respectively, and negative predictive values were 75.9 and 95.2 %, respectively.  we therefore suggest that it would be prudent to confirm phenotypic esbl-positive p. mirabilis, k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca with molecular analysis.

TI  == diafiltration maldi-tof mass spectrometry method for culture-independent detection and identification of pathogens directly from urine specimens.
AB  == objectives: with the aim of rapid, culture-independent identification of microorganisms directly from urine specimens, we developed a diafiltration matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) method. methods: in this procedure, urine specimens are desalted,  fractionated, and concentrated prior to ms analysis. the analytic performance characteristics of the diafiltration method were assessed in a prospective trial  whereby 100 fresh urine specimens were processed using diafiltration maldi-tof ms. concomitant with this, conventional culture was performed with results blinded to the ms operator. results: the diafiltration method correctly identified urine specimens positive for uropathogens (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis) and correctly classified all specimens negative for clinically relevant bacteriuria, including a subset of contaminated urine specimens and a subset with growth of clinically insignificant flora. the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 67% and 100%, respectively. the detection limit of this method was 10(5) to 10(6) colony-forming units/ml. conclusions: using the diafiltration method, we were able to improve the turnaround time for microorganism identification from 24 to 48 hours (for conventional culture) to 2 to 3 hours. although methodological refinements are under way to further improve the clinical sensitivity and turnaround time, the 100% positive predictive value of this method suggests that  it could be used to guide the selection of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of geranium oil against gram-negative bacteria isolated from difficult-to-heal wounds.
AB  == hard-to-heal wounds represent a significant problem to patients, health care professionals, and health care system. they can be formed as a result of mechanical injuries and burns, and any co-existing chronic disease increases the  risk of their emergence. diabetics are at a greater risk of developing chronic wounds because of poor circulation, slow healing times, vascular disease and neuropathy. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of  geranium oil against gram-negative bacterial clinical strains. clinical strains were isolated from patients with difficult-to-treat wounds and a comprehensive evaluation of their sensitivity to antibiotics was carried out. the constituents  of geranium oil were specified by gc-fid-ms analysis. the micro-dilution broth method was used to check the inhibition of microbial growth at various concentrations of geranium oil. the tested geranium oil was efficacious against gram-negative pathogens responsible for problems with wound treatment. the results suggest that geranium oil may be considered an effective component of therapy in the case of frequent recurrences of infections caused by resistant pathogens.

AB  == pineapple leaf was used in this study for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles based on the search for sustainable synthetic means. indeed, this offered an economical and sustainable synthetic route relative to expensive and toxic chemical methods. the leaf extract was used and the corresponding nanoparticles obtained were subjected to uv-vis analysis at different times. the uv-vis was used to monitor the silver nanoparticle formation through sampling at time intervals. the formation of silver nanoparticles was apparently displayed within  2 min with evidence of surface plasmon bands (spb) between 440 and 460 nm. the crystals was equally characterized using ftir, x-ray diffraction methods and tem. the different results obtained suggested the appearance of silver nanoparticles (snps) as determined by the process parameters with a particle size of 12.4 nm. the sample was further screened against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli using gentamicin as control. from the results, there is evidence of inhibition towards bacteria growth. it can now be inferred from the studies that biosynthesis of nanoparticles could be a gateway to our numerous health issues.

TI  == inhibition of biofilm development of uropathogens by curcumin - an anti-quorum sensing agent from curcuma longa.
AB  == urinary tract infection is caused primarily by the quorum sensing (qs)-dependent  biofilm forming ability of uropathogens. in the present investigation, an anti-quorum sensing (anti-qs) agent curcumin from curcuma longa (turmeric) was shown to inhibit the biofilm formation of uropathogens, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens, possibly  by interfering with their qs systems. the antibiofilm potential of curcumin on uropathogens as well as its efficacy in disturbing the mature biofilms was examined under light microscope and confocal laser scanning microscope. the treatment with curcumin was also found to attenuate the qs-dependent factors, such as exopolysaccharide production, alginate production, swimming and swarming  motility of uropathogens. furthermore, it was documented that curcumin enhanced the susceptibility of a marker strain and uropathogens to conventional antibiotics.

TI  == [etiologic and antibiotic susceptibility profile of the first episode of febrile  urinary tract infection].
AB  == background: urinary tract infection (uti) is a common infection in childhood; its diagnosis involves performing a urine culture. aim: to describe the etiology and  bacterial susceptibility of the first episode of uti in children presenting with  fever to the emergency room. patients and methods: one hundred and five children  (2 months -5 years old) seen at the hospital dr. sotero del rio in santiago, between november 2009 and november 2010 were evaluated. a urine specimen was obtained by transurethral catheterization. urine was cultured and microorganisms  were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. results: 76.2% (80)  of patients were women and 80% (84) were under 18 months. urine sediment was abnormal in 82.5%. the most frequently isolated microorganism was escherichia coli (96.1%) showing high susceptibility to aminoglycosides (near 100%), third generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin; and low susceptibility to cephalothin (69%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66%). we found one esbl-producing strain. conclusion: the most common uropathogen was e. coli with good in vitro susceptibility to aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins, which are the recommended initial empirical therapy. e. coli esbl-producing strains appear as emerging pathogens in community acquired utis in children.

TI  == contemporary diversity of beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae in the nine u.s. census regions and ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against isolates producing the most prevalent beta-lactamase groups.
AB  == escherichia coli (328 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (296), klebsiella oxytoca  (44), and proteus mirabilis (33) isolates collected during 2012 from the nine u.s. census regions and displaying extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypes were evaluated for the presence of beta-lactamase genes, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were analyzed. the highest esbl rates were  noted for k. pneumoniae (16.0%, versus 4.8 to 11.9% for the other species) and in the mid-atlantic and west south central census regions. ctx-m group 1 (including  ctx-m-15) was detected in 303 strains and was widespread throughout the united states but was more prevalent in the west south central, mid-atlantic, and east north central regions. kpc producers (118 strains [112 k. pneumoniae strains]) were detected in all regions and were most frequent in the mid-atlantic region (58 strains). thirteen kpc producers also carried blactx-m. shv genes encoding esbl activity were detected among 176 isolates. other beta-lactamase genes observed were ctx-m group 9 (72 isolates), fox (10), tem esbl (9), dha (7), ctx-m group 2 (3), ndm-1 (2 [colorado]), and ctx-m groups 8 and 25 (1). additionally, 62.9% of isolates carried >/=2 beta-lactamase genes. kpc producers were highly resistant to multiple agents, but ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml)  and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml) were the most active agents tested. overall, meropenem (mic50, </=0.06 mug/ml), ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50, 0.12 to 0.5 mug/ml), and tigecycline (mic50, 0.12 to 2 mug/ml) were the most active antimicrobials when tested against this collection. ndm-1 producers were resistant to all beta-lactams tested. the diversity and increasing prevalence of  beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae have been documented, and ceftazidime-avibactam was very active against the vast majority of beta-lactamase-producing strains isolated from u.s. hospitals.

TI  == risk factors of community-onset urinary tract infections caused by plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: the ampc beta-lactamase (ampc)-producing enterobacteriaceae emerged worldwide. this study was conducted to determine the risk factors of community-onset urinary tract infections (utis) caused by plasmid-mediated ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae. methods: patients who were diagnosed as community-onset utis caused by enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary-care teaching hospital from december 2010 to january 2012 were included. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates were excluded. we identified plasmid-mediated ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae both phenotypically (by disk potentiation test and double-disk synergy test) and genotypically (by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay). the demographic data, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of acquisition were described. results: among the 323 non-esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae identified in community-onset utis, 50 isolates were phenotypically positive for ampc. escherichia coli was the most  common ampc-producing organism (60%), followed by klebsiella pneumonia (8%), and  enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (6% for each species). the independent risk factors for acquisition of ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae included prior  history of cerebral vascular accident [odds ratio (or) = 2.014; 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.007-4.031; p = 0.0048], and prior use of fluoroquinolones (or = 4.049; 95% ci = 1.759-9.319; p = 0.001) and cephamycin (or = 9.683; 95% ci = 2.007-45.135; p = 0.004). ampc-producing isolates were multidrug resistant. carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam had the best in vitro efficacy. the most commonly identified plasmid-mediated ampc gene was blacit, followed by bladha/blaebc, and blamox. conclusion: for community-onset utis, ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae should be suspected in those with prior history of cerebral vascular accident and prior use of antimicrobials. to treat these multiple-resistant isolates, carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam may be considered.

TI  == urinary concentrations and antibacterial activities of nitroxoline at 250 milligrams versus trimethoprim at 200 milligrams against uropathogens in healthy  volunteers.
AB  == because of the increasing bacterial resistance of uropathogens against standard antibiotics, such as trimethoprim (tmp), older antimicrobial drugs, such as nitroxoline (ntx), should be reevaluated. this randomized crossover study investigated the urinary concentrations of parent drugs and their metabolites and their antibacterial activities (urinary inhibitory titers [uits] and urinary bactericidal titers [ubts]) against uropathogens at three different urinary ph values within 24 h in six healthy volunteers after a single oral dose of ntx at 250 mg versus tmp at 200 mg. in three additional volunteers, urinary bactericidal kinetics (ubk) were studied after oral administration of ntx at 250 mg three times a day. the mean urinary concentrations of ntx and ntx sulfate in 24 h were  0.012 to 0.507 mg/liter and 0.28 to 27.83 mg/liter, respectively. the mean urinary concentrations of tmp were 18.79 to 41.59 mg/liter. the antibacterial activity of ntx was higher in acidic urine than in alkaline urine, and that of tmp was higher in alkaline urine than in acidic urine. the uits and ubts of ntx were generally lower than those of tmp except for a tmp-resistant escherichia coli strain, for which ntx showed higher uits/ubts than did tmp. ubk showed mainly bacteriostatic activity of ntx in urine. ntx exhibits mainly bacteriostatic activity and tmp also shows bactericidal activity in urine against susceptible strains. ntx is a more active antibacterial in acidic urine, and tmp  is more active in alkaline urine. the cumulative effects of multiple doses or inhibition of bacterial adherence could not be evaluated.

TI  == fosfomycin trometamol: a review of its use as a single-dose oral treatment for patients with acute lower urinary tract infections and pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria.
AB  == fosfomycin trometamol (fosfomycin tromethamine) [monuril((r)), monurol((r)), monural((r))] is approved in numerous countries worldwide, mainly for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). fosfomycin has good in vitro activity against common uropathogens, such as escherichia coli (including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli), proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus saprophyticus, and the susceptibility of uropathogens to fosfomycin has remained relatively stable over  time. a single oral dose of fosfomycin trometamol 3 g (the approved dosage) achieves high concentrations in urine. results of recent randomized trials indicate that single-dose fosfomycin trometamol had similar clinical and/or bacteriological efficacy to 3- to 7-day regimens of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, cotrimoxazole or nitrofurantoin in women with uncomplicated lower utis. in addition, single-dose fosfomycin trometamol had similar bacteriological efficacy  to a 5-day course of cefuroxime axetil or a 7-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, and  similar clinical and/or bacteriological efficacy to a 5-day course of cefuroxime  axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or a 3-day course of ceftibuten in pregnant women with a lower uti. single-dose fosfomycin trometamol was generally well tolerated, with gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea, nausea) reported most commonly. in conclusion, single-dose fosfomycin trometamol is an important option for the first-line empirical treatment of uncomplicated lower utis.

TI  == bioconversion of l-glutamic acid to alpha-ketoglutaric acid by an immobilized whole-cell biocatalyst expressing l-amino acid deaminase from proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the goal of this work was to develop an immobilized whole-cell biocatalytic process for the environment-friendly synthesis of alpha-ketoglutaric acid (alpha-kg) from l-glutamic acid. we compared the suitability of escherichia coli  and bacillus subtilis strains overexpressing proteus mirabilisl-amino acid deaminase (l-aad) as potential biocatalysts. although both recombinant strains were biocatalytically active, the performance of b. subtilis was superior to that of e. coli. with l-glutamic acid as the substrate, alpha-kg production levels by  membranes isolated from b. subtilis and e. coli were 55.3+/-1.73 and 21.7+/-0.39mug/mg protein/min, respectively. the maximal conversion ratio of l-glutamic acid to alpha-kg was 31% (w/w) under the following optimal conditions: 15g/l l-glutamic acid, 20g/l whole-cell biocatalyst, 5mm mgcl2, 40 degrees c, ph  8.0, and 24-h incubation. immobilization of whole cells with alginate increased the recyclability by an average of 23.33% per cycle. this work established an efficient one-step biotransformation process for the production of alpha-kg using immobilized whole b. subtilis overexpressing p. mirabilisl-aad. compared with traditional multistep chemical synthesis, the biocatalytic process described here has the advantage of reducing environmental pollution and thus has great potential for the large-scale production of alpha-kg.

TI  == avibactam reverts the ceftazidime mic90 of european gram-negative bacterial clinical isolates to the epidemiological cut-off value.
AB  == objectives: ceftazidime-avibactam consists of the beta-lactam ceftazidime and the novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam. the effect of avibactam on the ceftazidime mic frequency distribution of gram-negative european clinical  isolates was observed and compared to european committee for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) mic frequency distributions and epidemiological cut-off values (ecoffs) listed for ceftazidime. methods: ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam mics were determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) reference broth microdilution methods for pseudomonas  aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., serratia spp., enterobacter spp.,  and proteus mirabilis isolates collected from medical centres in europe during 2009. results: the mic(90) values for ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam against p. aeruginosa isolates from a 2009 european surveillance programme were >32 and 8 mg/l, respectively. that is, the presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime mic(90) for p. aeruginosa to the ecoff. similarly, the mic(90) values for ceftazidime against e. coli, klebsiella spp., serratia spp., and p. mirabilis were also reduced to the ecoff by the presence of avibactam. avibactam reduced the ceftazidime mic(90) value against collected enterobacter spp. to 1 mg/l (>32-fold reduction). no ecoff has been defined for enterobacter spp. however, it is 1 mg/l for enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae. conclusions: the presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime mic(90) for gram-negative bacteria to the ecoff.

TI  == autocatalytic growth of biofunctionalized antibacterial silver nanoparticles.
AB  == development of eco-friendly processes for nanosynthesis is gaining importance owing to the widespread application of nanoparticles (nps). in the present study, we have explained the mechanism and kinetics of bioreduction in the biosynthesis  of silver nanoparticles (agnps) using aqueous leaf extract of rhizophora apiculata. spectrophotometric methods were employed to quantify the bioactive molecules present before and after the reduction process. the results showed that the polyphenols were the main components responsible for the biosynthesis of agnps, which was further confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. the kinetics of formation of agnps were monitored by time-resolved spectrophotometric and x-ray diffraction studies, which revealed that the np formation is an autocatalytic process with a rate constant of 1.9 x 10(-2) min(-1) . the nps were characterized using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques like ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. the biogenic agnps showed substantial inhibitory activity to proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus with minimum  inhibitory concentration values of 2.5, 12.5, 2.5, and 31.25 mug/ml, respectively. the current research provides an insight into the mechanistic aspects of bioreduction and formation of agnps.

TI  == arginine oscillation explains na+ independence in the substrate/product antiporter cait.
AB  == most secondary-active transporters transport their substrates using an electrochemical ion gradient. in contrast, the carnitine transporter (cait) is an ion-independent, l-carnitine/gamma-butyrobetaine antiporter belonging to the betaine/carnitine/choline transporter family of secondary transporters. recently  determined crystal structures of cait from escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis revealed an inverted five-transmembrane-helix repeat similar to that in the amino acid/na(+) symporter leut. the ion independence of cait makes it unique in this family. here we show that mutations of arginine 262 (r262) make cait na(+)-dependent. the transport activity of r262 mutants increased by 30-40% in the presence of a membrane potential, indicating substrate/na(+) cotransport. structural and biochemical characterization revealed that r262 plays a crucial role in substrate binding by stabilizing the partly unwound tm1' helix. modeling  cait from p. mirabilis in the outward-open and closed states on the corresponding structures of the related symporter betp reveals alternating orientations of the  buried r262 sidechain, which mimic sodium binding and unbinding in the na(+)-coupled substrate symporters. we propose that a similar mechanism is operative in other na(+)/h(+)-independent transporters, in which a positively charged amino acid replaces the cotransported cation. the oscillation of the r262 sidechain in cait indicates how a positive charge triggers the change between outward-open and inward-open conformations as a unifying critical step in leut-type transporters.

TI  == frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteremia isolates in patients with urinary tract infection: results from united states and european hospitals (2009-2011).
AB  == we evaluated the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of gram-negative bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients with uti from european (eu) and united states (usa) hospitals during a 3-year period (2009-2011). susceptibility testing was performed by the reference broth microdilution method on 2071 gram-negative bacilli. the most frequently isolated  pathogens were escherichia coli (63.3/71.3% in usa/eu), klebsiella spp. (16.7/11.2%) and proteus mirabilis (6.4/5.0%). escherichia coli susceptibility rates were generally similar in the usa and eu, with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-phenotype rates at 8.1% in both regions. among klebsiella spp., esbl rates varied from 11.4/17.1% in 2009 to 16.1/40.4% in 2011 in usa/eu,  and susceptibility rates were generally lower in eu compared to the usa. pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited lower susceptibility rates to ceftazidime, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam in eu (78.4, 78.4 and 76.5%, respectively)  compared to usa (91.2, 88.2 and 91.2%, respectively). in summary, very few antimicrobials provided satisfactory coverage (>90%) when tested against klebsiella spp. and p. aeruginosa isolates in eu.

AB  == we have investigated the immune response to commensal bacterial species in the two inbred rat strains: dark agouti (da) and albino oxford (ao). the predominant  gram-negative aerobe in our rats' intestinal bacterial flora was escherichia coli, while proteus mirabilis was isolated only from da rat strain. we report that sera from both da and ao rat strains contain specific igg against predominant intestinal flora. intramuscular administration of commensal bacterial antigens provoked only th1-type antibody response in ao rats while da rats developed mixed th1- and th2-type antibody response to e. coli and th1-type response to p. mirabilis antigens. weaker antibody production to own e. coli and  higher serum levels of natural igg and iga p. mirabilis-specific antibodies combined with higher cd3+ cells proliferation was found in ao rats. strain difference in the pattern of antibody production and differential regulation of immune response to commensal bacteria may contribute to the marked differences in the immune reactivity of ao and da rats.

TI  == increased serum procalcitonin levels in pregnant patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria.
AB  == background: among the pregnancy urinary tract infections, asymptomatic bacteriuria (asb) is the most common one. untreated asb can progress to pyelonephritis in 30-50% of the patients and can also result in prematurity in 27% of the pregnancy so it needs immediate diagnosis and treatment. in this study, we wanted to evaluate procalcitonin levels, compared to other inflammatory in pregnant women with asb. methods: the study was designed between the period of january 2012 and february 2013 at sakarya university school of medicine, department of gynecology and obstetrics. the study population included 30 pregnant patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria and 39 healthy pregnant controls. results: mean age was 28 (sd, 5.5) of the study population; mean maternal weight  was 70 (sd, 8) kilogram. there were no statically significant differences between the groups according to the routine biochemical parameters, but gestational age was significantly lower in the asb group compared to the controls (20.4 vs 28.6,  respectively; p < 0.001). serum procalcitonin levels were negative in all of the  controls. in asb group, 9 (30%) patients had procalcitonin levels greater than >0.05 ng/ml and 21(70%) patients had negative procalcitonin levels (chi-squrae, p < 0.001). the sensitivity and specificity of procalcitonin assay for asb was calculated as 30% and 100%, respectively. the positive predictive value was 100%  and the negative predictive value was 65%. the most frequent microorganisms in the urine culture were escherichia coli (26 patients, 87%), proteus mirabilis (3  patients, 10%) and klebsiella (1 patient, 3%) in the asb group. we experienced four (44%) recurrences among nine positive procalcitonin in asb patients after completion of treatment of the first asb diagnosis. discussion: procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in asb group than the control group and serum procalcitonin levels were higher in pregnant women with recurrent asb. this finding is an important result revealed that high procalcitonin level can predict the further urinary tract infection risk. finally, serum procalcitonin levels were normal in healthy pregnant women while other inflammatory markers such as wbc, esr and crp levels were higher.

AB  == glutathione s-transferases (gsts) are a family of multifunctional proteins playing important roles in detoxification of harmful physiological and xenobiotic compounds in organisms. in our study, a gene encoding a gst from proteus mirabilis strain v7, gstpm-4, was cloned and conditionally expressed in escherichia coli strain bl21(de3). the purified gstpm-4 protein, with an estimated molecular mass of approximately 23kda, was able to conjugate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and bind to the gsh-affinity matrix. real-time reverse transcriptase pcr suggested that mrna level of gstpm-4 was increased in the presence of cdcl2, cucl2, hgcl2 and pbcl2, respectively. correspondingly, overexpression of gstpm-4 in the genetically engineered bacterium top10/placpgst  exhibited higher heavy metal resistance compared to the control top10/placp3. another genetically engineered bacterium top10/pbatgst, in which the dna encoding gstpm-4 protein was fused with the dna encoding pfa1-based auto surface display system, was built. top10/pbatgst could constitutively express the chimeric gstpm-4 and anchor it onto the cell surface subsequently. almost 100% of the hg(2+) within the range of 0.1-100 nm was adsorbed by top10/pbatgst, and 80% of the bounded hg(2+) could be desorbed from bacterial cells when ph was adjusted to 6.0. thus, top10/pbatgst can be potentially used for efficient treatment of hg(2+)-contaminated aquatic environment.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == relationship between the distribution of cefepime minimum inhibitory concentrations and detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production among clinically important enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from patients in intensive care units in taiwan: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart) in 2007.
AB  == background: the data on susceptibility of important cephalosporins against four enterobacteriaceae members producing potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) collected from taiwanese intensive care units are lacking. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime were determined using agar dilution method, against escherichia coli (n = 344), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 359), enterobacter cloacae (n = 103), and proteus mirabilis (n = 78). susceptibilities of these isolates to three cephalosporins were assessed according to mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) in 2013. the double-disk synergy test using disks containing cefepime (30 mug) with or without clavulanate (10 mug) was applied to  confirm production of esbl for isolates with cephalosporin mic >/= 2 mug/ml. results: a total of 175 isolates were verified as esbl producers. the rates of cefepime susceptibility among the esbl-producing isolates, according to clsi (eucast) criteria, were 56.7% (22.4%) for e. coli, 61.3% (12.0%) for k. pneumoniae, 57.9% (31.6%) for e. cloacae, and 71.4% (7.1%) for p. mirabilis. using different cefepime mic breakpoints (mics >/= 16 mug/ml recommended by clsi  criteria and >/= 2 mug/ml by eucast criteria) to define nonsusceptibility, we found that both criteria were poorer at predicting esbl producers among k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae than among the other two species. in addition, we also  found that the cefepime mic level of 1.0 mug/ml best distinguished non-esbl- from esbl-producing k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae. conclusion: to detect esbls, clsi should revise the cefepime mic breakpoint against enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == high prevalence of fecal carriage of extended spectrum beta-lactamase/ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae in cats and dogs.
AB  == extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)/ampc producing enterobacteriaceae have been reported worldwide amongst isolates obtained from humans, food-producing animals, companion animals, and environmental sources. however, data on prevalence of fecal carriage of esbl/ampc producing enterobacteriaceae in healthy companion animals is limited. this pilot study describes the prevalence of esbl/ampc encoding genes in healthy cats and dogs, and cats and dogs with diarrhea. twenty fecal samples of each group were cultured on macconkey agar supplemented with 1 mg/l cefotaxime and in lb-enrichment broth supplemented with  1 mg/l cefotaxime, which was subsequently inoculated on macconkey agar supplemented with 1 mg/l cefotaxime. esbl/ampc genes were identified using the check-points ct103 micro array kit and subsequently by sequencing analysis. chromosomal ampc promoter mutations were detected by pcr and sequencing analysis. from the healthy and diarrheic dogs, respectively 45 and 55% were positive for escherichia coli with reduced susceptibility for cefotaxime. from the healthy and diarrheic cats, the estimated prevalence was respectively 0 and 25%. one diarrheic cat was positive for both reduced susceptible e. coli and proteus mirabilis. the esbl/ampc genes found in this study were mainly bla ctx-m-1, but also bla ctx-m-14, bla ctx-m-15, bla tem-52-stpaul, bla shv-12, and bla cmy-2 were detected. this pilot study showed that the prevalence of esbl/ampc producing enterobacteriaceae in healthy and diarrheic dogs, and diarrheic cats was relatively high. furthermore, the genes found were similar to those found in isolates of both human and food-producing animal origin. however, since the size  of this study was relatively small, extrapolation of the data to the general population of cats and dogs should be done with great care.

TI  == deep wound infections after spinal fusion in children with cerebral palsy: a prospective cohort study.
AB  == study design: prospective cohort. objective: to (1) calculate the rate of deep wound infection in children with cerebral palsy (cp) after spinal fusion surgery; (2) identify factors (patient, laboratory, and surgical) associated with deep wound infection development; and (3) report causative organisms. summary of background data: wound infection after spine fusion for cp is more common than after spine fusion for most other diagnoses. methods: we prospectively gathered data on 204 consecutive pediatric patients with cp who underwent surgery at 7 institutions. univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed to analyze patient, laboratory, and surgical characteristics to identify factors that were significantly associated with infection development. statistical significance was set at a value of p less than 0.05. results: deep wound infection developed in 13 (6.4%) children. the mean time to infection development was 34.2 +/- 60.2 days. on univariate analysis, older age, larger curve size, presence of gastrostomy/gastrojejunostomy tube, higher preoperative serum white blood cell count, and longer operative time were significantly associated with deep wound infection. on multivariate analysis, only the presence of a gastrostomy/gastrojejunostomy tube remained significant (1.9-fold risk of deep wound infection compared with patients without tubes). escherichia coli was the most common organism cultured from the wound sites (5 patients). other infective  agents were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (1), proteus mirabilis (1), and polymicrobial organisms (4). conclusion: deep wound infection occurred in 6.4% of children with cp after spinal fusion. the presence of a gastrostomy/gastrojejunostomy tube was a significant predictor  of infection. gram-negative organisms were the most common causative agents. surgeons should be cognizant of these factors when treating children with cp and  may consider gram-negative antibiotic prophylaxis.

TI  == monoclonal antibodies directed against the outer membrane protein of bordetella avium.
AB  == bordetella avium is the etiologic agent of coryza and rhinotracheitis in poultry. this respiratory disease is responsible for substantial economic losses in the poultry industry. monoclonal antibodies (mabs) were produced against the outer membrane proteins (omps) of b. avium isolated from diseased chickens. balb/c mice were immunized with the extracted b. avium omps. then the splenocytes from immunized mice and sp2/0 myeloma cells were fused using peg 4000. three stable hybridoma clones (designated as 3g(1)(0), 4a(3), and 4e(8)) were produced via indirect elisa and three rounds of subcloning. the mabs were classified as igg1,  and can recognize the 58 kda omp band by western blot assays. no mab cross-reactivity with chicken proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and salmonella was observed. a double antibody sandwich elisa (das-elisa) was developed using the rabbit polyclonal antibodies as the capture antibody and mab 4a(3) as the detection antibody. under the das-elisa, the minimum detectable concentration of  b. avium was 1 x 10(4) cfu/ml, and no cross-reactivity occurred with chicken proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and salmonella. results showed that the das-elisa has good sensitivity and specificity. clinical application showed the das-elisa was more sensitive than the plate agglutination test. this study may be used to develop a quick and specific diagnostic kit, analyze epitopes, and establish systems for typing b. avium.

TI  == class d beta-lactamases: a reappraisal after five decades.
AB  == despite 70 years of clinical use, beta-lactam antibiotics still remain at the forefront of antimicrobial chemotherapy. the major challenge to these life-saving therapeutics is the presence of bacterial enzymes (i.e., beta-lactamases) that can hydrolyze the beta-lactam bond and inactivate the antibiotic. these enzymes can be grouped into four classes (a-d). among the most genetically diverse are the class d beta-lactamases. in this class are beta-lactamases that can inactivate the entire spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems). class d beta-lactamases are mostly found in gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa , escherichia coli , proteus mirabilis , and acinetobacter baumannii . the active-sites of class d beta-lactamases contain an unusual n-carboxylated lysine post-translational modification. a strongly hydrophobic active-site helps create the conditions that allow the lysine to combine with co2, and the resulting carbamate is stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds. the carboxy-lysine plays a symmetric role in the reaction, serving as a general base to activate the serine nucleophile in the acylation reaction, and the deacylating water in the second step. there are more  than 250 class d beta-lactamases described, and the full set of variants shows remarkable diversity with regard to substrate binding and turnover. narrow-spectrum variants are most effective against the earliest generation penicillins and cephalosporins such as ampicillin and cephalothin. extended-spectrum variants (also known as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, esbls) pose a more dangerous clinical threat as they possess a small number of substitutions that allow them to bind and hydrolyze later generation cephalosporins that contain bulkier side-chain constituents (e.g., cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime). mutations that permit this versatility seem to cluster in the area surrounding an active-site tryptophan resulting in a widened  active-site to accommodate the oxyimino side-chains of these cephalosporins. more concerning are the class d beta-lactamases that hydrolyze clinically important carbapenem beta-lactam drugs (e.g., imipenem). whereas carbapenems irreversibly acylate and inhibit narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases, class d carbapenemases are able to recruit and activate a deacylating water. the rotational orientation of the c6 hydroxyethyl group found on all carbapenem antibiotics likely plays a role in whether the deacylating water is effective or not. inhibition of class d beta-lactamases is a current challenge. commercially available inhibitors that are active against other classes of beta-lactamases are ineffective against class d enzymes. on the horizon are several compounds, consisting of both beta-lactam derivatives and non-beta-lactams, that have the potential of providing novel leads to design new mechanism-based inactivators that are effective against the class d enzymes. several act synergistically when given in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, and others show a unique mechanism of inhibition that is  distinct from the traditional beta-lactamase inhibitors. these studies will bolster structure-based inhibitor design efforts to facilitate the optimization and development of these compounds as class d inactivators.

TI  == electrokinetic stringency control in self-assembled monolayer-based biosensors for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis.
AB  == rapid detection of bacterial pathogens is critical toward judicious management of infectious diseases. herein, we demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency  control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis. the in situ electrokinetic stringency control technique generates joule heating induced temperature rise and electrothermal fluid motion directly on the sensor to improve its performance for detecting bacterial 16s rrna, a phylogenetic biomarker. the dependence of the hybridization efficiency reveals that in situ electrokinetic stringency control is capable of discriminating single-base mismatches. with electrokinetic stringency control, the background noise due to the matrix effects of clinical urine samples can be reduced by 60%. the applicability of the system is demonstrated by multiplex detection of three uropathogenic clinical isolates with similar 16s rrna sequences. the results demonstrate that electrokinetic stringency control can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the biosensor for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis. from the clinical editor: urinary tract infections remain a significant cause of mortality and morbidity as secondary conditions often related to chronic diseases or to immunosuppression. rapid and sensitive identification of the causative organisms  is critical in the appropriate management of this condition. these investigators  demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis, establishing that such an approach significantly improves the biosensor's signal-to-noise ratio.

TI  == molecular detection of hpma and hlya hemolysin of uropathogenic proteus mirabilis.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is one of the bacterial infections frequently documented in humans. proteus mirabilis is associated with uti mainly in individuals with urinary tract abnormality or related with vesicular catheterism  and it can be difficult to treat because of the formation of stones in the bladder and kidneys. these stones are formed due to the presence of urease synthesized by the bacteria. another important factor is that p. mirabilis produces hemolysin hpma, used by the bacteria to damage the kidney tissues. proteus spp. samples can also express hlya hemolysin, similar to that found in escherichia coli. a total of 211 uropathogenic p. mirabilis isolates were analyzed to detect the presence of the hpma and hpmb genes by the techniques of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and dot blot and hlya by pcr. the hpma and hpmb genes were expressed by the rt-pcr technique and two p. mirabilis isolates were sequenced for the hpma and hpmb genes. the presence of the hpma and hpmb genes was confirmed by pcr in 205 (97.15 %) of the 211 isolates. the dot blot confirmed the presence of the hpma and hpmb genes in the isolates that did not amplify in the pcr. none of the isolates studied presented the hlya gene. the hpma and hpmb  genes that were sequenced presented 98 % identity with the same genes of the hi4320 p. mirabilis sample. this study showed that the pcr technique has good sensitivity for detecting the hpma and hpmb genes of p. mirabilis.

TI  == effects of subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials on gene acquisition events in yersinia, proteus, shigella, and salmonella recipient organisms in isolated ligated intestinal loops of swine.
AB  == objective: to assess antimicrobial resistance and transfer of virulence genes facilitated by subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials in swine intestines. animals: 20 anesthetized pigs experimentally inoculated with donor and recipient bacteria. procedures: 4 recipient pathogenic bacteria (salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, or proteus mirabilis) were incubated with donor bacteria in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of 1 of 16 antimicrobials in isolated ligated intestinal loops in swine. donor escherichia coli contained transferrable antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes. after coincubations, intestinal contents were removed and assessed for pathogens that acquired new antimicrobial  resistance or virulence genes following exposure to the subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials. results: 3 antimicrobials (apramycin, lincomycin, and neomycin) enhanced transfer of an antimicrobial resistance plasmid from commensal e coli organisms to yersinia and proteus organisms, whereas 7 antimicrobials (florfenicol, hygromycin, penicillin g, roxarsone, sulfamethazine, tetracycline, and tylosin) exacerbated transfer of an integron (salmonella genomic island 1) from salmonella organisms to yersinia organisms. sulfamethazine induced the transfer of salmonella pathogenicity island 1 from pathogenic to nonpathogenic salmonella organisms. six antimicrobials (bacitracin, carbadox, erythromycin, sulfathiazole, tiamulin, and virginiamycin) did not mediate any transfer events. sulfamethazine was the only antimicrobial implicated in 2 types of transfer events. conclusions and clinical relevance: 10 of 16 antimicrobials at subinhibitory or subtherapeutic concentrations augmented specific antimicrobial resistance or transfer of virulence genes into pathogenic  bacteria in isolated intestinal loops in swine. use of subtherapeutic antimicrobials in animal feed may be associated with unwanted collateral effects.

AB  == the present study was undertaken to understand the distribution and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the uropathogens in the remote islands of india. patients' demographical data, urine culture results, and resistance rates were analyzed and multidrug resistant isolates were characterized. significant bacteriuria was found in 16 (17.7%, 95% confidence interval [ci] 8.47-23.53%) samples, which includes escherichia coli 9 (56.3%); klebsiella pneumoniae 3 (18.8%); enterobacter sp. 2 (12.5%) and proteus mirabilis 2 (12.5%). the uropathogens showed a wide resistance involving 3-21 drugs with 15 different  resistance patterns. among the 16 isolates, 13 (81.3%, 95% ci 62.13-100.37%) and  11 (68.8%, 95% ci 46.04-91.46%) isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins, respectively. multiple mutations were detected in quinolone resistance determining region (qrdr) of the fluoroquinolone resistant isolates and all third generation cephalosporin resistant isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. a total of 7 (44%, 95% ci 17.02-70.98%) isolates was found to harbor plasmid mediated quinolone resistance  determinants the present study reports for the first time the presence of the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (ndm-1) gene in two isolates of p. mirabilis in these islands. detection of multidrug resistant and ndm-1 producing isolates from cases of urinary tract infection in these remote islands lends support to the belief that the existence of these highly resistant strains is perhaps more widespread than previously thought and underscores the need for immediate implementation of antibiotic policy integrated with a continuous surveillance system. the study strengthens the need for a continuous surveillance system of antibiotic resistance in these remote islands.

TI  == adverse effects of members of the enterobacteriaceae family on boar sperm quality.
AB  == semen samples collected in 2012 from 1785 boars belonging to five different breeds were recruited from the quality control laboratory of magapor sl, spain. these samples came from 43 boar studs and resulted from diluting the ejaculates in commercial semen extenders. evaluation of the semen sample characteristics (color, smell, ph, osmolality, concentration, motility of sperm cells, agglutination, acrosome integrity, short hypoosmotic swelling test, and abnormal  forms) revealed that they met the international standards. the samples were also  tested for the presence of aerobic bacterial contamination. in the present study, 14.73% (n = 263) of the semen samples were contaminated above 3 x 10(2) colony-forming units/ml with at least one type of bacteria. the enterobacteriaceae family was by far the major contaminant, being present in 40.68% of the contaminated samples (n = 107). bacterial strains of the enterobacteriaceae family isolated from boar semen samples were in order of incidence (percentage of the contaminated samples): serratia marcescens (12.55%), klebsiella oxytoca (11.79%), providencia stuartii (9.12%), morganella morganii (3.80%), proteus mirabilis (1.90%), and escherichia coli (1.52%). we have seen that the presence in semen samples of s. marcescens, k. oxytoca, m. morganii, or  p. mirabilis, but not p. stuartii or e. coli, was negatively associated with sperm motility (p < 0.05). the mean sperm concentration (p < 0.05), the mean percentage of spermatozoa with curled tails after the short hypoosmotic swelling  test (p < 0.01), and the incidence of morphologically normal acrosomes (p < 0.05) were also lower in semen samples infected with m. morganii compared with uninfected ones. moreover, p. mirabilis was negatively associated with the presence of abnormal forms. thus, on the basis of the pathological effects that some of these strains may have on boar sperm quality, bacterial contamination should always be examined in semen samples prepared for artificial insemination.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial motility and spreading via release of cranberry derived materials from silicone substrates.
AB  == the motility of bacteria plays a key role in their colonization of surfaces during infection. derivatives of cranberry fruit have been shown to interfere with bacterial motility. herein, we report on the incorporation of cranberry derived materials (cdms) into silicone substrates with the aim of impairing bacterial pathogen motility and spreading on the substrate surface. the release of cdms from the silicone substrates when soaking in an aqueous medium was quantified for a period of 24h. next, we showed that cdms released from two silicone substrates remain bioactive as they downregulate the expression of the flagellin gene of two key uropathogens - escherichia coli cft073 and proteus mirabilis hi4320. furthermore, we demonstrate that cdm-modified silicone inhibits the swarming motility of p. mirabilis, an aggressive swarmer. the bioactive, cdm-modified substrates can find broad applications in the medical device and food industries where the impairment of bacterial colonization of surfaces is of  paramount importance.

TI  == the joint in vitro action of polymyxin b and miconazole against pathogens associated with canine otitis externa from three european countries.
AB  == background: canine otitis externa, an inflammation of the external ear canal, can be maintained and worsened by bacterial or fungal infections. for topical treatment, combinations of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial ingredients are mainly used. hypothesis/objectives: this study was conducted to elucidate the in  vitro activity of polymyxin b and miconazole against clinical bacterial isolates  from three european countries, to investigate possible differences in sensitivity and to assess drug interactions. animals: seventeen strains of escherichia coli,  24 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 24 strains of proteus mirabilis and 25 strains of staphylococcus pseudintermedius from dogs with diagnosed otitis externa had been isolated in germany, france and italy. methods: drug activities  were evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration. the potentiation of polymyxin b plus miconazole was calculated using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici). an fici </=0.5 defined synergy. furthermore, geographical variations in the fici and mic were assessed by statistical analysis. results: bacterial susceptibilities were comparable in different european countries, because there were no significant mic and fici variations (p > 0.05). as a single agent, polymyxin b had bactericidal activity against most e. coli and p. aeruginosa strains and, in higher concentrations, against s. pseudintermedius strains. miconazole was bactericidal  against all staphylococcus strains. synergy was demonstrated against strains of e. coli and p. aeruginosa (fici = 0.25 and 0.50, respectively), whereas overall there was no interaction against s. pseudintermedius strains (fici = 1.25). proteus mirabilis strains were not inhibited by each of the drugs individually or by their combination. conclusions and clinical importance: in vitro synergy of polymyxin b and miconazole against e. coli and p. aeruginosa isolates indicates a rationale for applying both agents in combination to treat otitis externa when infected with these types of bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae causing urinary  tract infections in africa.
AB  == our objective was to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae causing urinary tract infections (utis) in adults in africa. the pubmed database was systematically searched to identify relevant studies published after 2000. google, world health organization, and african field epidemiology networks were also searched. twenty-eight studies, accounting for 381,899 urine isolates from 14 african countries, met the inclusion criteria. escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and proteus spp. were the most commonly encountered uropathogens. cefotaxime, imipenem, fosfomycin, and ciprofloxacin were the antibiotics with the highest activity against e. coli isolates from outpatients, with susceptibility being 92 to 99, 100, 100, and 68 to 91%, respectively. the susceptibility among klebsiella spp. isolates from outpatients  varied from 80 to 100% for amikacin and from 53 to 100% for ciprofloxacin, while  susceptibility was 74 to 78, 97, and 77% for ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and fosfomycin, respectively, among klebsiella species isolates from inpatients or patients with hospital-acquired utis. with regard to proteus spp., the highest activity was observed among fluoroquinolones; 71 to 100% of the p. mirabilis isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin in four studies, and 74 to 100% of the p. vulgaris isolates were susceptible to ofloxacin in two studies. the currently  available evidence suggests that the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of enterobacteriaceae uropathogens in african countries were similar to those in countries of southeast europe. further original studies are warranted from african countries for which there is limited published data.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. in majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. this study was designed to find out the etiological agents of uti and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. this study was conducted in  kathmandu model hospital, kathmandu, nepal from april to october, 2009. midstream urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of uti were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth.  antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by modified kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. data were analyzed using spss software window  version 16. the overall prevalence of uti was found to be 18.89%. the most frequent causative organisms isolated were escherichia coli (82.30%), enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), citrobacter freundii (3.60%), enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), coagulase negative staphylococci (2.40%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), proteus mirabilis (0.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). nitrofurantoin and amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. e. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of uti and nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.

TI  == dieselzymes: development of a stable and methanol tolerant lipase for biodiesel production by directed evolution.
AB  == background: biodiesels are methyl esters of fatty acids that are usually produced by base catalyzed transesterification of triacylglyerol with methanol. some lipase enzymes are effective catalysts for biodiesel synthesis and have many potential advantages over traditional base or acid catalyzed transesterification. natural lipases are often rapidly inactivated by the high methanol concentrations used for biodiesel synthesis, however, limiting their practical use. the lipase from proteus mirabilis is a particularly promising catalyst for biodiesel synthesis as it produces high yields of methyl esters even in the presence of large amounts of water and expresses very well in escherichia coli. however, since the proteus mirabilis lipase is only moderately stable and methanol tolerant, these properties need to be improved before the enzyme can be used industrially. results: we employed directed evolution, resulting in a proteus mirabilis lipase variant with 13 mutations, which we call dieselzyme 4. dieselzyme 4 has greatly improved thermal stability, with a 30-fold increase in the half-inactivation time at 50 degrees c relative to the wild-type enzyme. the  evolved enzyme also has dramatically increased methanol tolerance, showing a 50-fold longer half-inactivation time in 50% aqueous methanol. the immobilized dieselzyme 4 enzyme retains the ability to synthesize biodiesel and has improved  longevity over wild-type or the industrially used brukholderia cepacia lipase during many cycles of biodiesel synthesis. a crystal structure of dieselzyme 4 reveals additional hydrogen bonds and salt bridges in dieselzyme 4 compared to the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that polar interactions may become particularly  stabilizing in the reduced dielectric environment of the oil and methanol mixture used for biodiesel synthesis. conclusions: directed evolution was used to produce a stable lipase, dieselzyme 4, which could be immobilized and re-used for biodiesel synthesis. dieselzyme 4 outperforms the industrially used lipase from burkholderia cepacia and provides a platform for still further evolution of desirable biodiesel production properties.

TI  == hydramacin-1 in action: scrutinizing the barnacle model.
AB  == hydramacin-1 (hm1) from the metazoan hydra exerts antimicrobial activity against  a wide range of bacterial strains. notably, hm1 induces the aggregation of bacterial cells, accompanied by precipitation. to date, the proposed mechanism of peptide-lipid interaction, termed the barnacle model, has not been described on the molecular level. here, we show by biochemical and biophysical techniques that the lipid-peptide interactions of hm1 are initiated by electrostatic and hydrophobic effects, in particular, by tryptophan and neighboring polar amino acid residues that cause an interfacial localization of the peptide between two self-contained lipid bilayers. the high binding constants of hm1 upon lipid interaction are in the range of other potent antimicrobial peptides, e.g., magainin, and can be reasonably explained by two distinct epitopes on the surface of the peptide's global structure, which both contain swt(k/r) motifs. the residues of this motif favor localization of the peptide in the head group region of phospholipid bilayers up to a penetration depth of 4 a and a minor participation of the lipids' hydrocarbon regions. our results expand the knowledge about the molecular modes of action antimicrobial peptides use to tackle their target cells. furthermore, the aggregation of living bacteria by hm1 was observed for a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. therefore, the detailed view of peptide-lipid interactions described by the barnacle model consolidates it among the established models.

TI  == in silico maturation of binding-specificity of dna aptamers against proteus mirabilis.
AB  == proteus mirabilis is a prominent cause of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (cautis) among patients undergoing long-term bladder catheterization.  there are currently no effective means of preventing p. mirabilis infections, and strategies for prophylaxis and rapid early diagnosis are urgently required. aptamers offer significant potential for development of countermeasures against p. mirabilis cauti and are an ideal class of molecules for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics. here we demonstrate the application of cell-selex to identify dna aptamers that show high affinity for p. mirabilis. while the aptamers identified displayed high affinity for p. mirabilis cells in dot blotting assays, they also bound to other uropathogenic bacteria. to improve aptamer specificity for p. mirabilis, an in silico maturation (ism) approach was  employed. two cycles of ism allowed the identification of an aptamer showing 36%  higher specificity, evaluated as a ratio of binding signal for p. mirabilis to that for escherichia coli (also a cause of cauti and the most common urinary tract pathogen). aptamers that specifically recognize p. mirabilis would have diagnostic and therapeutic values and constitute useful tools for studying membrane-associated proteins in this organism.

AB  == background: the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) has  tracked the in vitro activity of ertapenem and comparators against aerobic gram-negative bacteria from intra-abdominal infections since 2002. this report describes the epidemiology and susceptibility for clinical isolates associated with appendicitis, collected from 2008 to 2010. methods: a total of 1,720 gram-negative bacilli were collected from patients with appendicitis in 122 hospitals in 39 countries worldwide; of these, 23% of isolates were from pediatric patients (</= 17 years old). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypes were determined by broth microdilution and interpreted using clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. results: the global esbl-positive rate was 16.3%, ranging from 2.2% for proteus mirabilis to 16.6% for escherichia coli and 20.1% for klebsiella pneumoniae. the esbl-positive rates differed by age group (17.7% in adults vs. 11.4% in children) and by geographic region, with significantly higher rates in asia/pacific (28.0%) and significantly lower rates in north america (9.1%), africa/middle east (4.8%), and europe (4.4%). amikacin, imipenem-cilastatin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ertapenem were the most active of the tested agents  against aerobic gram-negative appendicitis pathogens across pediatric and adult age groups and across geographic regions, including esbl-positive isolates. cefepime and ceftazidime were active against >/= 90% of global pediatric isolates. e. coli, by far the most frequently isolated species (68% in adults and 75% in pediatric patients), was significantly less susceptible in adults than in  pediatric patients (p<0.05; fisher exact test) to all tested agents except amikacin, ertapenem, imipenem-cilastatin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin-sulbactam (with the latter showing low activity in both age groups). conclusions: these in vitro data suggest that amikacin, imipenem-cilastatin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ertapenem would perform well against aerobic gram-negative bacilli associated with appendicitis in both adults and children, especially in regions with high rates of esbl-positive e. coli.

TI  == community spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis: a long-term study in japan.
AB  == community-acquired infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria, particularly ctx-m-producing escherichia coli, are a rising concern worldwide. there are few data from japan on the acquisition of esbls in the community or the influx of these bacteria into hospitals. therefore, we examined the prevalence of esbl carriage in outpatients, in order to estimate  the spread of esbls in community settings. we analysed bacterial isolates from outpatient samples at our institution over a 9-year period from 2003 to 2011, with respect to epidemiological data on esbl-producing bacteria and their genotypic features. out of 5137 isolates, 321 (6.3 %) were esbl producers, including e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. the detection rates of the esbl-producing isolates gradually increased and reached 14.3, 8.7 and 19.6 % for e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis strains, respectively, in  2011. genotyping analysis showed that many of the strains produced multiple beta-lactamases, including tem, shv and ctx-m, rather than just ctx-m. the ctx-m-9 group was dominant among the ctx-m genotypes; further, the ctx-m-1 and m-2 groups were also detected (~30 %). this is believed to be the first report from japan showing a definite increase in esbl detection in outpatients. in addition, our findings suggest the simultaneous community spread of diverse esbl  genotypes, not an expansion of particular esbl genes.

TI  == outcomes in uk patients with hospital-acquired bacteraemia and the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
AB  == purpose: there is lack of contemporary outcome data on patients with hospital-acquired infections that cause bacteraemia. we determined the risk factors for 7-day mortality and investigated the hypothesis that, compared with central venous catheter (cvc)-associated bacteraemic infections, catheter-associated bacteraemic urinary tract infections (utis) were significantly associated with 7-day mortality. methods: from october 2007 to september 2008, demographical, clinical and microbiological data were collected on patients with hospital-acquired bacteraemia. patients were followed until death, hospital discharge or recovery from infection. risk factors for 7-day mortality were determined and multivariate logistic regression was used to define the association between catheter-associated bacteraemic utis and likelihood of death. results: 559 bacteraemic episodes occurred in 437 patients. overall, there were 90 deaths (20.6%) at 7 days and 153 deaths (35.0%) at 30 days. among patients with catheter-associated bacteraemic utis, 7-day and 30-day mortalities  associated with each bacteraemic episode were 25/83 (30.1%) and 33/83 (39.8%), respectively. within this subgroup, the commonest isolates were escherichia coli, 36 (43.4%), proteus mirabilis, 11 (13.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9 (10.8%).  there were 22 (26.5%) multiple drug-resistant isolates and, of the e coli infections, 6 (16.7%) were extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers. in univariate analysis, the variables found to have the strongest association with 7-day mortality were age, pitt score, charlson comorbidity index (cci), medical speciality and site of infection. compared with cvc-associated bacteraemic infections, there was a significant association between catheter-associated bacteraemic utis and 7-day mortality (or 4.16, 95% ci 1.86 to 9.33). after adjustment for age and cci, this association remained significant (or 2.90, 95% ci 1.19 to 7.07). conclusions: compared with cvc-associated bacteraemic infections, catheter-associated bacteraemic utis were significantly associated with 7-day mortality. efforts to reduce these infections should be prioritised.

TI  == carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: results from the surveillance of multicentre antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart) in 2009.
AB  == to investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by the clsi as well as 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by eucast. based on clsi 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively. all proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii isolates  were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of p. mirabilis and all m. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae isolates. e. coli, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae with ertapenem mics>/=4 mg/l were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, respectively.  additionally, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=8 mg/l were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. these data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae as well as p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=4 mg/l.

TI  == serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of ssis.
AB  == background: despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (ssis) is still high. an improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. the aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness  of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. methods: a total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several  surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. results: after single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and non-esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae. moreover, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans  were also inhibited. we found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring:  at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional ssis. conclusions: these preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.

TI  == aetiology and antibiotic resistance patterns of urinary tract infections in the elderly: a 6-month study.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are a common cause of bacteraemia in the elderly  and are associated with a high probability of hospitalization. despite the impact of utis on health status and quality of life, a limited number of studies have evaluated their aetiology in this population. this study aimed to evaluate the microbial aetiology and pattern of susceptibility of bacteria causing utis in the elderly. for this purpose, a retrospective cohort study of elderly residents (n = 472, aged >65 years) in 14 nursing homes in milan (italy) and its province was performed. globally, 393 micro-organisms from 328 samples were isolated: escherichia coli was the most prevalent (44.8 %), followed by proteus mirabilis (20.4 %), providencia spp. (8.9 %), klebsiella spp. (6.4 %) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.6 %). enterococci were the most frequently isolated gram-positive organisms (7.4 %). almost all enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to nitrofurantoin, carbapenems and amikacin. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were  detected in 42.1 % of isolates. the most active antibiotics against p. aeruginosa were colistin, amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. all gram-positive organisms  were susceptible to glycopeptides and linezolid, and 90 % were susceptible to nitrofurantoin. fluoroquinolones showed a limited activity against all the tested micro-organisms. escherichia coli remains the major micro-organism responsible for utis in older people, although to a lesser extent than in a younger population. the high rates of resistance observed in this study make careful use  of antibiotics advisable to limit further development of resistance.

TI  == study of photodynamic therapy in the control of isolated microorganisms from infected wounds--an in vitro study.
AB  == the effective treatment of infected wounds continues to be a serious challenge, mainly due to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. photodynamic therapy (pdt) refers to the topical or systemic administration of a non-toxic, photosensitizing agent (ps), followed by irradiation with visible light of a suitable wavelength. the possibility of applying the pdt locally is what makes it so favorable to the treatment of infected wounds. the goal of this study was to evaluate the action of the pdt in the inactivation in vitro of microorganisms coming from infected wounds, using methylene blue (mb) and photodithazine (pdz) as the ps and comparing the efficacy of these two compounds for pdt on bacteria.  for the application of pdt, isolated microorganisms identified from material collected from wounds were suspended in a saline solution containing 10(6) viable cells/ml. each isolated microorganism was submitted to pdt with mb and with pdz in accordance with the following treatment groups: n/t--no treatment; t1--pdt with pdz; t2--pdt with mb; t3--irradiation without ps; t4--treatment with pdz without light; and t5--treatment with mb without light. as a light source, an led-based device was used (biopdi/irrad-lead 660), composed of 54 leds, each with 70 mw of power in the 660 nm region of the electromagnetic spectrum. each tray of 96 wells was irradiated with an intensity of 25 mw/cm(2) and a dose of light of 50 j/cm(3) for 33 min. all the tests were made in duplicate. it was then concluded that the pdt with pdz was capable of inhibiting the growth of gram-positive bacteria samples, however it did not have the same effect on gram-negative bacteria, which showed growth greater than 100,000 cfu; the pdt with mb showed an effectiveness on gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria, for it was able to inhibit bacterial growth in both cases.

TI  == urinary tract infection among symptomatic outpatients visiting a tertiary hospital based in midwestern nigeria.
AB  == microbial pathogens implicated in urinary tract infection and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns as prevalent in uti symptomatic outpatients resident in benin city, nigeria was the focus of this study. one hundred (100) midstream urine samples were collected into sterile plastic universal bottles from outpatients who visited the university of benin teaching hospital, nigeria and who were tentatively diagnosed as manifesting symptoms of uti. patients were referred to the medical microbiology department by the consulting doctors. significant bacterial counts and neutrophil (pus cells) counts were carried out on samples by standard methods. positive samples for both counts were inoculated  aseptically on sterile macconkey agar, cystine lactose electrolyte deficient (cled) agar and sabouraud dextrose agar plates and incubated appropriately. microbial isolates were identified and antibiotic sensitivity testing was carried out on isolates by standard methods. thirty nine (39.0%) and 61 (61.0%) samples recorded significant microbial growth and no growth respectively. gram negative bacilli constituted 86.1% (of which enterobacteriaceae made up 49.9%) while gram  positive cocci made up 13.9%. strains of uropathogens isolated were alcaligenes spp (19.4%), klebsiella aerogenes (16.7%), escherichia coli (13.9%), staphylococcus aureus (13.9%), candida albicans (11.1%), proteus mirabilis (8.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.5%), enterobacter spp (5.5%) and providencia spp (5.5%). occurrence of uti in male and female patients were 58.3% and 41.7% respectively of which uti occurred highest in the 25-46, 15-54 and 27-54 age groups in that decreasing order. alcaligenes spp occurred most in very old female patients. candida albicans (the only fungal uropathogen) occurred in an 8day old  male patient. other isolates occurred in much older patients. a significantly high microscopic neutrophil count or pyuria was recorded from deposits of uti positive patients (i.e. &lt; 5/hpf). eighteen (representing 50.5%) and 15 (47.8%) of total microbial strains isolated were sensitive to nitrofurantoin and ceftriaxone respectively. antibiotic susceptibility profile also showed 13(41.6%), 13(41.6%), 13(41.6%) for ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime and ofloxacin respectively suggesting moderate sensitivity of the fluoroquinolones and second/third generation cephalosporins. gentamicin, ampicillin and augmentin recorded over 70.0% resistance level each. a total of nineteen bacterial strains  made of e.coli, enterobacter spp, proteus mirabilis, providencia spp, staph. aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were multi drug resistant as they resisted 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 and 8 antibiotics respectively.

TI  == antibiotic resistance patterns of outpatient pediatric urinary tract infections.
AB  == purpose: we characterize the current national patterns of antibiotic resistance of outpatient pediatric urinary tract infection. materials and methods: we examined outpatient urinary isolates from patients younger than 18 years in 2009  using the surveillance network(r), a database with antibiotic susceptibility results and patient demographic data from 195 united states hospitals. we determined the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns for the 6 most common uropathogens, ie escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella, enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. we compared differences in uropathogen prevalence between males and females using chi-square analysis. results: we identified 25,418 outpatient urinary isolates. e. coli was the most common uropathogen overall but the prevalence of e. coli was higher among females (83%) than males (50%, p <0.001). other common species among males were enterococcus (17%), p. mirabilis (11%) and klebsiella (10%). however, these uropathogens each accounted for 5% or less of female isolates (p <0.001). resistance among e. coli was highest for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (24%) but  lower for nitrofurantoin (less than 1%) and cephalothin (15%). compared to 2002 surveillance network data, e. coli resistance rates increased for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (from 23% to 31% in males and from 20% to 23% in females) and ciprofloxacin (from 1% to 10% and from 0.6% to 4%, respectively). conclusions: e. coli remains the most common pediatric uropathogen. although widely used, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a poor empirical choice for pediatric urinary tract infections in many areas due to high resistance rates. first-generation cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin are appropriate narrow-spectrum alternatives given their low resistance rates. local antibiograms should be used to assist with empirical urinary tract infection treatment.

TI  == flgm proteins from different bacteria exhibit different structural characteristics.
AB  == intrinsically disordered proteins (idps) are a unique class of proteins that do not require a stable structure for function. the importance of idps in many biological processes has been established but there remain unanswered questions about their evolution and conservation of their disordered state within a protein family. our group has been studying the structural similarities among orthologous flgm proteins, a model class of idps. we have previously shown that the flgm protein from the thermophile aquifex aeolicus has more structure at a. aeolicus'  physiological temperature (85 degrees c) than is observed for the salmonella typhimurium flgm, suggesting that the disordered nature of flgm varies among organisms and is not universally conserved. in this work, we extend these studies to the flgm proteins from escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and bacillus subtilis. we demonstrate that the b. subtilis, e. coli, and s. typhimurium flgms exist in a premolten globule-like conformation, though the b. subtilis flgm is in a more compacted conformation than the other two. the  p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis flgm proteins exist in a currently unknown conformation that is not either coil-like or premolten globule-like. the p. aeruginosa flgm appears to contain more weak intramolecular contacts given its more compacted state than the p. mirabilis flgm. these results provide experimental evidence that members of the same protein family can exhibit different degrees of disorder, though understanding how different disordered states evolve in the same protein family will require more study.

TI  == one-step production of alpha-ketoglutaric acid from glutamic acid with an engineered l-amino acid deaminase from proteus mirabilis.
AB  == currently, alpha-ketoglutaric acid (alpha-kg) is industrially produced by multi-step chemical synthesis, which can cause heavy environmental pollution. here we reported a simple one-step approach for the production of alpha-kg by transforming l-glutamic acid with an engineered l-amino acid deaminase (l-aad) from proteus mirabilis. first, to facilitate the purification of membrane-bound l-aad, one n-terminal transmembrane region (from 21 to 87th nucleotide) was removed from l-aad to block the binding of l-aad with membrane, and the relatively low-usage codons were replaced by high-usage codons in escherichia coli to improve the expression level. however, inclusion bodies formed when expressing the deltan-laad in e. coli bl 21, and then the soluble and active deltan-laad was obtained by the solubilization and renaturation of deltan-laad. furthermore, the biochemical properties of the refolded deltan-laad were characterized and compared with those of full-length l-aad. finally, the deltan-laad was used to synthesize alpha-kg and the maximal formation rate of alpha-kg reached 12.6% (w/w) at 6h under the following conditions: 12g/l l-glutamic acid, 0.1g/l deltan-laad, 5mm mgcl2, temperature 45 degrees c and ph 8.0. compared with the multi-step chemical synthesis, the transformation approach has less environmental pollution and has a great potential for alpha-kg production.

TI  == microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in central alabama.
AB  == urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. they are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. the purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in central alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. this was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their  antibiotic resistance profile at this central alabama hospital. the survey period was between july 2009 and june 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed  and susceptibility testing was determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) microdilution method. the results indicated that escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.8%), enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (3.0%),  klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter freundii (1.5%), morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). for the 215 e. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, p < 0.05). in contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, p < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this central alabama hospital. additionally, this study found that e. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (lee et al. 2010; rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. it is imperative to monitor the resistance of p. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.

TI  == american journal of gastroenterology lecture: intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (fmt) in treatment of c. difficile infection.
AB  == the vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. moreover, vital interactions of  the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. a perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated  with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including clostridium difficile infection (cdi). it has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic cdi, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. in addition, fmt has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-cdi diseases is in its infancy. more work needs to be done with fmt to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. there is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to  cure disease. fmt is but the first step in this journey.

TI  == comparison of antibiotic resistance patterns in collections of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis uropathogenic strains.
AB  == escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis are important urinary tract pathogens. the constant increase in the antibiotic resistance of clinical bacterial strains has  become an important clinical problem. the aim of this study was to compare the antibiotic resistance of 141 clinical (sweden and poland) and 42 laboratory (czech republic) p. mirabilis strains and 129 clinical (poland) uropathogenic e.  coli strains. the proportion of unique versus diverse patterns in swedish clinical and laboratory p. mirabilis strain collections was comparable. notably,  a similar proportion of unique versus diverse patterns was observed in polish clinical p. mirabilis and e. coli strain collections. mathematical models of the  antibiotic resistance of e. coli and p. mirabilis strains based on kohonen networks and association analysis are presented. in contrast to the three clinical strain collections, which revealed complex associations with the antibiotics tested, laboratory p. mirabilis strains provided simple antibiotic association diagrams. the monitoring of antibiotic resistance patterns of clinical e. coli and p. mirabilis strains plays an important role in the treatment procedures for urinary tract infections and is important in the context of the spreading drug resistance in uropathogenic strain populations. the adaptability and flexibility of the genomes of e. coli and p. mirabilis strains are discussed.

TI  == molecular diversity of class 2 integrons in antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria found in wastewater environments in china.
AB  == the molecular architecture of class 2 integrons among gram-negative bacteria from wastewater environments was investigated in jinan, china. out of the 391 antibiotic-resistant bacteria found, 38 isolates harboring class 2 integrons encoding potentially transferrable genes that could confer antibiotic resistance  were found. these isolates were classified into 19 rep-pcr types. these strains were identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing and found to be as follows: proteus mirabilis (16), escherichia coli (7), providencia spp. (7), proteus spp.  (2), p. vulgaris (3), shigella sp. (1), citrobacter freundii (1), and acinetobacter sp. (1). their class 2 integron cassette arrays were amplified and  then either analyzed using pcr-rflp or sequenced. the typical array dfra1-sat2-aada1 was detected in 27 isolates. six atypical arrays were observed,  including three kinds of novel arrangements (linf2(attc1)-dfra1(attc2)-aada1-orf441 or linf2(attc1)-dfra1(attc2)-aada1, dfra1-catb2-sat2-aada1, and estx(vr)-sat2-aada1) and a hybrid with the 3'cs of class 1 integrons (dfra1-sat2-aada1-qach), and dfra1-sat1. twenty-four isolates were also found to carry class 1 integrons with 10 types of gene cassette arrays. several non-integron-associated antibiotic resistance genes were found, and their transferability was investigated. results showed that water sources in the jinan  region harbored a diverse community of both typical and atypical class 2 integrons, raising concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and their careless disposal into the environment.

TI  == contribution of structural domains to the activity of ribonuclease 7 against uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == ribonuclease 7 (rnase 7) is a 14.5-kda peptide that possesses potent antimicrobial properties against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and is  expressed in a variety of epithelial tissues. little is known about its mechanisms of action and the determinants of its antimicrobial properties. the objective of this study was to identify the intrinsic functional domains of rnase 7 that influence its activity against uropathogenic bacteria. a series of rnase 7 fragments were generated that contained different components of its secondary motifs starting from both the n terminus and the c terminus of rnase 7. we determined the antimicrobial properties of each fragment against both gram-positive staphylococcus saprophyticus and gram-negative escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. rnase 7 fragments displayed significant differences in their antimicrobial activity profiles. compared to n-terminal fragments, c-terminal fragments showed uniformly decreased activity against gram-negative e. coli and p. mirabilis and gram-positive s. saprophyticus. fragments that lack beta-sheets  1, 3, and 4 also demonstrated significantly decreased activities. we have also identified one fragment with at least 4-fold increased potency against both e. coli and staphylococcus compared to full-length peptide. we identified distinct regions of the peptide that are independently responsible for gram-negative and gram-positive activity. our results suggest that distinct mechanisms are responsible for rnase 7's antimicrobial activity against various uropathogens.

TI  == the effect of copper(ii), iron(ii) sulphate, and vitamin c combinations on the weak antimicrobial activity of (+)-catechin against staphylococcus aureus and other microbes.
AB  == few attempts have been made to improve the activity of plant compounds with low antimicrobial efficacy. (+)-catechin, a weak antimicrobial tea flavanol, was combined with putative adjuncts and tested against different species of bacteria. copper(ii) sulphate enhanced (+)-catechin activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa but not staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis or escherichia coli. attempts to raise the activity of (+)-catechin against two unresponsive species, s. aureus and e. coli, with iron(ii) sulphate, iron(iii) chloride, and vitamin c, showed that iron(ii) enhanced (+)-catechin against s. aureus, but not e. coli; neither iron(iii) nor combined iron(ii) and copper(ii), enhanced (+)-catechin activity against either species. vitamin c enhanced copper(ii) containing combinations against both species in the absence of iron(ii). catalase or edta added to active samples removed viability effects suggesting that active mixtures had produced h(2)o(2)via the action of added metal(ii) ions. h(2)o(2) generation by (+)-catechin plus copper(ii) mixtures and copper(ii) alone could account for the  principal effect of bacterial growth inhibition following 30 minute exposures as  well as the antimicrobial effect of (+)-catechin-iron(ii) against s. aureus. these novel findings about a weak antimicrobial flavanol contrast with previous knowledge of more active flavanols with transition metal combinations. weak antimicrobial compounds like (+)-catechin within enhancement mixtures may therefore be used as efficacious agents. (+)-catechin may provide a means of lowering copper(ii) or iron(ii) contents in certain crop protection and other products.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

AB  == background: gram-negative bacilli causing community-onset urinary tract infections (coutis) are getting increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. clinical significance and risk factors of the acquisition of antimicrobial-nonsusceptible pathogens are still under investigation. methods: a  prospective study was performed in the medical wards of two hospitals in southern taiwan between august 2009 and january 2012. patients were enrolled if they were  aged >18, admitted through the emergency department, and had couti due to enterobacteriaceae isolates. results: overall 136 adults with couti were enrolled. their mean age was 67 years and females were predominant (68.4%). comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus (30.1%) and hypertension (54.4%), were common. escherichia coli (111, 81.6%) was the predominant species, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (11, 8.1%), and proteus mirabilis (7, 5.1%). nine (8.0%) of e. coli isolates and 5 (45%) of k. pneumoniae isolates had extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production. out of 122 non-esbl producing isolates, 35 (28.7%) and 31 (25.4%) were nonsusceptible to levofloxacin and cefazolin, respectively. in the multivariate analysis, several clinical characters were found to be independently associated with coutis due to levofloxacin-nonsusceptible (i.e. males, recent hospitalization, underlying old stroke, diabetes mellitus, and altered consciousness, or absence of chills, pyuria, or tachycardia), cefazolin-nonsusceptible (i.e. males, recent hospitalization, underlying old stroke, absence of fever or chills), or esbl-producing isolates (i.e. recent hospitalization or antimicrobial therapy). all patients survived and discharged. however, the patients with coutis due to levofloxacin-nonsusceptible (16.1 vs. 7.5 days, p < 0.01), cefazolin-nonsusceptible (15.4 vs. 8.4 days, p < 0.01) or esbl-producing (16.7 vs. 9.6 days; p < 0.01) pathogens had a longer hospitalization stay than those due to their susceptible comparators. conclusion: several host factors were recognized to be independently associated with the acquisition of utis due to levofloxacin- or cefazolin- nonsusceptible, or esbl-producing gram-negative bacilli. the clinical impact of utis due to nonsusceptible uropathogens is that they result in the prolongation of hospital stays.

TI  == impact of ph on activity of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem in human urine.
AB  == objective: although major impairment of activity at lower ph values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). until now, there is little evidence for the influence of ph on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. methods: bacterial growth curves of staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), klebsiella oxytoca (atcc 700324), proteus mirabilis (atcc 14153), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) were performed in mueller-hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a ph of between 5.0 and 8.0. bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin,  amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the mic. results: while no difference in the bacterial growth of e. coli, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca was observed at different ph values, bacterial growth of e. faecalis was  significantly reduced at low ph. acidification to ph 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. conclusion: the present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of utis should be carefully considered. while growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during utis, the most common pathogen, e. coli, was not affected by low ph. independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, ph values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.

AB  == to determine the distribution of urinary tract pathogens with focus on staphylococcus saprophyticus and analyse the seasonality, antibiotic susceptibility, and gender and age distributions in a large swedish cohort. s. saprophyticus is considered an important causative agent of urinary tract infection (uti) in young women, and some earlier studies have reported up to approximately 40% of utis in this patient group being caused by s. saprophyticus. we hypothesized that this may be true only in very specific outpatient settings.  during the year 2010, 113,720 urine samples were sent for culture to the karolinska university hospital, from both clinics in the hospital and from primary care units. patient age, gender and month of sampling were analysed for s. saprophyticus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis.  species data were obtained for 42,633 (37%) of the urine samples. the most common pathogens were e. coli (57.0%), enterococcus faecalis (6.5%), k. pneumoniae (5.9%), group b streptococci (5.7%), p. mirabilis (3.0%) and s. saprophyticus (1.8%). the majority of subjects with s. saprophyticus were women 15-29 years of  age (63.8%). in this age group, s. saprophyticus constituted 12.5% of all urinary tract pathogens. s. saprophyticus is a common urinary tract pathogen in young women, but its relative importance is low compared with e. coli even in this patient group. for women in other ages and for men, growth of s. saprophyticus is a quite uncommon finding.

TI  == cefditoren: comparative efficacy with other antimicrobials and risk factors for resistance in clinical isolates causing utis in outpatients.
AB  == background: to investigate a possible role of cefditoren, a recently marketed in  greece third-generation oral cephalosporin in urinary infections of outpatients.  methods: during a multicenter survey of enterobacteriaceae causing utis in outpatients during 2005-2007, cefditoren mics were determined by agar dilution method in a randomly selected sample of uropathogens. susceptibility against 18 other oral/parenteral antimicrobials was determined according to clinical and laboratory standards institute methodology. results: a total of 563 isolates (330 escherichia coli, 142 proteus mirabilis and 91 klebsiella spp) was studied; mic50/mic90 of cefditoren was 0.25/0.5 mg/l respectively, with 97.1% of the isolates being inhibited at 1 mg/l. all 12 strains producing esbls or ampc enzymes were resistant to cefditoren. susceptibility rates (%) for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and fosfomycin were 93.1- 94.1- 96.8-93.1-71.9 and  92.8% respectively. cefditoren mic was significantly higher in nalidixic/ciprofloxacin non-susceptible strains; resistance to cefditoren was not associated with resistance to mecillinam, fosfomycin nitrofurantoin and aminoglycosides. multivariate analysis demonstrated history of urinary infection  in the last two weeks or three months as risk factors for cefditoren resistance.  conclusions: cefditoren exhibited enhanced in vitro activity against the most common uropathogens in the outpatient setting, representing an alternative oral treatment option in patients with risk factors for resistance to first-line antibiotics.

TI  == [randomized comparative study for the assessment of a new therapeutic schedule of fosfomycin trometamol in postmenopausal women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection].
AB  == objectives: to compare two therapeutic regimes in terms of bacterial eradication  of post-menopausal with uncomplicated acute cystitis who complete antibiotic treatment. materials and method: a multicenter, randomized, prospective and controlled study between two short antibiotic regimes: fosfomycin trometamol (fmt) 3g, 2 doses separated by 72hours and ciprofloxacin 250mg every 12hours for  3 days. a total of 118 post-menopausal women were enrolled in the study. they underwent an initial urine culture to know the responsible microorganism and susceptibility to treatment. this was repeated 5-7 days and 4 weeks after the treatment to evaluate bacterial eradication. clinical symptoms and treatment safety were also evaluated. results: there were microbiological data at the onset of the treatment in 82 women (69.49%). of these, 27 did not have positive culture at the first visit (30.51%), 76 (64.41%) fulfilled all the protocol requirements  and adverse effects from the treatment were collected in 113 (95.76%) of the patients enrolled in the study. the germs isolated most frequently were escherichia coli (e. coli) (76.83%), klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) (7.32%), proteus mirabilis (p. mirabilis) (4.89%) and enterococo sp. (3.66%). in  terms of efficacy, no differences were detected in the proportion of patients who achieved bacterial eradication between the two study arms: 62.16% of the patients who received fmt and 58.97% of those treated with ciprofloxacin (chi-square, p=0.78). the proportion of patients who achieved clinical cure was also similar (86.49% for fmt and 82.05% for ciprofloxacin; square, p=0.59). these results indicate similar efficacy of both antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated lower tract urinary infection in post-menopausal women. in regards to safety data, the proportion of global adverse effects associated to the treatments was 3.45% for fmt and 9.09% for ciprofloxacin. treatment compliance was 100% for fmt  and 83.64% for ciprofloxacin. conclusions: the fmt administered at a dose of 3g every 72hours (2 total doses) and ciprofloxacin at a dose of 250mg every 12hours  during 3 days (6 total doses) have a comparable efficacy profile in lower tract urinary infection in post-menopausal women who adequately comply with the treatment, also having comparable safety. the fmt has a better antimicrobial susceptibility profile and better rate of treatment compliance.

TI  == emphysematous pyelonephritis in a patient infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  == emphysematous pyelonephritis (epn) is a rapidly progressive and life-threatening  infection that is seen most commonly in persons with diabetes. the infecting organisms usually consist of mixed flora, including escherichia coli (68%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) and proteus mirabilis. females are affected twice as often as men, and mortality rates can be as high as 80%. obstructive uropathy, urinary calculi, calyceal stenosis and neoplasms are significant predisposing factors. we report a case of epn in a patient with the human immunodeficiency virus infection, without diabetes mellitus or urinary tract obstruction, which responded remarkably to conservative management with antibiotics alone.

TI  == expression of the disa amino acid decarboxylase from proteus mirabilis inhibits motility and class 2 flagellar gene expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == in proteus mirabilis, a putative phenylalanine decarboxylase (disa) acts in a regulatory pathway to inhibit class 2 flagellar gene expression and motility. in  this study, we demonstrate that disa expression in escherichia coli blocked motility and resulted in a 50-fold decrease in the expression of class 2 (flia) and class 3 (flic) flagellar genes. however, the expression of flhdc encoding the class 1 activator of the flagellar cascade was unchanged by disa expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. phenethylamine, a decarboxylation product derived from phenylalanine, was able to mimic disa overexpression and decrease both motility and class 2/3 flagellar gene expression. in addition, both disa overexpression and phenethylamine strongly inhibited biofilm formation in e. coli. disa overexpression and exogenous phenethylamine could also reduce motility in other enteric bacteria, but had no effect on motility in non-enteric gram-negative bacteria. it is hypothesized that phenethylamine or a closely related compound formed by the disa decarboxylation reaction inhibits the formation or activity of the flhd(4)c(2) complex required for activation of class 2 genes.

TI  == prevalence and molecular epidemiology of acquired ampc beta-lactamases and carbapenemases in enterobacteriaceae isolates from 35 hospitals in spain.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the prevalence of plasmid-mediated ampc (pampc) and carbapenemases in enterobacteriaceae collected  from 35 hospitals in spain and to establish their epidemiological relationships.  we conducted a prospective multi-centre study on pampc- or carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates from clinical samples collected from february to july 2009. the strains suspected to carry pampc were resistant or showed intermediate susceptibility to co-amoxiclav and second- or third-generation cephalosporins. strains suspected to carry a carbapenemase were  selected because they showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) to imipenem >1 mg/l. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and a sequencing strategy were used to characterise the enzymes. the clonal relationships between isolates was analysed  by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). among 100,132 enterobacteriaceae isolates collected, 1,654 were compatible with the production of pampc or carbapenemases. we found a prevalence of 0.64 % of pampc (n = 635) and 0.04 % of  carbapenemases (n = 43). the most prevalent pampc enzymes were cmy-type (78.3 %), dha-type (19.5 %), acc-type (1.6 %) and fox-type (0.6 %). the cmy-type was the most frequent in escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis species, whereas the dha-type was mainly found in klebsiella spp. the enzymes involved in carbapenem resistance were vim-1, imp-22 and the new imp-28. nine new bla genes were described: bla (cmy-54), bla (cmy-55), bla (cmy-56), bla (cmy-57), bla (cmy-96),  bla (dha-6), bla (dha-7), bla (fox-8) and bla (imp-28). the prevalence of pampc or carbapenemases found is not negligible. the cmy-types were the predominant pampc, whereas the vim or imp enzymes were the predominant carbapenemases. furthermore, we observed a great genetic diversity among pampc-producing strains  and a close clonal relationship between carbapenemase-producing strains.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == epidemiology and genetic characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria causing urinary tract infections  in long-term care facilities.
AB  == objectives: to assess risk factors for acquiring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (esbl+ gn) causing urinary tract  infections (utis) in long-term care facilities (ltcfs). methods: a prospective case-case-control study was carried out. in the first study, cases were defined as patients harbouring esbl+ gn, while, in the second study, cases were defined as patients harbouring esbl-negative (esbl-) gn. controls were selected by simple random sampling from patients without gn infection. esbl determinants were characterized by hybridization, and confirmed by pcr and sequencing. results: the study involved 297 ltcf patients (99 with esbl+ gn uti, 99 with esbl- gn uti and  99 without gn infection). esbl+ gn utis were due to escherichia coli (64%), proteus mirabilis (25%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (11%). the ctx-m-type enzymes were the most prevalent (73% of isolates), whereas tem- and shv-type esbls and ampc-type enzymes were less prevalent (10%, 2% and 15% of isolates, respectively). patients with esbl+ gn uti were more likely to have a permanent urinary catheter (or 15, 95% ci 6.9-30.5) and to have received antimicrobial therapy in the previous 30 days (or 4, 95% ci 1.2-10.9). after adjusting for type, dosage and duration of antibiotic, exposure to >/=7 days of quinolones and  third-generation cephalosporins was associated with the highest risk of esbl+ gn  uti development (or 7, 95% ci 1.2-40). independent risk factors for acquiring esbl- gn utis were previous surgical procedures (or 2, 95% ci 1.1-4) and the presence of a urinary catheter (or 8, 95% ci 4-16). no specific antibiotics remained a significant risk for esbl- gn uti after adjusting for demographic and  clinical risk factors. conclusions: exposure to >/=7 days of quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins significantly increases the risk of esbl+ gn uti. interventions aimed at improving compliance with antimicrobial stewardship principles should be further developed and implemented in ltcfs.

TI  == a conformational switch in a partially unwound helix selectively determines the pathway for substrate release from the carnitine/gamma-butyrobetaine antiporter cait.
AB  == cait is a homotrimeric antiporter that exchanges l-carnitine (crn) with gamma-butyrobetaine (gbb) across the bacterial membrane. three structures have been resolved to date for cait, all in the inward-facing state: crn-bound (with four crns per subunit), gbb-bound (two gbbs per subunit), and apo. one of the reported binding sites is the counterpart of the primary site observed in structurally similar transporters. however, the mechanism and pathway(s) of crn/gbb unbinding and translocation, or even the ability of the substrates to dislodge from the reported binding sites, are yet to be determined. to shed light on these issues, we performed a total of 1.3 mus of molecular dynamics simulations and examined the dynamics of substrate-bound cait structures under different conditions. we find that both crn and gbb are able to dissociate completely from their primary site into the cytoplasm. substrate molecules initially located at the secondary sites dissociate even faster (within tens of nanoseconds) into the extra- or intracellular regions. interestingly, the unbinding pathway from the primary site appears to be dictated by the geometry of the unwound part of the transmembrane (tm) helix 3, mostly around thr(100) therein. arg(262) on tm7, which apparently mimics the role of na(+) in cait structural homologues, plays a key role in triggering the dissociation of the substrate away from the primary site and guiding its release to the cytoplasm provided that the unwound part of tm3 switches from a shielding to a yielding pose.

TI  == standardization of isothermal microcalorimetry in urinary tract infection detection by using artificial urine.
AB  == purpose: isothermal microcalorimetry (imc) has recently been reported as a new method to rapidly detect urinary tract pathogens (utp). however, further application of microcalorimetry in the clinical setting requires a standardized procedure. an important step toward such standardization is to use a reproducible growth medium. in this study, we investigated the potential of artificial urine in combination with microcalorimetry for detection of common utp. methods: a microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. detection was accomplished,  and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in artificial urine at 37 degrees c by measuring metabolic heat flow (muw = muj/s) as a function of time. the strains were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, and  staphylococcus aureus. result: bacterial growth was detected after 3-32 h with decreasing inoculums down to 1 cfu. the gram-negative strains grew and were detected faster than their gram-positive counterparts. the growth rates the different strains were 0.75 +/- 0.11 for e. coli, 0.74 +/- 0.10 for e. faecalis,  1.31 +/- 0.04 for p. mirabilis, and 0.56 +/- 0.20 for s. aureus. the shape of individual heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. conclusions: imc allows rapid detection of utp in artificial urine. clearly, different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen  differentiation. utp detection after only 4 h is realistic. the rapid detection of utp tested in standardized artificial urine proves the diagnostic potential of imc and warrants further microcalorimetric studies in the clinical setting of urinary tract infections.

AB  == salmonella genomic island 1 (sgi1) is a 43-kb integrative mobilizable element that harbors a great diversity of multidrug resistance gene clusters described in numerous salmonella enterica serovars and also in proteus mirabilis. the majority of sgi1 variants contain an in104-derivative complex class 1 integron inserted between resolvase gene res and open reading frame (orf) s044 in sgi1. recently, the international spread of ciprofloxacin-resistant s. enterica serovar kentucky  sequence type 198 (st198) containing sgi1-k variants has been reported. a retrospective study was undertaken to characterize st198 s. kentucky strains isolated before the spread of the epidemic st198-sgi1-k population in africa and  the middle east. here, we characterized 12 st198 s. kentucky strains isolated between 1969 and 1999, mainly from humans returning from southeast asia (n = 10 strains) or israel (n = 1 strain) or from meat in egypt (n = 1 strain). all these st198 s. kentucky strains did not belong to the xbai pulsotype x1 associated with the african epidemic clone but to pulsotype x2. sgi1-j subgroup variants containing different complex integrons with a partial transposition module and inserted within orf s023 of sgi1 were detected in six strains. the sgi1-j4 variant containing a partially deleted class 1 integron and thus showing a narrow resistance phenotype to sulfonamides was identified in two epidemiologically unrelated strains from indonesia. the four remaining strains harbored a novel sgi1-j variant, named sgi1-j6, which contained aada2, flor2, tetr(g)-teta(g), and sul1 resistance genes within its complex integron. moreover, in all these s. kentucky isolates, a novel insertion sequence related to the is630 family and named issen5 was found inserted upstream of the sgi1 complex integron in orf s023. thus, two subpopulations of s. kentucky st198 independently and exclusively acquired the sgi1 during the 1980s and 1990s. unlike the st198-x1 african epidemic subpopulation, the st198-x2 subpopulation mainly from asia harbors variants of the sgi1-j subgroup that are encountered mainly in the far east, as previously described for s. enterica serovars emek and virchow.

AB  == microbial infection is an obstacle of burn treatment. however, little is known on what types of microbial infection dominate in the burn center and how the dynamic change of those microorganisms occurs during the past several years in china. we  conducted a retrospective study of nosocomial infection (ni) in a large burn center to analyze the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of microbial isolates from january 2003 to december 2010. we studied 989 isolates from 677 patients who had signs and symptoms of infection 48h after admission. the number of nis per 100 admissions was 10.9. the commonest isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), and candida (11.4%). the result indicated that the numbers of patients with acinetobacter sp. infection increased (p=0.004), but with proteus mirabilis infection decreased (p=0.004). the isolated acinetobacter sp. and p. aeruginosa were consistently highly resistant to almost  all antibiotics tested. notably, more frequent acinetobacter sp. isolates appeared to be resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidim, piperacillin, tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin and more frequent escherichia coli isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam at the late time period although the p. aeruginosa and e. coli isolates were sensitive to less used ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. the increased rates of drug-resistant isolates in the later period might be associated with regular prophylactic therapy with antibiotics.

TI  == proteobacterial arfa peptides are synthesized from non-stop messenger rnas.
AB  == the translation of non-stop mrna (which lack in-frame stop codons) represents a significant quality control problem for all organisms. in eubacteria, the transfer-messenger rna (tmrna) system facilitates recycling of stalled ribosomes  from non-stop mrna in a process termed trans-translation or ribosome rescue. during rescue, the nascent chain is tagged with the tmrna-encoded ssra peptide, which promotes polypeptide degradation after release from the stalled ribosome. escherichia coli possesses an additional ribosome rescue pathway mediated by the  arfa peptide. the e. coli arfa message contains a hairpin structure that is cleaved by rnase iii to produce a non-stop transcript. therefore, arfa levels are controlled by tmrna through ssra-peptide tagging and proteolysis. here, we examine whether arfa homologues from other bacteria are also regulated by rnase iii and tmrna. we searched 431 arfa coding sequences for mrna secondary structures and found that 82.8% of the transcripts contain predicted hairpins in  their 3'-coding regions. the arfa hairpins from haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis, vibrio fischeri, and pasteurella multocida are all cleaved by rnase iii as predicted, whereas the hairpin from neisseria gonorrhoeae functions as an  intrinsic transcription terminator to generate non-stop mrna. each arfa homologue is ssra-tagged and degraded when expressed in wild-type e. coli cells, but accumulates in mutants lacking tmrna. together, these findings show that arfa synthesis from non-stop mrna is a conserved mechanism to regulate the alternative ribosome rescue pathway. this strategy ensures that arfa homologues are only deployed when the tmrna system is incapacitated or overwhelmed by stalled ribosomes.

TI  == type i and type ii mechanisms of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy: an in vitro  study on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background and objectives: antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) employs a non-toxic photosensitizer (ps) and visible light, which in the presence of oxygen produce reactive oxygen species (ros), such as singlet oxygen ((1) o(2), produced via type ii mechanism) and hydroxyl radical (ho(.), produced via type i mechanism). this study examined the relative contributions of (1) o(2) and ho(.)  to apdt killing of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. study design/materials and methods: fluorescence probes, 3'-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorescein (hpf) and singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (sosg) were used to determine ho(.) and (1) o(2) produced by illumination of two  ps: tris-cationic-buckminsterfullerene (bb6) and a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) (pei-ce6). dimethylthiourea is a ho(.) scavenger, while sodium azide (nan(3)) is a quencher of (1) o(2). both apdt and killing by fenton reaction (chemical generation of ho(.)) were carried out on gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). results: conjugate pei-ce6 mainly produced (1) o(2) (quenched by nan(3)), while bb6 produced ho(.) in addition to (1) o(2) when nan(3) potentiated probe activation. nan(3) also potentiated hpf activation by fenton reagent. all bacteria were killed by fenton reagent but gram-positive bacteria needed a higher concentration than gram-negatives. nan(3) potentiated fenton-mediated killing of  all bacteria. the ratio of apdt killing between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was 2 or 4:1 for bb6 and 25:1 for conjugate pei-ce6. there was a nan(3)  dose-dependent inhibition of apdt killing using both pei-ce6 and bb6 against gram-negative bacteria while nan(3) almost failed to inhibit killing of gram-positive bacteria. conclusion: azidyl radicals may be formed from nan(3) and ho(.). it may be that gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to ho(.) while  gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to (1) o(2). the differences in nan(3) inhibition may reflect differences in the extent of ps binding to bacteria (microenvironment) or differences in penetration of nan(3) into cell walls of bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary infections in taiwan: results from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart), 2006-2010.
AB  == we investigated the trends in antimicrobial resistance among species of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary tract infections  in taiwan during the period 2006-2010 as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart). during the study period, 1032 isolates of gram-negative bacilli that had been collected from patients with hepatobiliary infections were tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents in accordance with the clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. enterobacteriaceae accounted for the majority (n = 874, 84.7%) of isolates and escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (n = 323, 31.3%). there were significantly more e. coli (p = 0.001) and proteus mirabilis (p = 0.031) isolates collected from patients who had been hospitalized for less than 48 h and significantly more serratia marcescens (p = 0.035) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p  = 0.008) isolates collected from patients who had been hospitalized for 48 h or longer. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing pathogens was low. the decline in susceptibility rates with time was remarkable for ceftazidime (p = 0.036), ciprofloxacin (p = 0.029), and levofloxacin (p = 0.018). the most effective antibiotics, i.e., those that were active against more than 90% of enterobacteriaceae, were amikacin, cefepime, imipenem, ertapenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to anti-pseudomonal agents was greater than 80%. in this study, we found an overall increase in resistance to antimicrobial agents among gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary tract infections in taiwan. surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility and updates of treatment guidelines are recommended  to help achieve optimal therapy for patients with hepatobiliary infections.

TI  == epidemiology and genetics of ctx-m extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == ctx-m enzymes, the plasmid-mediated cefotaximases, constitute a rapidly growing family of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) with significant clinical impact. ctx-ms are found in at least 26 bacterial species, particularly in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. at least 109 members in ctx-m family are identified and can be divided into seven clusters based on their phylogeny. ctx-m-15 and ctx-m-14 are the most dominant variants. chromosome-encoded intrinsic cefotaximases in kluyvera spp. are proposed to be the progenitors of ctx-ms, while isecp1, iscr1 and plasmid are closely associated with their mobilization and dissemination.

AB  == the global spread of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (ndm) is of significant public health concern. this study sought to determine whether bla(ndm) was present in enterobacteriaceae isolates displaying resistance to carbapenems that  were submitted to the national antibiotic reference laboratory, institute of environmental science and research (porirua, new zealand) during 2009 and 2010. isolates were tested for the presence of beta-lactamase genes and 16s rrna methylase genes by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing. plasmid transfer studies were undertaken on isolates found to be harbouring bla(ndm). molecular typing was performed by multilocus sequence typing (mlst). the bla(ndm-1) gene was identified in four enterobacteriaceae isolates (two escherichia coli, one klebsiella pneumoniae and one proteus mirabilis) from four  patients in new zealand hospitals in 2009 and 2010. in addition, the bla(ndm-6) gene, which differed from bla(ndm-1) by a point mutation at position 698 (c-->t), was also identified in an e. coli isolate from the same patient who harboured the bla(ndm-1)-positive p. mirabilis. all four patients had recently been hospitalised or received health care in india. four of the isolates also produced a ctx-m-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and/or plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase, and all five isolates harboured the plasmid-mediated 16s rrna methylase rmtc gene. the e. coli types were diverse by mlst, and the k. pneumoniae isolate belonged to the internationally disseminated sequence type 11  (st11) clone. these findings further illustrate the diversity of phenotypic and genotypic features found in association with bla(ndm), in addition to documenting the international spread of this resistance mechanism, notably into a country with historically low rates of antimicrobial resistance.

AB  == mobile drug-resistance genes with identical nucleic acid sequences carried by multidrug-resistant escherichia coli strains that cause community-acquired infections are becomingly increasingly dispersed worldwide. over a 2-year period, we analysed gram-negative bacterial (gnb) pathogens from the blood of inpatients  at an urban public hospital to determine what proportion of these isolates carried such globally dispersed drug-resistance genes. of 376 gnb isolates, 167 (44 %) were escherichia coli, 50 (13 %) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 25 (7 %) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 25 (7 %) were proteus mirabilis and 20 (5 %) were enterobacter cloacae; the remainder (24 %) comprised 26 different gnb species. among e. coli isolates, class 1 integrons were detected in 64 (38 %). the most common integron gene cassette configuration was dfra17-aada5, found in 30 (25 %)  of 119 drug-resistant e. coli isolates and in one isolate of moraxella morganii.  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genes were found in 16 e. coli isolates (10 %). these genes with identical sequences were found in nearly 40 % of bloodstream e. coli isolates in the study hospital, as well as in a variety of bacterial species from clinical and non-clinical sources worldwide. thus, a substantial proportion of bloodstream infections among hospitalized patients were caused by e. coli strains carrying drug-resistance genes that are dispersed globally in a wide variety of bacterial species.

TI  == [diaper cystitis as recurrent cause of urinary infections in geriatric community  hospital].
AB  == aim: chronic cystitis in diaper-dependent elderly patients can be a causative pathology for recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) in community hospitals. methods: we analyzed hospital infections to determine causative organisms from january 2007 to december 2009 in patients in a long-term care hospital. the reading causes of hospital infections were utis (30.4%), aspiration pneumonia (cap; 26%) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap; 17.2%). of a total of 3,097 hospital infections over the investigation period, utis were the most common (n=940, 30.4%) followed by cap (n=809, 26%) and hap (n=533, 17.2%). of 278 utis in 2007, the causative strains were escherichia coli (n=106, 38%), enterococcus faecalis (n=44, 16%), proteus mirabilis (n=31, 11%), alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (n=22, 8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococcus (n=14, 5%). extended spectrum beta-lactamase (n=14, 13%) strains were noted in 106 patients with escherichia coli. we then retrospectively examined the records of 110 diaper dependent elderly patients, (medical words, n=52, mix-care wards, n=68) for utis  over the same study period. of these 16 (14.5%) had no utis at any time, 12 (11%) were infected 50% of the time, 17 (15.5%) were infected 51% to 99% of the time and 65 (59%) were infected 100% of the time. the uti rate was not correlated with bladder function or between the 2 wards. we treated bacterial cystitis with antibiotics for 3-5 days but these were unsuccessful. antiseptics worked temporarily, but recurrence or re-infection always occurred. it remains unknown if diapers are a potential cause of chronic cystitis in dependent elderly patients. the clinical dilemma of whether recurrent diaper cystitis should be treated and prohibit the growth and spread of drug-resistant strains, remains challenging.

TI  == extensive characterizations of bacteria isolated from catheterized urine and stone matrices in patients with nephrolithiasis.
AB  == background: urinary tract infections are generally known to be associated with nephrolithiasis, particularly struvite stone, in which the most common microbe found is urea-splitting bacterium, i.e. proteus mirabilis. however, our observation indicated that it might not be the case of stone formers in thailand. we therefore extensively characterized microorganisms associated with all types of kidney stones. methods: a total of 100 kidney stone formers (59 males and 41 females) admitted for elective percutaneous nephrolithotomy were recruited and microorganisms isolated from catheterized urine and cortex and nidus of their stones were analyzed. results: from 100 stone formers recruited, 36 cases had a total of 45 bacterial isolates cultivated from their catheterized urine and/or stone matrices. among these 36 cases, chemical analysis by fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy revealed that 8 had the previously classified 'infection-induced stones', whereas the other 28 cases had the previously classified 'metabolic stones'. calcium oxalate (in either pure or mixed form) was the most common and found in 64 and 75% of the stone formers with and without bacterial isolates, respectively. escherichia coli was the most common bacterium  (approximately one-third of all bacterial isolates) found in urine and stone matrices (both nidus and periphery). linear regression analysis showed significant correlation (r = 0.860, p < 0.001) between bacterial types in urine and stone matrices. multidrug resistance was frequently found in these isolated bacteria. moreover, urea test revealed that only 31% were urea-splitting bacteria, whereas the majority (69%) had negative urea test. conclusions: our data indicate that microorganisms are associated with almost all chemical types of kidney stones and urea-splitting bacteria are not the major causative microorganisms found in urine and stone matrices of the stone formers in thailand. these data may lead to rethinking and a new roadmap for future research regarding the role of microorganisms in kidney stone formation.

TI  == microbiological and mucociliary properties of the ethanol extract of hymenocardia acida on selected respiratory clinical isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial property of the ethanol leaf extract of hymenocardia acida (h.  acida) on some opportunistic respiratory pathogens was evaluated in this study. we also assessed the activity of the extract on tracheal mucociliary activity using murine tracheal mucus exudation and mucociliary motility in pigeons as experimental models. phytochemical screening of the extract was done; and acute toxicity of the extract in mice was carried out using lorke's method for estimation of its median lethal dose. results show the presence of carbohydrates, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, resins, and balsams in the extract and  the absence of anthraquinones, terpenes, and sterols. results of the acute toxicity test showed that the extract was slightly toxic, with an estimated median lethal dose of 1,767.77 mg/kg body weight. at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body  weight of h. acida, tracheal mucus exudation was increased by 14.29, 19.24, and 33.82%, respectively. the effect on mucociliary velocity was dose-dependent as 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight of the extract led to increased ciliary activity by 7.69, 61.5, and 81.6%, respectively. the effects of the extract (200  mg/kg body weight) on mucus exudation and clearance were significant (p < .05) and higher than the effect of ammonium chloride. although the extract did not inhibit the growth of c. albicans and k. pneumoniae, it exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. these findings show the mucociliary activity and antimicrobial properties of h. acida ethanol extract, and justify its use in the treatment of airway disorders.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of 6,296 enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates collected at a tertiary care university hospital in greece.
AB  == the reevaluation of "forgotten" antibiotics can identify new therapeutic options  against extensively drug-resistant gram-negative pathogens. we sought to investigate isepamicin in this regard. we retrospectively evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of enterobacteriaceae sp. isolates from unique patients, collected at the microbiological laboratory of the university hospital of heraklion, crete, greece, from 2004 to 2009. susceptibility testing was done with the automated vitek 2 system. the breakpoints for susceptibility to isepamicin, tigecycline, and other antibiotics  were those proposed by the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (ca-sfm), the fda, and the clsi, respectively. a total of 6,296 isolates were studied, including primarily 3,401 (54.0%) escherichia coli, 1,040  (16.5%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 590 (9.4%) proteus mirabilis, and 460 (7.3%) enterobacter sp. isolates. excluding the species with intrinsic resistance to each antibiotic, antimicrobial susceptibility was highest for colistin (5,275/5,441 isolates [96.9%]) and isepamicin (6,103/6,296 [96.9%]), followed by  meropenem (5,890/6,296 [93.6%]), imipenem (5,874/6,296 [93.3%]), and amikacin (5,492/6,296 [87.2%]). the antimicrobial susceptibility of the 1,040 k. pneumoniae isolates was highest for isepamicin (95.3%), followed by colistin (89.3%) and meropenem (63.0%). regarding resistant k. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to isepamicin was observed for 91.1% of the 392, 87.7% of the 375, and 85.6% of the 111 isolates that were nonsusceptible to the carbapenems, all other aminoglycosides, and colistin, respectively. isepamicin exhibited high in vitro activity against almost all of the enterobacteriaceae species. it could particularly serve as a last-resort therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae in our region, where it is endemic, as it does not show considerable cross-resistance with other aminoglycosides.

TI  == discovery and characterization of coturnix chinensis avian beta-defensin 10, with broad antibacterial activity.
AB  == a novel avian beta-defensin (avbd), avbd10, was discovered in the liver and bone  marrow tissues from chinese painted quail (coturnix chinensis) in the present study. the complete nucleotide sequence of quail avbd10 contains a 207-bp open reading frame that encodes 68 amino acids. the quail avbd10 was expressed widely  in all the tissues from quails except the tongue, crop, breast muscle, and thymus and was highly expressed in the bone marrow. in contrast to the expression pattern of avbd10 in tissues from quail, the chicken avbd10 was expressed in all  21 tissues from the layer hens investigated, with a high level of expression in the kidney, lung, liver, bone marrow, and harderian glands. recombinant glutathione s-transferase (gst)-tagged avbd10s of both quail and chicken were produced and purified by expression of the two cdnas in escherichia coli, respectively. in addition, peptide according to the respective avbd10s sequence was synthesized, named synthetic avbd10s. as expected, both recombinant gst-tagged avbd10s and synthetic avbd10s of quail and chicken exhibited similar bactericidal properties against most bacteria, including gram-positive and gram-negative forms. however, no significant bactericidal activity was found for  quail recombinant gst-tagged avbd10 against salmonella choleraesuis or for chicken recombinant gst-tagged avbd10 against proteus mirabilis.

TI  == antiadhesive activity of the biosurfactant pseudofactin ii secreted by the arctic bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens bd5.
AB  == background: pseudofactin ii is a recently identified biosurfactant secreted by pseudomonas fluorescens bd5, the strain obtained from freshwater from the arctic  archipelago of svalbard. pseudofactin ii is a novel compound identified as cyclic lipopeptide with a palmitic acid connected to the terminal amino group of eighth  amino acid in peptide moiety. the c-terminal carboxylic group of the last amino acid forms a lactone with the hydroxyl of thr3. adhesion is the first stage of biofilm formation and the best moment for the action of antiadhesive and anti-biofilm compounds. adsorption of biosurfactants to a surface e.g. glass, polystyrene, silicone modifies its hydrophobicity, interfering with the microbial adhesion and desorption processes. in this study the role and applications of pseudofactin ii as a antiadhesive compound has been investigated from medicinal and therapeutic perspectives. results: pseudofactin ii lowered the adhesion to three types of surfaces (glass, polystyrene and silicone) of bacterial strains of five species: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis and two candida albicans strains. pretreatment of a polystyrene surface with 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin ii inhibited bacterial adhesion by 36-90% and that of c. albicans by 92-99%. the same concentration of pseudofactin ii dislodged 26-70% of preexisting biofilms grown on previously untreated surfaces. pseudofactin ii also caused a marked inhibition of the initial adhesion of e. faecalis, e. coli, e. hirae and c. albicans strains to silicone urethral catheters. the highest concentration tested (0.5 mg/ml) caused a total growth inhibition of s. epidermidis, partial (18-37%) inhibition of other bacteria and 8-9% inhibition of c. albicans growth. conclusion: pseudofactin ii showed antiadhesive activity against several pathogenic microorganisms which are potential biofilm formers on catheters, implants and internal prostheses. up to 99% prevention could be achieved by 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin ii. in addition, pseudofactin ii dispersed preformed biofilms. pseudofactin ii can be used as a disinfectant or surface coating agent against microbial colonization of different surfaces, e.g. implants or urethral catheters.

AB  == the worldwide dissemination of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)- and carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae is a major concern in both hospital and community settings. rapid identification of these resistant pathogens and the genetic determinants they possess is needed to assist in clinical practice and epidemiological studies. a collection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and proteus mirabilis isolates, including phenotypically esbl-positive (n = 1,093) and esbl-negative isolates (n = 59), obtained in 2008-2009 from a longitudinal surveillance study (smart) was examined using an in vitro nucleic acid-based microarray. this approach was used to detect and identify bla(esbl) (bla(shv), bla(tem), and bla(ctx-m) genes of groups 1, 2, 9, and 8/25) and bla(kpc) genes and was combined with selective pcr amplification and dna sequencing for complete characterization of the bla(esbl) and bla(kpc) genes. of the 1,093 phenotypically esbl-positive isolates, 1,041 were identified  as possessing at least one bla(esbl) gene (95.2% concordance), and 59 phenotypically esbl-negative isolates, used as negative controls, were negative.  several esbl variants of bla(tem) (n = 5), bla(shv) (n = 11), bla(ctx-m) (n = 19), and bla(kpc) (n = 3) were detected. a new bla(shv) variant, bla(shv-129), and a new bla(kpc) variant, bla(kpc-11), were also identified. the most common bla genes found in this study were bla(ctx-m-15), bla(ctx-m-14), and bla(shv-12). using nucleic acid microarrays, we obtained a "molecular snapshot" of bla(esbl) genes in a current global population; we report that ctx-m-15 is still the dominant esbl and provide the first report of the new beta-lactamase variants bla(shv-129) and bla(kpc-11).

TI  == rapid detection of urinary tract pathogens using microcalorimetry: principle, technique and first results.
AB  == what's known on the subject? and what does the study add? microcalorimetry has been applied in several microbiological studies, but never in a clinical urological context. in addition, basic knowledge on the growth of urinary pathogens in urine is still scarce and data regarding the growth rate of many urinary pathogens in urine are still not available. the study demonstrates that this innovative application of microcalorimetry is useful in (i) investigating the growth of urinary pathogens in sterilized urine and (ii) as a rapid tool for  diagnosis of urinary infection as well as for further identification of the causative infectious agent. objective: to investigate the value of isothermal microcalorimetry (imc) in the detection and differentiation of common urinary tract pathogens in urine. imc is a non-specific analytical tool for the measurement of heat in the microwatt range. patients and methods: a microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. detection was accomplished,  and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in sterilized urine at 37 degrees c by measuring metabolic heat flow (microw = microj/s) as a function of time. the strains were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. results: bacterial growth was detected after 3.1 to 17.1 h with decreasing inocula. the detection limit was 1 colony-forming unit (cfu)/ml for e. coli, 10 cfu/ml for p. mirabilis and e. faecalis and 10(3) cfu/ml for s. aureus. the total heat was highest in p. mirabilis ranging from 10 to 12 j, followed by e. coli (3-4 j), s. aureus (2-3 j) and e. faecalis (1.3-1.5 j). the shape of the heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. conclusions: imc allows rapid detection of bacteriuria, much faster than conventional culture. urinary tract pathogen detection after only 3.1 h is realistic. clearly different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen differentiation. due to expeditious identification of urine samples that contain only low colony counts (i.e. less than 10(3) cfu/ml),  imc may become a valuable screening tool for detecting the presence of significant bacteriuria.

TI  == [epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases of iasi, romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  == infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. the aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. material and methods: a retrospective study was conducted between january 2008 and december 2010 at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. results: from 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). there were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated,  being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative staphylococci (14/18,66%), enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group b streptococcus (3/4%), streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), aerococcus viridans, streptococcus equi, klebsiella pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, sphyngomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of s. aureus. among 16 invazive strains of e. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. there were no e.  coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. the mean mortality rate was 14,66%. conclusions: the high level of resistance of s. aureus and e. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.

TI  == multi-centre evaluation of a phenotypic extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection guideline in the routine setting.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the routine setting performance of a guideline for phenotypic detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in enterobacteriaceae, recommending esbl confirmation with etest or combination disc for isolates with a positive esbl screen test (i.e. cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime mic >1 mg/l or an automated system esbl warning). twenty laboratories submitted 443 enterobacteriaceae with a positive esbl screen test and their confirmation test result (74%escherichia coli, 12%enterobacter cloacae, 8%klebsiella pneumoniae, 3%proteus mirabilis, 2%klebsiella oxytoca). presence of esbl genes was used as reference test. accuracy of local phenotypic esbl detection was 88%.  the positive predictive value (ppv) of local screen tests was 70%, and differed per method (vitek-2: 69%, phoenix: 68%, disc diffusion: 92%), and species (95%k.  pneumoniae-27%k. oxytoca). a low ppv (3%) was observed for isolates with automated system alarm but third-generation cephalosporin mics <2 mg/l. local esbl confirmation had a ppv and negative predictive value (npv) of 93% and 90%, respectively. compared with centrally performed confirmation tests, 7% of local tests were misinterpreted. combination disc was more specific than etest (91% versus 61%). confirmation tests were not reliable for p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca (ppv 33% and 38%, respectively, although npvs were 100%). in conclusion, performance of etests could be enhanced by education of technicians to improve their interpretation, by genotypic esbl confirmation of p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca isolates with positive phenotypic esbl confirmation, and by interpreting  isolates with a positive esbl alarm but an mic <2 mg/l for cefotaxime and ceftazidime as esbl-negative.

TI  == french results of the aresc study: clinical aspects and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in female patients with cystitis. implications for empiric therapy.
AB  == objective: uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most frequent community infections. we report the french results of the international aresc study on the  clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. patient and methods: female patients between 18 and 65 years of age, with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis, were investigated clinically with urinalysis  and urine culture. uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility was tested with nine antimicrobials. results: four thousand and four hundred patients were included, 871 in france, forming the largest national cohort. urine culture  was positive (cfu>/=10(4)/ml) in 550 (63.1%); 533 (96.9%) presented with a single bacterium infection. 488 uropathogens, collected from 479 patients, were analyzed. the most frequent were: escherichia coli (83.8%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (3.1%), enterococci (1.2%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1.0%). e. coli was highly susceptible to fosfomycin (99.0%) (97.1%), nitrofurantoin (97.3%), and ciprofloxacin (98.3%). the lowest susceptibility rates were found for ampicillin (60.9%) and cotrimoxazole (87.8%). fosfomycin (97.8%), ciprofloxacin (98.3%), and nitrofurantoin (91.5%) had the highest susceptibility rate. the lowest susceptibility rates were observed with ampicillin (61.4%) and cotrimoxazole (86.5%). conclusions: fosfomycin, pivmecillinam (not available in france), and nitrofurantoin have preserved their  in vitro activity and are suitable for empiric therapy. cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) and fluoroquinolones are not usually recommended  as first intention drugs for the empiric therapy of uncomplicated cystitis, because of increasing resistance rates.

TI  == antiquorum sensing and antibiofilm potential of capparis spinosa.
AB  == background: emergence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens often leads to the failure of existing antibiotics to treat bacterial infections; thus, there is a need to seek alternative treatment measures. the aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-quorum sensing (anti-qs) and antibiofilm potential of capparis spinosa to prevent the onset of bacterial infections as an alternate to  antibiotics. methods: the methanolic extract of the dried fruits of c. spinosa was assessed for its activity in inhibiting qs-depedent phenomenon such as violacein pigment production in chromobacterium violaceum, biosurfactant production in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, swimming and swarming motility, exopolysaccharide production (eps) and biofilm formation in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and pao1. results: extract of c. spinosa showed a higher degree of anti-qs activity in a dose dependent manner without affecting the bacterial growth. at 2 mg/ml, this extract significantly (p </=0.005) inhibited the biofilm formation to 79, 75, 73, 70% and eps production to 58, 46, 66 and 67% in s. marcescens, pao1, e. coli and p. mirabilis, respectively. it also exhibited inhibition in swimming and swarming motility of bacterial pathogens. the non-enzymatic nature of the anti-qs compound in c. spinosa was confirmed by proteinase k and heat treatment. conclusions: because the methanolic extract of c. spinosa demonstrated anti-qs and antibiofilm activity at 0.5-2 mg/ml, it could be further exploited for novel molecules to treat the emerging infections of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections in south african hospitals (smart study 2004-2009): impact of the new carbapenem breakpoints.
AB  == background: the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) follows trends in resistance among aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (gnb) isolated from complicated intra-abdominal infections  (ciais) in patients around the world. methods: during 2004-2009, three centralized clinical microbiology laboratories serving 59 private hospitals in three large south african cities collected 1,218 gnb from complicated intra-abdominal infections (ciais) and tested them for susceptibility to 12 antibiotics according to the 2011 clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi)  guidelines. results: enterobacteriaceae comprised 83.7% of the isolates. escherichia coli was the species isolated most commonly (46.4%), and 7.6% of these were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-positive. the highest esbl rate was documented for klebsiella pneumoniae (41.2%). overall, ertapenem was the antibiotic most active against susceptible species for which it has breakpoints (94.6%) followed by amikacin (91.9%), piperacillin-tazobactam (89.3%), and imipenem-cilastatin (87.1%), whereas rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin were documented to be 29.7%, 28.7%, 22.5%, and 21.1%, respectively. multi-drug resistance (mdr), defined as resistance to three or more antibiotic classes, was significantly more common in  k. pneumoniae (27.9%) than in e. coli (4.9%; p<0.0001) or proteus mirabilis (4.1%; p<0.05). applying the new clsi breakpoints for carbapenems, susceptibility to ertapenem was reduced significantly in esbl-positive e. coli compared with esbl-negative isolates (91% vs. 98%; p<0.05), but this did not apply to imipenem-cilastatin (95% vs. 99%; p=0.0928). a large disparity between imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem susceptibility in p. mirabilis and morganella morganii was documented (24% vs. 96% and 15% vs. 92%, respectively), as most isolates of these two species had imipenem-cilastatin minimum inhibitory concentrations in the 2-4 mcg/ml range, which is no longer regarded as susceptible. conclusions: this study documented substantial resistance to standard antimicrobial therapy among gnb commonly isolated from ciais in south africa. with the application of the new clsi carbapenem breakpoints, discrepancies were noted between ertapenem and imipenem-cilastatin with regard to the changes in their individual susceptibilities. longitudinal surveillance of susceptibility patterns is useful to guide recommendations for empiric antibiotic use in ciais.

TI  == radial and spiral stream formation in proteus mirabilis colonies.
AB  == the enteric bacterium proteus mirabilis, which is a pathogen that forms biofilms  in vivo, can swarm over hard surfaces and form a variety of spatial patterns in colonies. colony formation involves two distinct cell types: swarmer cells that dominate near the surface and the leading edge, and swimmer cells that prefer a less viscous medium, but the mechanisms underlying pattern formation are not understood. new experimental investigations reported here show that swimmer cells in the center of the colony stream inward toward the inoculation site and in the  process form many complex patterns, including radial and spiral streams, in addition to previously-reported concentric rings. these new observations suggest  that swimmers are motile and that indirect interactions between them are essential in the pattern formation. to explain these observations we develop a hybrid model comprising cell-based and continuum components that incorporates a chemotactic response of swimmers to a chemical they produce. the model predicts that formation of radial streams can be explained as the modulation of the local  attractant concentration by the cells, and that the chirality of the spiral streams results from a swimming bias of the cells near the surface of the substrate. the spatial patterns generated from the model are in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.

TI  == [characteristic of fluoroquinolone resistant clinical isolates of k. pneumoniae,  p. mirabilis and e. coli producing esbl and ampc beta-lactamases].
AB  == introduction: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are the predominant mechanism for acquired antibiotic resistance in enterobacteriaceae. during the past few years, increasing occurrence of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases (pampcs) particularly in k. pneumonia, p. mirabilis and e. coli was reported. therefore, the aim of our study was to analyse of the diversity of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as pampcs and esbls among clinical k. pneumonia, p. mirabilis and e. coli strains in poland. methods: a total of 19 clinical enterobacteriaceae strains (e. coli, n = 9; k. pneumoniae, n = 7; p. mirabilis, n = 3) resistant to third-generation cephalosporin were selected from  collection of fluoroquinolone resistant isolates recovered during a 6-months period in regular hospital in warsaw, poland. esbls and ampcs were detected by using phenotypic methods: double-disc tests (ddsts), mast id d68c test, sensitivity to cefoxitin, disk potentiation test (dpt) and tris-edta test. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of the bla(ampc), bla(ctm-m), bla(tem), and bla(shv), genes. pcr-products for these genes were sequenced. to determine the possible clonality of the tested isolates pfge with the xbai was performed. results: nine of 19 fluoroquinolone-resistant strains tested produced  extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of tem, shv and ctx-m families. these esbls were most commonly detected in e. coli. ampc beta-lactamases were produced by 6 tested strains, including 3 isolates of p. mirabilis. the ampc found in our study belonged to cmy and dha families, furthermore, 4 isolates of k. pneumoniae were found to co-produce both esbl and ampc beta-lactamases. xbai-pfge profiles pointed significant differences of tested strains. conclusion: horizontal transfer of genes encoding for acquired beta-lactamases such esbl and ampc seem to play primary role in dissemination of these resistance traits among fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical strains of enterobacteriaceae in poland.

TI  == influence of quorum sensing signal molecules on biofilm formation in proteus mirabilis o18.
AB  == the influence of basis of quorum sensing molecules on proteus strains is much less known as compared to pseudomonas or escherichia. we have previously shown that a series of acylated homoserine lactones (acyl-hsl) does not influence the ureolytic, proteolytic, or hemolytic abilities, and that the swarming motility of proteus mirabilis rods is strain specific. the aim of the presented study was to  find out if the presence of a series of acyl-hsl influences biofilm formation of  p. mirabilis laboratory strain belonging to o18 serogroup. this serogroup is characterized by the presence of a unique non-carbohydrate component, namely phosphocholine. escherichia coli and p. mirabilis o18 strains used in this work contains cloned plasmids encoding fluorescent protein genes with constitutive gene expression. in mixed biofilms in stationary and continuous flow conditions,  p. mirabilis o18 overgrow whole culture. p. mirabilis o18 strain has genetically  proved a presence of ai-2 quorum sensing system. differences in biofilm structure were observed depending on the biofilm type and culture methods. from tested acylated homoserine lactones (bhl, hhl, ohl, dhl, ddhl, tdhl), a significant influence had bhl on thickness, structure, and the amount of exopolysaccharides produced by biofilms formed by p. mirabilis o18 pdsred(2).

TI  == a self-loading microfluidic device for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics.
AB  == this article describes a portable microfluidic technology for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of antibiotics against bacteria. the microfluidic platform consists of a set of chambers molded in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms) that are preloaded with antibiotic, dried, and reversibly sealed to a second layer of pdms containing channels that connect the  chambers. the assembled device is degassed via vacuum prior to its use, and the absorption of gas by pdms provides the mechanism for actuating and metering the flow of fluid in the microfluidic channels and chambers. during the operation of  the device, degas driven flow introduces a suspension of bacterial cells, dissolves the antibiotic, and isolates cells in individual chambers without cross contamination. the growth of bacteria in the chambers in the presence of a ph indicator produces a colorimetric change that can be detected visually using ambient light. using this device we measured the mic of vancomycin, tetracycline, and kanamycin against enterococcus faecalis 1131, proteus mirabilis hi4320, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli mg1655 and report values that are comparable to standard liquid broth dilution measurements. the device provides a  simple method for mic determination of individual antibiotics against human pathogens that will have applications for clinical and point-of-care medicine. importantly, this device is designed around simplicity: it requires a single pipetting step to introduce the sample, no additional components or external equipment for its operation, and provides a straightforward visual measurement of cell growth. as the device introduces a novel approach for filling and isolating  dead-end microfluidic chambers that does not require valves and actuators, this technology should find applications in other portable assays and devices.

AB  == objective: to examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, hemigraphis colorata (h. colorata) leaves and stem and elephantopus scaber (e. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected  pathogens. methods: the fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. the dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 ml of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for  preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. results: the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum  ether extracts e. scaber leaves, flower and root and h. colorata leaves and stem  demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the  above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. the results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of h. colorata leaves and stem. the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts e. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). the root ethanolic extracts of e. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) (24 mm), escherichia coli (e. coli) (16 mm) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) (13 mm). the chlorofrom extracts of e. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against bacillus cereus (b. cereus) (12 mm), the leaves ethanolic extracts of e.  scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz.,  enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) (18 mm), proteus mirabilis (p. mirabilis) (17 mm), salmonella typhi (s. typhi) (14 mm) and enterobacter sp. (11 mm) while the benzene extracts of h. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and s. aureus (12 mm). conclusions: it is  hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative organisms from intraabdominal infections and evolution of isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases in the smart study in spain (2002-2010).
AB  == introduction: the smart (study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends) surveillance study records the antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacilli obtain from intraabdominal infections with special focus in isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). material and methods: the antimicrobial susceptibility of 8,869 isolates was analyzed by microdilution during the smart study performed in spain from 2002 to 2010. isolates were recovered in 16 centres. results: escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen (60.9% from intraabdominal infections acquired in the community and 49.9% in those from nosocomial origin) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.9% vs 9.2%). pseudomonas aeruginosa was more common in intraabdominal infections from nosocomial origin (5.6% community and 8.6% nosocomial). frequency of esbl-producing isolates was: e. coli, 8.7%; k. pneumoniae, 8.4%; klebsiella oxytoca, 1.4%; and proteus mirabilis, 1.6%. overall, esbl-producing isolates were more frequently isolated from elderly patients (6.8% >60 years). ertapenem and meropenem were the most active antimicrobials (susceptibility range with eucast criteria, 89.0-100%) when considering all enterobacteriaceae isolates and also against esbl producers (95.5-100%). susceptibility of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam was lower, particularly among esbl-producing isolates. nevertheless, ertapenem maintained a good activity (susceptibility >95%) in esbl-producers that were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam or fluoroquinolones. conclusions: antimicrobial susceptibility data from the smart-spain study reinforce current therapeutic guidelines of intraabdominal infections that include ertapenem as the empirical choice for treatment. this is also supported by the high frequency of esbl-producers in our geographic area.

TI  == plasmid-mediated transfer of the bla(ndm-1) gene in gram-negative rods.
AB  == the latest threat of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria corresponds to the emergence of carbapenemase ndm-1 (new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase) producers, mostly in enterobacteriacae. five bla(ndm) (-1) -positive plasmids of  different incompatibility groups (incl/m, fii, a/c and two untypeable plasmids) from clinical enterobacteriaceae were evaluated for conjugation properties and host specificity. successful conjugative transfers were obtained using all tested enterobacterial species as recipients (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium and proteus mirabilis) and all plasmid types. conjugation  frequencies varied from 1 x 10(-4) to 6 x 10(-8) transconjugants per donor. higher conjugation rates were obtained for two plasmids at 30 degrees c compared  with that observed at 25 and 37 degrees c. carbapenems used as selector did not lead to higher conjugation frequencies. none of the five plasmids was transferable to acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa by conjugation. this work underlines how efficient the spread of the carbapenemase bla(ndm) (-1)  gene could be among enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteremias in the emergency department.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria have been spreading from hospitals to communities. despite this, there are limited emergency department (ed) patient-based studies about these bacteremias. a retrospective matched case-control study with a ratio of 1:3 was conducted at a university hospital. the case group consisted of patients aged >16 years with esbl-producing bacteremias in the ed. patients matched for age and sex with non-esbl-producing bacteremias were sampled as the control group. finally, 64 episodes of esbl-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis bacteremias were included in our study. the median age of case patients was 71 years, and 29 (45.3%) were males. the most common type of infection was urinary tract infection (71.9%), followed by intra-abdominal infection (12.5%). inappropriate empirical antibiotics therapy was prescribed in 87.5% of case patients, which was significantly higher than the control group (13.0%; p < 0.001). patients with inappropriate empirical antibiotics had a significantly longer hospital stay than those with appropriate empirical antibiotics (p < 0.001). multivariate analysis showed that hospital-acquired infection, urinary catheterization, and previous antibiotics use were independent risk factors for the acquisition of esbl-producing bacteremia. the 28-day mortality rate of case patients was 18.8%. whether they received appropriate empirical antibiotics treatment or not, there was no statistical difference in the mortality of patients with esbl-producing bacteremias (p = 0.167). to face these emerging multidrug-resistant bacteria and to guide the empirical antibiotics therapy, it is crucial for emergency physicians to recognize the characteristics and risk factors for esbl-producing organisms.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance pattern for gram-negative uropathogens isolated from hospitalised patients and outpatients in cartagena, 2005-2008].
AB  == objective: determining the microbial aetiology spectrum and antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitalised patients and outpatients. methods: a descriptive study was carried out between february 2005 and november 2008 at the san buenaventura university's clinical laboratory in cartagena. antibiotic sensitivity was determined by the kirby bauer method. results: out of the total specimens (1,384) analysed over the four-year study period, 455 of the urine samples (32.9 %) were culture positive, most (81.4 %) having come from females. the bacterium isolated most frequently was escherichia  coli (60.1 %) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (6.9 %), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.6 %), proteus mirabilis (5.4 %) and acinetobacter baumannii (1.4 %). the gram-negative isolates displayed a high level of resistance to ampicillin (range  84.3100 %), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (range 66.580 %) and ciprofloxacin (range 4057.9 %). conclusion: gram-negative bacteria were responsible for urinary tract  infections in the patients involved in this study. the most commonly isolated bacteria were e. coli. empirical administration of a third-generation cephalosporin for initial treatment of urinary tract infections in this population appears prudent from the perspective of antimicrobial susceptibility.

TI  == molecular mimicry between spermatozoa and bacteria.
AB  == purpose: sperm immobilization factor isolated from staphylococcus aureus immobilizes human spermatozoa as well as motile bacteria, showing that sperm immobilization factor receptor might be shared by bacteria and human spermatozoa. thus, we sought to identify a common sperm immobilization factor binding receptor on spermatozoa and bacteria. materials and methods: sperm immobilization factor was isolated from s. aureus. sperm immobilization factor binding receptors were isolated from spermatozoa and bacteria. results: antisperm antibodies in humans cross-reacted with bacteria antibodies. thus, molecular similarities between determinants of spermatozoa and pathogenic microorganisms can be inferred. sperm  immobilization factor isolated from s. aureus immobilized spermatozoa (150 mug/ml) and motile bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis (500 mug/ml). this showed the presence of a common sperm immobilization factor binding conformation on spermatozoa and bacteria. furthermore, receptors binding sperm immobilization factor were extracted and purified from spermatozoa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. molecular mimicry between spermatozoa and bacteria was confirmed by observing the blockage  of spermatozoa immobilization by sperm immobilization factor in the presence of receptors isolated from spermatozoa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa or p. mirabilis. also, a higher concentration of sperm immobilization factor (200 mug/ml) caused sperm death. blocking the death of spermatozoa induced by sperm immobilization factor in the presence of these receptors provided further evidence for a common  receptor. conclusions: results provide evidence for molecular similarity between  bacteria and spermatozoa.

TI  == inhibition of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis adhesion and biofilm formation on medical grade silicone surface.
AB  == silicone has been utilized extensively for biomedical devices due to its excellent biocompatibility and biodurability properties. however, its surface is  easily colonized by bacteria which will increase the probability of nosocomial infection. in the present work, a hydrophilic antimicrobial carboxymethyl chitosan (cmcs) layer has been grafted on medical grade silicone surface pre-treated with polydopamine (pda). the increase in hydrophilicity was confirmed from contact angle measurement. bacterial adhesion tests showed that the pda-cmcs coating reduced the adhesion of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis by >/= 90%. the anti-adhesion property was preserved even after the aging of the functionalized surfaces for 21 days in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), and also  after autoclaving at 121 degrees c for 20 min. both e. coli and p. mirabilis readily form biofilms on the pristine surface under static and flow conditions but with the pda-cmcs layer, biofilm formation is inhibited. the flow experiments indicated that it is more difficult to inhibit biofilm formation by the highly motile p. mirabilis as compared to e. coli. no significant cytotoxicity of the modified substrates was observed with 3t3 fibroblasts.

TI  == impact of adopting minimum inhibitory concentration as the determinant of susceptibility to cephalosporins and carbapenems in multi-drug resistant enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the clinical and laboratory standards institute has recommended that enterobacteriaceae susceptibility to most cephalosporins and carbapenems be reported according to minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) alone. we analyzed our record of multi-drug resistant enterobacteriaceae to assess the impact of these changes. we compared susceptibilities of ceftriaxone-resistant enterobacteriaceae when using the 2009 and new 2010 mic standards. vitek2(r) (biomerieux), was used to assess the changes in susceptibility. klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., and escherichia coli were the major species from urine,  sputum, blood, and other sterile sites. the new breakpoint for cephalosporins increased resistance in e. coli and p. mirabilis. many proteus categorized as resistant by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) detection or inferred resistance have mics to ceftriaxone </= 1 mcg/ml. new carbapenem breakpoints increased resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. the increased ceftriaxone resistance from lowering breakpoints was almost balanced by the loss  of resistance in esbl isolates with mics </= 1 mcg/ml. mic-based susceptibility for multi-drug resistant enterobacteriaceae increases the number of resistant isolates. inferring mechanisms of resistance has a disproportionate effect on the susceptibility of proteus mirabilis to cephalosporins, and the mic-based standard has an almost equivalent but opposite effect on proteus mirabilis susceptibility  to carbapenems.

TI  == susceptibility of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae according to the new clsi breakpoints.
AB  == in 2010 the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) lowered the susceptibility breakpoints of some cephalosporins and aztreonam for enterobacteriaceae and eliminated the need to perform screening for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and confirmatory tests. the aim of this study was to determine how many esbl-producing strains of three common species of enterobacteriaceae test susceptible using the new breakpoints. as determined with the clsi screening and confirmatory tests, 382 consecutive esbl-producing strains were collected at huashan hospital between 2007 and 2008, including 158 strains of escherichia coli, 164 of klebsiella pneumoniae, and 60 of proteus mirabilis. susceptibility was determined by the clsi agar dilution method. ctx-m-, tem-, and shv-specific genes were determined by pcr amplification and sequencing. bla(ctx-m) genes alone or in combination with bla(shv) were present in 92.7% (354/382) of these esbl-producing strains. forty-two (25.6%) strains of k. pneumoniae harbored shv-type esbls alone or in combination. no tem esbls were found. utilizing the new breakpoints, all 382 strains were resistant to cefazolin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, while 85.0 to 96.7% of p. mirabilis strains tested susceptible to ceftazidime, cefepime, and aztreonam, 41.8 to 45.6% of e. coli strains appeared to be susceptible to ceftazidime and cefepime, and 20.1% of k. pneumoniae were susceptible to cefepime. in conclusion, all esbl-producing strains of enterobacteriaceae would be reported to be resistant to cefazolin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone by using the new clsi breakpoints, but a substantial number of esbl-containing p. mirabilis and e. coli strains would be reported to be susceptible to ceftazidime, cefepime, and aztreonam, which is likely due to the high prevalence of ctx-m type esbls.

TI  == self-transmissibility of the integrative and conjugative element icepm1 between clinical isolates requires a functional integrase, relaxase, and type iv secretion system.
AB  == integrative and conjugative elements (ices), which are chromosomal mobile elements, can conjugatively transfer between bacteria. recently, we identified a  genomic island of proteus mirabilis, a common agent of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (uti), that possesses all the properties consistent with  an ice. this element, designated icepm1, is highly conserved in other causative agents of uti, suggesting its mobility. we demonstrate that icepm1 can actively excise from the chromosome in a clonal population of bacteria and that this excision is integrase dependent. although in p. mirabilis hi4320, icepm1 is annotated as integrated into the phenylalanine trna gene phev, we show that icepm1 can integrate into either phev or pheu. we determined that icepm1 transfers at a frequency of 1.35 x 10(-5) transconjugants/donor to icepm1-deficient p. mirabilis using plate mating assays with clinical isolates. insertional inactivation of a putative integrase gene on icepm1 decreased transfer frequencies of icepm1 to below the limit of detection. mutation of the relaxase of icepm1 also eliminates transfer and demonstrates that this element is indeed self-transmissible and not transferred in trans, as are some mobilizable genomic islands. together, these findings clearly demonstrate that icepm1 can actively excise from the chromosome in an integrase-dependent manner, dynamically integrate into both phenylalanine trna genes, and transfer into clinical strains  using its own conjugation machinery.

TI  == recognition of dna by the helix-turn-helix global regulatory protein lrp is modulated by the amino terminus.
AB  == the asnc/lrp family of regulatory proteins links bacterial and archaeal transcription patterns to metabolism. in escherichia coli, lrp regulates approximately 400 genes, over 200 of them directly. in earlier studies, lrp genes from vibrio cholerae, proteus mirabilis, and e. coli were introduced into the same e. coli background and yielded overlapping but significantly different regulons. these differences were seen despite amino acid sequence identities of 92% (vibrio) and 98% (proteus) to e. coli lrp, including complete conservation of the helix-turn-helix motifs. the n-terminal region contains many of the sequence  differences among these lrp orthologs, which led us to investigate its role in lrp function. through the generation of hybrid proteins, we found that the n-terminal diversity is responsible for some of the differences between orthologs in terms of dna binding (as revealed by mobility shift assays) and multimerization (as revealed by gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation). these observations indicate that the n-terminal  tail plays a significant role in modulating lrp function, similar to what is seen for a number of other regulatory proteins.

TI  == molecular analysis of ndm-1-producing enterobacterial isolates from geneva, switzerland.
AB  == objectives: to analyse the mechanisms responsible for decreased susceptibility or resistance to carbapenems in several enterobacterial isolates recovered in 2009-10 in geneva university hospitals, switzerland. methods: pcr and sequencing  were used to identify beta-lactamases, 16s rna methylases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes. the transferable properties of the plasmids were analysed, as well as their plasmid type. the strains were typed by multilocus sequence typing. results: three patients were found to be positive for ndm-1-producing enterobacterial isolates (one with escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, one with k. pneumoniae only and one with proteus mirabilis), where ndm-1 stands for new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1. the bla(ndm-1) carbapenemase gene was detected in all isolates in addition to genes encoding narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases (tem-1, shv-11, oxa-1, oxa-9 and oxa-10), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ctx-m-15, cmy-16 and cmy-30), arma and quinolone resistance determinants (qnr). the bla(ndm-1) gene was located on conjugative inca/c- or incf-type plasmids. upstream of the bla(ndm-1) gene, part  of isaba125, previously identified in ndm-1-negative acinetobacter baumannii, was found. downstream of the bla(ndm-1) gene, variable sequences were found. conclusions: this work constitutes the first identification of ndm-1 producers in switzerland. interestingly, patients from whom these ndm-1-producing isolates were recovered had a link with the indian subcontinent or the balkans.

TI  == new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1: local acquisition in ontario, canada, and challenges in detection.
AB  == new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) is a recently identified metallo-beta-lactamase that confers resistance to carbapenems and all other beta-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of aztreonam. ndm-1 is also associated with resistance to many other classes of antibiotics. the enzyme was first identified in organisms isolated from a patient in sweden who had previously received medical treatment in india, but it is now recognized as endemic throughout india and pakistan and has spread worldwide. the gene encoding ndm-1 has been found predominantly in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. we describe the isolation ndm-1-producing organisms from two patients in toronto, ontario. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an organism producing ndm-1 that was locally acquired in canada. we also discuss the evidence that ndm-1 can affect bacterial species other than e. coli and k. pneumoniae, the limited options for treatment and the difficulty laboratories face in detecting organisms that produce ndm-1.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in urinary tract pathogens in canada from 2007 to 2009:  canward surveillance study.
AB  == from january 2007 to december 2009, an annual canadian national surveillance study (canward) tested 2,943 urinary culture pathogens for antimicrobial susceptibilities according to clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. the most frequently isolated urinary pathogens were as follows (number of isolates, percentage of all isolates): escherichia coli (1,581, 54%),  enterococci (410, 14%), klebsiella pneumoniae (274, 9%), proteus mirabilis (122,  4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (100, 3%), and staphylococcus aureus (80, 3%). the rates of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (sxt) were 78, 86, 84, and 93%, respectively, for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and s. aureus. the rates of susceptibility to nitrofurantoin were 96, 97, 33, and 100%, respectively, for e. coli, enterococci, k. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. the rates of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were 81, 40, 86, 81, 66, and 41%, respectively, for e. coli, enterococci, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus. statistical analysis of resistance rates (resistant plus intermediate isolates) by year for e. coli over the 3-year study period demonstrated that increased resistance rates occurred only for amoxicillin-clavulanate (from 1.8 to 6.6%; p < 0.001) and for sxt (from 18.6 to 24.3%; p = 0.02). for isolates of e. coli, in a multivariate logistic regression  model, hospital location was independently associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin (p = 0.026) with higher rates of resistance observed in inpatient areas (medical, surgical, and intensive care unit wards). increased age was also  associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin (p < 0.001) and with resistance to two or more commonly prescribed oral agents (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and sxt) (p = 0.005). we conclude that frequently  prescribed empirical agents for urinary tract infections, such as sxt and ciprofloxacin, demonstrate lowered in vitro susceptibilities when tested against  recent clinical isolates.

TI  == identifying patients harboring extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae on hospital admission: derivation and validation of a scoring  system.
AB  == increases in community-acquired infections caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae have important implications for hospital infection control and empirical antibiotic therapy protocols. we developed and validated a tool for identifying patients harboring these organisms at hospital admission. we retrospectively analyzed chart data for 849 adult inpatients. the derivation cohort included 339 patients  admitted to a large hospital in rome during 2008, with (n = 113) or without (n =  226) culture positivity for esbl-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., or  proteus mirabilis within 48 h after admission. logistic-regression-based prediction scores were calculated based on variables independently associated with the outcome. the model was validated in a second cohort (n = 510) selected with identical criteria in hospitals in genoa and turin during 2009. prediction scores were based on the following six variables (reported with odds ratio for study outcome and the 95% confidence intervals in brackets): recent (</= 12 months before admission) hospitalization (5.69 [2.94 to 10.99]), transfer from another health care facility (5.61 [1.65 to 19.08]), charlson comorbidity score >/= 4 (3.80 [1.90 to 7.59]), recent (</= 3 months before admission) beta-lactam and/or fluoroquinolone treatment (3.68 [1.96 to 6.91]), recent urinary catheterization (3.52 [1.96 to 6.91]), and age >/= 70 years (3.20 [1.79 to 5.70]). the model displayed good calibration and good-to-excellent discrimination in the derivation and validation sets (hosmer-lemshow chi(2) = 15.28 and 14.07; p = 0.17 and 0.23; areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.83 and 0.92). it reliably identified patients likely to be harboring esbl-producing  enterobacteriaceae at hospital admission who may need special infection control measures. further study is needed to confirm this model's potential as a guide for prescribing empirical antibiotic therapy.

TI  == transcriptome of proteus mirabilis in the murine urinary tract: virulence and nitrogen assimilation gene expression.
AB  == the enteric bacterium proteus mirabilis is a common cause of complicated urinary  tract infections. in this study, microarrays were used to analyze p. mirabilis gene expression in vivo from experimentally infected mice. urine was collected at 1, 3, and 7 days postinfection, and rna was isolated from bacteria in the urine for transcriptional analysis. across nine microarrays, 471 genes were upregulated and 82 were downregulated in vivo compared to in vitro broth culture. genes upregulated in vivo encoded mannose-resistant proteus-like (mr/p) fimbriae, urease, iron uptake systems, amino acid and peptide transporters, pyruvate metabolism enzymes, and a portion of the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle enzymes.  flagella were downregulated. ammonia assimilation gene glna (glutamine synthetase) was repressed in vivo, while gdha (glutamate dehydrogenase) was upregulated in vivo. contrary to our expectations, ammonia availability due to urease activity in p. mirabilis did not drive this gene expression. a gdha mutant was growth deficient in minimal medium with citrate as the sole carbon source, and loss of gdha resulted in a significant fitness defect in the mouse model of urinary tract infection. unlike escherichia coli, which represses gdha and upregulates glna in vivo and cannot utilize citrate, the data suggest that p. mirabilis uses glutamate dehydrogenase to monitor carbon-nitrogen balance, and this ability contributes to the pathogenic potential of p. mirabilis in the urinary tract.

AB  == objective: previously, it was shown that ozone and s-methylthiourea (smt) treatments had ameliorative effects on experimental models of acute necrotizing pancreatitis (anp). it is possible that the combination of ozone and smt may be more effective than either therapy. therefore, we investigated the efficacy of combination therapy with ozone and smt in an experimental rat model of anp. material and methods: sprague-dawley rats were divided into five experimental groups. groups were designed as sham-operated, anp, anp + ozone, anp + smt and anp + ozone + smt. a model of anp was induced by injection of sodium taurocholate into the common biliopancreatic duct. four days after induction, blood and tissue samples were obtained for biochemical, microbiological and histopathological analysis. results: survival rates, serum amylase, lipase and neopterin levels, tissue oxidative stress parameters, bacterial translocation and tissue injury scores were better in the ozone and smt groups than in the anp group. there was no bacterial translocation in the ozone-treated groups. tissue injury scores in the ozone group were better compared to all anp induced groups. ozone and smt treatment in combination did not have better biochemical, microbiological and histological data compared to ozone or smt treatments separately in experimental  anp. conclusions: the combination of ozone and smt did not provide any therapeutic advantage in anp possibly because smt inhibited nitric oxide synthesis which was needed for ozone action.

TI  == urine cultures from indwelling bladder catheters in nursing home patients: a point prevalence study in a swedish county.
AB  == objectives: to survey the bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance in urinary strains from patients with indwelling bladder catheters residing in nursing homes within a geographically defined region. material and methods: urine was sampled for culture from 163 catheter patients (126 men and 37 women) during a 2 week period in march 2010. susceptibility testing of the isolated bacteria was compared with all urinary strains (n = 9994) from hospitals and primary healthcare in the same geographical area cultured during the first 6 months of 2010 (control group). results: bacteriuria was found in 159 of 163 urine samples  (98%). enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli were the most common species, one or both being detected in 72% of the urine samples, while proteus species were found in10% and a single isolate of providentia species was seen.strains in  the study patients were more resistant to antibiotics than in the control group.  particularly large differences were noted for ciprofloxacinin in e. coli (16.9% vs 7.9%) and for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in e. faecalis (39.1% vs 24.8%). one extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing e. coli was cultured (1.3%), compared with 1.6% in the control group. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were detected. conclusions: proteus mirabilis and providentia species were rarely isolated, in sharp contrast to previous studies from geriatric hospital wards where they have often been in the majority. the limited incidence of esbl and the absence of vre and mrsa is gratifying, but the high resistance to antibiotics needs to be assessed on a continuous basis.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility pattern of urinary tract pathogens in ibadan, nigeria.
AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) affect all age groups and occur in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals and have serious impact on the socioeconomic life of the individual and the society, and also account for a large proportion of antibacterial drug consumption. treatment failure has been attributed to increasing resistance to common antibiotics, but there is paucity of data from this part of nigeria. this prospective study was carried out to determine the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of uropathogens in ibadan using standard microbiological diagnostic methods. statistical analysis was by simple percentages among related variables. four hundred and nine urinary  isolates, 239 (58.4%) and 170 (41.6%) from hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients respectively were studied. frequency of occurrence of urinary pathogens  were klebsiella spp 171 (41.8%), pseudomonas species (including pseudomonas aeruginosa) 81 (19.8%), escherichia coli 78 (19.1%), staphylococcus aureus 31 (7.6%) and proteus mirabilis 31 (7.6%). resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin 97%, tetracycline 93%, cotrimoxazole 98%, and amoxycillin 89%  was observed among most uropathogens. seventy-five to 100% pseudomonas spp. were  resistant to the common antibiotics and also 87.1% and 82.4% were resistant to nalidixic acid and cefuroxime respectively. however, appreciable susceptibility by all uropathogens was found with amikacin 75%, ciprofloxacin 72.2%, ceftriaxone 68.4%, and pefloxacin 64.9%. isolates from the community showed more susceptibility to tested drugs. in conclusion, widespread resistance to most antibiotics including cephalosporins and quinolones was found among all uropathogens.

TI  == escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter, and proteus
AB  == the gram-negative bacilli of the genera escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter,and proteus(table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. with the exception of proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. a limited number of  species, including e coli, k pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, s marcescens,and p mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. the increasing incidence of the coliforms, proteus, and other gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better  understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (r factors). also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host  defenses.

TI  == relationship between the camp levels in leukocytes and the cytokine balance in patients surviving gram negative bacterial pneumonia.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide-stimulated leukocytes secrete proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-12. over-activation of host defense systems may result in severe tissue damage and requires regulation. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-10 are candidate cytokines  for inducing tolerance to lipopolysaccharide re-stimulation. we compared cytokines secreted by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood cells from patients who had survived gram negative bacterial pneumonia (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis, n = 26) and age-matched healthy volunteers (n = 18). interleukin-12p70 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression was significantly lower in patients (p = 0.0039 and p<0.001) compared to healthy controls, while granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production was markedly higher in patients (p<0.001). levels of interleukin-10 were comparable. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor expression was inversely correlated with interleukin-12p70 (r = -0.71, p<0.001) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (r = -0.64, p<0.001) expression; interleukin-10 showed no significant correlation. in  unstimulated leukocytes from patients, camp levels were significantly raised (p = 0.020) and were correlated inversely with interleukin-12p70 levels (r = -0.81, p<0.001) and directly with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (r = 0.72, p = 0.0020), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (r = 0.67, p = 0.0067) and interleukin-10 (r  = 0.54, p = 0.039) levels. our results demonstrate that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated leukocytes  is a useful indicator of tolerance induction in surviving pneumonia patients and  that measuring camp in freshly isolated leukocytes may also be clinically significant.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

AB  == although the designer proline-rich antimicrobial peptide a3-apo has only modest activity against escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro, in mouse  models of systemic and wound infections it shows superior efficacy compared with  conventional antibiotics. in this study, the efficacy of a3-apo in several additional mouse models was investigated, including staphylococcus aureus wound infection, mixed klebsiella pneumoniae-a. baumannii-proteus mirabilis wound infection and k. pneumoniae lung infection, mimicking blast wound infections, foot ulcers and ventilator-induced nosocomial infections, respectively. whilst the peptide practically did not kill the strains in vitro, when administered intramuscularly or as an aerosol it significantly improved mouse survival and reduced bacterial counts at the infection site and in blood. in the lung infection study, the blood bacterial counts following a3-apo treatment were as low as after treatment with colistin and were lower than after treatment with imipenem or amikacin. the wounds of treated animals, unlike their untreated counterparts, lacked pus and signs of inflammation. in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a3-apo upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 by four- to six-fold. one of the mechanisms mediating the in vivo protective effects might be the prevention of inflammation around bacterial infiltration.

TI  == expression and characterization of a second l-amino acid deaminase isolated from  proteus mirabilis in escherichia coli.
AB  == l-amino acid deaminases catalyze the deamination of natural l-amino acids. two types of l-amino acid deaminase have been identified in proteus species. one exhibits high levels of activity toward a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic l-amino acids, typically l-phenylalanine, whereas the other acts on a relatively  narrow range of basic l-amino acids, typically l-histidine. in this study, we cloned, expressed, and characterized a second amino acid deaminase, termed pm1, from p. mirabilis kctc 2566. homology alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of pm1 demonstrated that the greatest similarity (96%) was with the l-amino acid deaminase (lad) of p. vulgaris, and that homology with pma was relatively low (72%). also, similar to lad, pm1 was most active on l-histidine, indicating that pm1 belongs to the second type of amino acid deaminase. in agreement with this conclusion, the v(max) and k(m) values of pm1 were 119.7 (mug phenylpyruvic acid/mg/min) and 31.55 mm phenylalanine, respectively, values lower than those of pma. the pml deaminase will be very useful industrially in the preparation of commercially valuable materials including urocanic acid and alpha-oxoglutarate.

TI  == the salmonella genomic island 1 is specifically mobilized in trans by the inca/c  multidrug resistance plasmid family.
AB  == background: the salmonella genomic island 1 (sgi1) is a salmonella enterica-derived integrative mobilizable element (ime) containing various complex multiple resistance integrons identified in several s. enterica serovars and in proteus mirabilis. previous studies have shown that sgi1 transfers horizontally by in trans mobilization in the presence of the inca/c conjugative helper plasmid pr55. methodology/principal findings: here, we report the ability of different prevalent multidrug resistance (mdr) plasmids including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) gene-carrying plasmids to mobilize the multidrug resistance genomic island sgi1. through conjugation experiments, none of the 24 conjugative  plasmids tested of the incfi, fii, hi2, i1, l/m, n, p incompatibility groups were able to mobilize sgi1 at a detectable level (transfer frequency <10(-9)). in our  collection, esbl gene-carrying plasmids were mainly from the inchi2 and i1 groups and thus were unable to mobilize sgi1. however, the horizontal transfer of sgi1 was shown to be specifically mediated by conjugative helper plasmids of the broad-host-range inca/c incompatibility group. several conjugative inca/c mdr plasmids as well as the sequenced inca/c reference plasmid pra1 of 143,963 bp were shown to mobilize in trans sgi1 from a s. enterica donor to the escherichia  coli recipient strain. depending on the inca/c plasmid used, the conjugative transfer of sgi1 occurred at frequencies ranging from 10(-3) to 10(-6) transconjugants per donor. of particular concern, some large inca/c mdr plasmids  carrying the extended-spectrum cephalosporinase bla(cmy-2) gene were shown to mobilize in trans sgi1. conclusions/significance: the ability of the inca/c mdr plasmid family to mobilize sgi1 could contribute to its spread by horizontal transfer among enteric pathogens. moreover, the increasing prevalence of inca/c plasmids in mdr s. enterica isolates worldwide has potential implications for the epidemic success of the antibiotic resistance genomic island sgi1 and its close derivatives.

TI  == the nationwide study of bacterial pathogens associated with urinary tract infections conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy.
AB  == this study was conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy and is the first nationwide study on bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections at 28 hospitals throughout japan between january 2008 and june 2008. a total of 688 bacterial strains were isolated from adult patients with urinary tract infections. the strains investigated in this study are as follows: enterococcus faecalis (n = 140), escherichia coli (n = 255), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 93), proteus mirabilis (n = 42), serratia marcescens (n = 44), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 114). the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 39 antibacterial agents used for these strains were determined according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) manual. all enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. although a majority of the e. faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid, 11 strains (7.8%) were found to be intermediately resistant. the proportions of fluoroquinolone-resistant enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and s. marcescens strains were 35.7%, 29.3%, 18.3%, and 15.2%, respectively. the proportions of e. coli, p. mirabilis, k. pneumoniae, and s. marcescens strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were 5.1%, 11.9%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. the proportions of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones were 9.2%, 4.4%,  and 34.8%, respectively, and among them, 2 strains (1.8%) were found to be multidrug resistant. these data present important information for the proper treatment of urinary tract infections and will serve as a useful reference for periodic surveillance studies in the future.

TI  == unexpected coregulator range for the global regulator lrp of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the lrp/asnc family of transcription factors links gene regulation to metabolism  in bacteria and archaea. members of this family, collectively, respond to a wide  range of amino acids as coregulators. in escherichia coli, lrp regulates over 200 genes directly and is well known to respond to leucine and, to a somewhat lesser  extent, alanine. we focused on lrp from proteus mirabilis and e. coli, orthologs  with 98% identity overall and identical helix-turn-helix motifs, for which a previous study nevertheless found functional differences. sequence differences between these orthologs, within and adjacent to the amino acid-responsive ram domain, led us to test for differential sensitivity to coregulatory amino acids.  in the course of this investigation, we found, via in vivo reporter fusion assays and in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift experiments, that e. coli lrp itself  responded to a broader range of amino acids than was previously appreciated. in particular, for both the e. coli and p. mirabilis orthologs, lrp responsiveness to methionine was similar in magnitude to that to leucine. both lrp orthologs are also fairly sensitive to ile, his, and thr. these observations suggest that lrp ties gene expression in the enterobacteriaceae rather extensively to physiological status, as reflected in amino acid pools. these findings also have  substantial implications for attempts to model regulatory architecture from transcriptome measurements or to infer such architecture from genome sequences, and they suggest that even well-studied regulators deserve ongoing exploration.

TI  == salmonella genomic islands and antibiotic resistance in salmonella enterica.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in several salmonella enterica serovars that cause gastrointestinal disease in humans is due to a set of related genomic islands carrying a class 1 integron, which carries the resistance genes. salmonella genomic island 1 (sgi1), the first island of this type, was found in s. enterica  serovar typhimurium dt104 isolates, which are resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, streptomycin, spectinomycin, sulfonamides and tetracycline. several salmonella serovars and proteus mirablis have since been shown to harbor sgi1 or related islands carrying various sets of resistance genes and some distinct groups have emerged. sgi1 is an integrative mobilizable element and can be transferred experimentally into escherichia coli. however, within serovars, isolates recovered from different parts of the world appear to be clonal, indicating that sgi1 movement may be rare. potential reservoirs in food-producing animals or in ornamental fish have been identified for some serovars.

TI  == emergence of klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing proteus mirabilis in hangzhou, china.
AB  == background: carbapenems are used to treat severe infections caused by multi-drug-resistant organisms, however, the emergence of carbapenem-resistant bacterial isolates is becoming an increasing therapeutic challenge. since the first klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing k. pneumoniae was  reported in 2001, kpc-producing isolates have been found increasingly, specially  in enterobacteriaceae. the aim of this study was to characterize the mechanisms of a carbapenem-resistant proteus (p.) mirabilis. methods: a carbapenem-resistant p. mirabilis isolate was recovered from pleural drainage fluid of a patient admitted to surgical intensive care unit. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolate was performed by disk diffusion according to clinical and laboratory  standards institute guidelines, and subsequent minimal inhibitory concentrations  were determined with the e-test. amplification of the bla(kpc) gene generated a positive band and the pcr products were sequenced subsequently. the plasmid of the isolate was extracted and was successfully transformed into escherichia (e.)  coli dh5alpha. results: the p. mirabilis isolate was resistant to all detected antimicrobial agents except tigecycline. kpc-2 was confirmed by dna sequence analysis. the transformant e. coli was resistant to carbapenems. further study demonstrated that upstream and downstream regions of bla(kpc-2) were identical to that observed in k. pneumoniae submitted to genbank from china in 2007. conclusion: carbapenem resistance in the p. mirabilis isolate in this study is mainly due to production of kpc-2.

TI  == occurrence of gram-negative bacteria in hens' eggs depending on their source and  storage conditions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the qualitative composition of gram-negative microbes, mainly of the family enterobacteriaceae, including pathogenic bacteria  such as salmonella, in the albumens and yolks and on the shells of hens' eggs, depending on their source and on the temperature and duration of their storage. a total of 375 table eggs were studied, from a large-scale poultry farm, a small-scale poultry farm and a supermarket. each group was divided into 5 subgroups according to the temperature and duration of their storage during the study. two serotypes of bacteria of the genus salmonella were identified: s. enteritidis and s. arizonae. strains of salmonella spp. were also isolated. apart from salmonella and escherichia coli, among the most frequently isolated bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae were enterobacter spp., klebsiella spp. and citrobacter freundii. qualitative analysis of the bacterial microflora of the eggs also showed the presence of other gram negative bacteria, including acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas spp., tatumella ptyseos, providencia stuartii, serratia liquefaciens, flavimonas oryzihabitans, vibrio metschnikovii, leclercia  adecarboxylata, kluyvera spp., rahnella aquatilis, proteus mirabilis, and achromobacter spp. the study demonstrated that the conditions applied, i.e., the  temperature and duration of storage, did not significantly influence the prevalence of particular species of gram-negative bacteria in the eggs. however,  based on the analysis of contamination of eggs with salmonella depending on their source, it can be concluded that the system in which the hens are housed affects  the risk of contamination of eggs with these pathogens.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in gram negative bacteria.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are a group of plasmid-mediated, diverse, complex and rapidly evolving enzymes that are posing a major therapeutic challenge today in the treatment of hospitalized and community-based patients. infections due to esbl producers range from uncomplicated urinary tract infections to life-threatening sepsis. derived from the older tem is derived from temoniera, a patient from whom the strain was first isolated in greece. beta-lactamases, these enzymes share the ability to hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam and yet are inhibited by clavulanic acid. in addition, esbl-producing organisms exhibit co-resistance to many other classes of antibiotics, resulting in limitation of therapeutic option. because of inoculum effect and substrate specificity, their detection is also a major challenge. at present, however, organizations such as the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) provide guidelines for the detection of esbls in klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. in common to all esbl-detection  methods is the general principle that the activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins against esbl-producing organisms will be enhanced by the presence  of clavulanic acid. carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to esbl-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant isolates have recently been reported. esbls represent an impressive example of the ability of gram-negative bacteria to develop new antibiotic-resistance mechanisms in the  face of the introduction of new antimicrobial agents. thus there is need for efficient infection-control practices for containment of outbreaks; and intervention strategies, e.g., antibiotic rotation to reduce further selection and spread of these increasingly resistant pathogens.

AB  == the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria in japan are very low ( approximately 5%) compared with those obtained worldwide. further, the current trend of these bacteria in japan is not known, and few studies with longitudinal observations have been reported. to obtain epidemiologic data on esbl-producing bacteria, their genotypic features, and their antibiotic resistance patterns in japan, we analyzed bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients at our institution over the 7-year period from 2003 to 2009. of 2,304 isolates, 202 (8.8%) were found to be esbl producers, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, and proteus mirabilis. the detection rates of the esbl-producing isolates gradually increased and reached 17.1% and 10.5% for the e. coli and k. pneumoniae strains, respectively, in 2009. genotyping analysis showed that approximately 90% of the esbl-producing isolates  carried the ctx-m genotype, in which the ctx-m-9 group was predominant, although  the ctx-m-2 group is considered to be the main genotype in japan; further, many of the strains produced multiple beta-lactamases. the detection rates of esbl-producing bacteria may tend to be high within a limited region in japan. a countrywide survey is required to understand the trend for esbl-producing bacteria at the national level. in addition, our findings suggest that the genotypes of the detected esbl producers are similar to those exhibiting a successful nosocomial spread worldwide.

TI  == bacterial contamination of ram semen, antibiotic sensitivities, and effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c.
AB  == this study was designed to determine the degree and type of bacterial contamination of ejaculated semen samples in fertile rams and its consequences on sperm quality during storage. in experiment 1, 68 ejaculates from 36 rams were divided into two aliquots, one of which was used for bacterial culture, while the other one was diluted, stored at 15 degrees c and assessed for plasma membrane integrity and motility at 0, 24 and 48h after dilution. from the 68 ejaculates, 66 were positive for aerobic bacteria, including 20 species of bacteria from 14 genera. the most frequently isolated bacteria were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermis, and staphylococcus aureus species. these 5 bacteria were present in 97% of all contaminated samples. all contaminant bacteria were found to be sensitive to gentamicin and to ceftiofur, with variable percentages of resistance to the other antibiotics evaluated. in samples with total enterobacteria count lower than 100 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml, higher proportions of motile and progressive sperm and higher velocities of spermatozoa were observed at different times during storage. in experiment 2, pure cultures of the most frequently isolated bacteria  were individually added to fresh semen samples of low contamination and tested for their effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c. semen with e.  coli showed a drastic reduction in motility, velocity and viability during storage. this reduction was also significant, but less drastic, in semen with e.  cloacae and p. mirabilis, whereas it was partial and less pronounced in the other groups (s. epidermidis and s. aureus). in conclusion, the contamination of ram semen with enterobacterial species reduced sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c, and the antibiotics gentamicin and ceftiofur showed the higher antimicrobial activities.

TI  == structural basis of na(+)-independent and cooperative substrate/product antiport  in cait.
AB  == transport of solutes across biological membranes is performed by specialized secondary transport proteins in the lipid bilayer, and is essential for life. here we report the structures of the sodium-independent carnitine/butyrobetaine antiporter cait from proteus mirabilis (pmcait) at 2.3-a and from escherichia coli (eccait) at 3.5-a resolution. cait belongs to the family of betaine/carnitine/choline transporters (bcct), which are mostly na(+) or h(+) dependent, whereas eccait is na(+) and h(+) independent. the three-dimensional architecture of cait resembles that of the na(+)-dependent transporters leut and  betp, but in cait a methionine sulphur takes the place of the na(+) ion to coordinate the substrate in the central transport site, accounting for na(+)-independent transport. both cait structures show the fully open, inward-facing conformation, and thus complete the set of functional states that describe the alternating access mechanism. eccait contains two bound butyrobetaine substrate molecules, one in the central transport site, the other in an extracellular binding pocket. in the structure of pmcait, a tryptophan side chain occupies the transport site, and access to the extracellular site is blocked. binding of both substrates to cait reconstituted into proteoliposomes is cooperative, with hill coefficients up to 1.7, indicating that the extracellular  site is regulatory. we propose a mechanism whereby the occupied regulatory site increases the binding affinity of the transport site and initiates substrate translocation.

TI  == prevalence of microorganisms of hygienic interest in an organized abattoir in mumbai, india.
AB  == background: the magnitude of food-borne illnesses in india is unknown because of  lack of surveillance networks. monitoring the prevalence of food-borne pathogens  and indicators of contamination in primary production at abattoirs is imperative  for creating a data bank and for effective control of such pathogens before they  enter the food chain. methodology: microorganisms of hygienic interest were screened for their prevalence at deonar abattoir, mumbai. swab samples from 96 sheep/goat carcass sites were collected and analyzed for staphylococcus spp., bacillaceae, clostridiaceae and enterobacteriaceae. results: average staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis counts were 3.15 +/- 0.18 and 3.46 +/- 0.17 log10 cfu/cm(2), respectively. bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis and clostridium spp. counts were 3.10 +/- 0.08, 3.41 +/- 0.19 and 0.76 +/- 0.06 log10 cfu/cm(2), respectively. the escherichia coli count was 3.54 +/- 0.06 and the klebsiella aerogenes count was 3.22 +/- 0.22 log10 cfu/cm(2). counts for proteus vulgaris and proteus mirabilis were 3.44 +/- 0.14 log10 cfu/cm(2) and 3.71 +/- 0.12 log10 cfu/cm(2), respectively. s. epidermidis had the highest percentage prevalence at (41.6%), followed by k. aerogenes (31.9%), b. subtilis (28.2%) and p. vulgaris (23.6%). salmonella spp. were not isolated. conclusions:  the data demonstrate high prevalence and diversity of micro flora on carcasses in the primary indian production facility, which might be attributed to either human handling or improper dressing especially during evisceration process. appropriate training for personal and production hygiene is essential for workers in indian meat production facilities.

TI  == adhesion, invasion, and agglutination mediated by two trimeric autotransporters in the human uropathogen proteus mirabilis.
AB  == fimbriae of the human uropathogen proteus mirabilis are the only characterized surface proteins that contribute to its virulence by mediating adhesion and invasion of the uroepithelia. pmi2122 (aipa) and pmi2575 (taap) are annotated in  the genome of strain hi4320 as trimeric autotransporters with "adhesin-like" and  "agglutinating adhesin-like" properties, respectively. the c-terminal 62 amino acids (aa) in aipa and 76 aa in taap are homologous to the translocator domains of yada from yersinia enterocolitica and hia from haemophilus influenzae. comparative protein modeling using the hia three-dimensional structure as a template predicted that each of these domains would contain four antiparallel beta sheets and that they formed homotrimers. recombinant aipa and taap were seen as approximately 28 kda and approximately 78 kda, respectively, in escherichia coli, and each also formed high-molecular-weight homotrimers, thus supporting this model. e. coli synthesizing aipa or taap bound to extracellular matrix proteins with a 10- to 60-fold-higher level of affinity than the control strain.  inactivation of aipa in p. mirabilis strains significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the mutants' ability to adhere to or invade hek293 cell monolayers, and the functions were restored upon complementation. a 51-aa-long invasin region in the aipa passenger domain was required for this function. e. coli expressing taap mediated autoagglutination, and a taap mutant of p. mirabilis showed significantly (p < 0.05) more reduced aggregation than hi4320. gly-247 in aipa and gly-708 in taap were indispensable for trimerization and activity. aipa and taap individually offered advantages to p. mirabilis in a murine model. this is the first report characterizing trimeric autotransporters in p. mirabilis as afimbrial surface adhesins and autoagglutinins.

TI  == identification and characterization of a phospholipase a2 from the venom of the saw-scaled viper: novel bactericidal and membrane damaging activities.
AB  == phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)), a common toxic component of snake venom, has been implicated in various pharmacological effects. in this study, a basic myotoxic pla(2), named ectx-i was isolated from echis carinatus snake venom by using gel filtration on superdex g-75, and reverse phase hplc on c18 and c8 sepharose columns. pla(2), ectx-i was 13,861.72 molecular weight as estimated by maldi-tof  (15 kd by sds-page), and consisted of 121 amino acid residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. the n-terminal sequences revealed significant homology with basic myotoxic pla(2)s from other snake venoms. the purified pla(2) ectx-i was evaluated (250 mug/ml) for bactericidal activity of a wide variety of human pathogens against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw&tes), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. ectx-i showed strong antibacterial activity against b. pseudomallei (khw) and e. aerogenes among the tested bacteria. other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria showed only a moderate effect. however,  the gram-positive bacterium e. aerogenes failed to show any effect on ectx-i protein at tested doses. the most significant bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of ectx-i was observed at mics of >15 mug/ml against (b. pseudomallei, khw) and mics >30 mug/ml against e. aerogenes. mechanisms of bactericidal and membrane damaging effects were proved by ultra-structural analysis. ectx-i was able to induce cytotoxicity on thp-1 cells in vitro as well as lethality in balb/c mice. ectx-i also induced mild myotoxic effects on mouse skin, but was devoid of hemolytic effects on human erythrocytes up to 500 mug/ml. it is shown that the toxic effect induced by e. carinatus venom is due to the presence of myotoxic pla(2) (ectx-i). the result also corroborates the hypothesis of an association between toxic and enzymatic domains. in conclusion, ectx-i displays a heparin binding c-terminal region, which is probably responsible for the cytotoxic and bactericidal effects.

TI  == seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd  in southern brazil.
AB  == the seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd grown in southern brazil was analyzed by gc-ms, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. the yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. the results obtained from principal components analysis (pca) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. the samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. samples collected during winter  contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). in autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. the observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. the essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus  mirabilis, morganella morganii, and enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), indicated  that s. aureus, b. subtilis, and candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest mic values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/ml, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/ml, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/ml, respectively.

TI  == [evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of microorganisms isolated from urine in the region of vale do sousa and tamega].
AB  == the urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary  tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. from february 2008 to january 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. from these cultures 1037 were positive. from this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. in bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. it was verified that the most frequent microorganism was escherichia coli, followed by proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. for antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. for klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. in conclusion, this study shows that escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae are the  three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. a periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to  help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == host-pathogen interactions in urinary tract infection.
AB  == the urinary tract is a common site of bacterial infections; nearly half of all women experience at least one urinary tract infection (uti) during their lifetime. these infections are classified based on the condition of the host. uncomplicated infections affect otherwise healthy individuals and are most commonly caused by uropathogenic escherichia coli, whereas complicated infections affect patients with underlying difficulties, such as a urinary tract abnormality or catheterization, and are commonly caused by species such as proteus mirabilis. virulence and fitness factors produced by both pathogens include fimbriae, toxins, flagella, iron acquisition systems, and proteins that function in immune  evasion. additional factors that contribute to infection include the formation of intracellular bacterial communities by e. coli and the production of urease by p. mirabilis, which can result in urinary stone formation. innate immune responses are induced or mediated by pattern recognition receptors, antimicrobial peptides, and neutrophils. the adaptive immune response to uti is less well understood. host factors tlr4 and cxcr1 are implicated in disease outcome and susceptibility, respectively. low levels of tlr4 are associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria while low levels of cxcr1 are associated with increased incidence of acute pyelonephritis. current research is focused on the identification of additional virulence factors and therapeutic or prophylactic targets that might be used in the generation of vaccines against both uropathogens.

AB  == background: urinary tract infections (utis) are a common source of bacterial infections in childhood. making a proper diagnosis is important but requires invasive urine collection techniques. we aimed to derive a clinical decision rule to identify non-toilet-trained febrile girls at high risk for utis to restrict urethral catheterizations (ucs) to this high-risk group of patients. methods: we  included all non-toilet-trained girls with a positive microscopic urinalysis from urine collected by sterile bag in a prospective cohort study to derive a model to predict uti assessed by urine culture from uc. results: thirty-seven patients were included. absence of another source of fever on examination and the child's  unusual behaviour were found to be independent predictors of uti. the corresponding model offered an 85% sensitivity [95% confidence interval (ci): 56-96], with a 59% specificity (95% ci: 30-83) for uti. the internal cross-validation by bootstrap led to an 85% sensitivity (95% ci: 68-100), and a 59% specificity (95% ci: 35-83). conclusion: we derived a clinical decision model to selectively identify young febrile girls at high risk for uti with a positive  microscopic analysis and propose uc with an 85% sensitivity, which would avoid approximately 60% of unnecessary ucs; although further validation is necessary before daily clinical use.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == chromosomally encoded blacmy-2 located on a novel sxt/r391-related integrating conjugative element in a proteus mirabilis clinical isolate.
AB  == integrating conjugative elements (ices) are mobile genetic elements that can transfer from the chromosome of a host to the chromosome of a new host through the process of excision, conjugation, and integration. although sxt/r391-related  ices, originally demonstrated in vibrio cholerae o139 isolates, have become prevalent among v. cholerae isolates in asia, the prevalence of the ices among gram-negative bacteria other than vibrio spp. remains unknown. in addition, sxt/r391-related ices carrying genes conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have never been described. here we carried out a genetic analysis  of a cefoxitin-resistant proteus mirabilis clinical isolate, tum4660, which revealed the presence of a novel sxt/r391-related ice, icepmijpn1. icepmijpn1 had a core genetic structure showing high similarity to that of r391 and carried xis  and int genes completely identical to those of r391, while an is10-mediated composite transposon carrying bla(cmy-2) was integrated into the ice. a nucleotide sequence identical to the 3' part of isecp1 was located upstream of the bla(cmy-2) gene, and other genes observed around bla(cmy-2) in earlier studies were also present. furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of hot spot 2 and hot spot 4 in icepmijpn1 showed high similarity to that of hot spot 2 in sxt(mo10) and with a part of the nucleotide sequence found in p. mirabilis atcc 29906, respectively. icepmijpn1 was successfully transferred to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and citrobacter koseri in conjugation experiments. these observations suggest that ices may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes among clinically relevant enterobacteriaceae, which warrants careful observation of the prevalence of ices, including sxt/r391-related ices.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production of selected gram-negative bacilli from two croatian hospitals: mystic study results.
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network that monitors the activity of meropenem and compares its activity with other broadspectrum antimicrobial agents. we now report the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents within the selective gram-negative pathogen groups from two croatian hospitals investigated between 2002-2007. a total of 1510 gram-negative pathogens were tested and the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution method according to  clsi.there was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis in both medical centers. high resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime (18%), cefepime (17%) and gentamicin (39%) are raising concern. acinetobacter baumannii turned out to be the most resistant gram-negative bacteria with 81% resistant to ceftazidime, 73% to cefepime, 69% to gentamicin and 71% to ciprofloxacin. almost  20% of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem, 13% to meropenem, 69% to gentamicin and 38% to ciprofloxacin.the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in e. coli was 10% and in k. pneumoniae 49%. pcr and sequencing of the amplicons revealed the presence of shv-5 in nine e. coli strains and additional tem-1 beta-lactamase five strains. five k. pneumoniae strains were positive for bla(shv-5 )gene. eight esbl positive enterobacter spp. strains were found to produce tem and ctx-m beta-lactamases. plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases were not found among k. pneumoniae, e. coli and enterobacter spp. three a. baumannii strains from zagreb university center were identified by multiplex pcr as oxa-58 like producers. six a. baumannii strains from split university center were found to possess an isaba1 insertion sequence upstream of bla(oxa-51 )gene. according to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. these data indicate that despite continued use of meropenem, carbapenem resistance is not increasing among species tested, except for a. baumannii, in the two study hospitals and suggest that clinicians can still administer carbapenems as a reliable and effective choice in managing serious nosocomial infections.

TI  == prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in type 2 diabetic subjects with and without microalbuminuria.
AB  == background: diabetic subjects, especially women, show high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (asb). the aim of the present study was to evaluate the  prevalence of asb in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2d) with and without microalbuminuria (ma). findings: a hundred diabetic subjects with ma (53  males/47 females, mean age +/- standard deviation: 65.5 +/- 11.1 years) and 100 diabetic subjects without ma (52 males/48 females, mean age +/- standard deviation: 65.4 +/- 11.3 years), consecutively attending the outpatient diabetes  clinic of our hospital were recruited in the study. subjects with overt diabetic  nephropathy or nephropathy from other causes were excluded. in addition, subjects with symptoms of urinary track infection or use of antimicrobial drugs in the last 14 days were excluded by the study.diabetic subjects with ma showed increased prevalence of asb compared to diabetic subjects without ma (21% versus  8%, p < 0.001, respectively). escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen isolated in diabetic subjects with and without ma (12% versus 3.0%, p = 0.01, respectively) followed by proteus mirabilis (6% versus 5%, p = 0.75, respectively) and klebsiella spp (5% versus 1%, p = 0.09, respectively). univariate logistic analysis showed that asb was associated with the presence of  coronary artery disease [odds ratio (or): 0.29, 95% confidence intervals (95% ci): 0.09-0.95, p = 0.04] and gender (or: 0.09, 95% ci: 0.02-0.35, p < 0.001) in  the diabetic study group with ma. conclusions: asb is more prevalent among t2d subjects with ma. screening for asb is warranted in diabetic patients especially  if pyuria is detected in urine analysis since asb has been found to be a risk factor for developing symptomatic urinary tract infection.

TI  == determinants of beta-lactam resistance in meningitis-causing enterobacteriaceae in brazil.
AB  == this study analyzed resistance determinants in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteria and the epidemiology of 11 escherichia coli isolates obtained from meningitis patients in a region of brazil from 2000 to 2005. esbl-encoding genes and their genetic environment were investigated by pcr  and sequencing. the gene blactx-m-2 was identified in 3 different enterobacteria  (e. coli, serratia marcescens, and proteus mirabilis) downstream of the insertion sequence iscr1 (localized in class 1 integrons), but not as part of the resistance cassettes region. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) was used to investigate genetic relationships between the 11 e. coli isolates in this study and strains associated with meningitis in the e. coli mlst database. mlst analysis indicated high genetic diversity among isolates, and no significant genetic relationship was identified with meningitis-causing e. coli in the database. the results in this report reinforce the need to be attentive to meningitis suspected to be due to esbl-producing enterobacterial isolates, especially where esbl epidemiology is well known.

TI  == [detection of bla(ctx-m) beta-lactamase genes in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == widespread production of ctx-m type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in enterobacteriaceae strains which are resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is the most remarkable example for rapid and global spread of plasmid mediated antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. consecutive 200 esbl producing enterobacteriaceae strains out of 1640 isolates that were obtained from clinical samples (167 urine, 11 wound, 7 bronchoalveolar lavage, 3 peritoneal fluid, 2 cerebrospinal fluid, 2 biopsy, 2 tracheal aspirate, 2 conjunctiva, 1 abscess, 1 catheter) between february to july 2009 in our laboratory were included to this study. among the 200 esbl positive isolates 141 (70.5%) were escherichia coli, 51 (26%) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 5 (2.5%) were enterobacter spp. and one of each (0.5%) citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca and proteus  mirabilis. esbl positivity was 11% among the 123 community-acquired strains and 13% among the 77 hospital acquired strains, the statistical difference being insignificant (p > 0.05). the prevalence of bla(ctx-m) beta-lactamase genes were  detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction with the use of two general primer sets: ctx-ma1 and ctx-ma2 primers for the amplification of ctx-m-1, ctx-m-2 and ctx-m-9 enzymes group, and ctx825-f and ctx825-r primers for the amplification of ctx-m-8 and ctx-m-25 enzymes group. bla(ctx-m) genes were detected in 167 out of 200 strains (83.5%). ctx-m production rates in community and hospital acquired strains were found as 86.2% and 79.2%, respectively and no  statistically significant difference was detected (p > 0.05). ctx-m producing strains were either e. coli (n = 132) or klebsiella spp. (n = 35) and were expressing one of the enzymes from ctx-m-1, ctx-m-2 or ctx-m-9 groups. no strains carrying ctx-m-8 or ctx-m-25 group enzymes were detected. ctx-m production rates  in esbl producing e. coli strains in community and hospital were found as 92.5% and 95.7%, respectively, whereas the same rates for esbl producing klebsiella spp. strains were 67.8% and 66.7%. the difference between the ctx-m production rates of community and hospital acquired strains was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). in conclusion, ctx-m prevalence was found high in esbl producing strains of both e. coli and klebsiella spp. since bla(ctx-m) gene acquisition usually results in the emergence of multiple drug-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains, screening for ctx-m type esbl production in the laboratory has an important impact on monitoring the resistant strains which have endemic potential.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefditoren and other antimicrobials against enterobacteriaceae causing community-acquired uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: a spanish nationwide multicenter study.
AB  == cefditoren is a third-generation orally administered cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species. after an oral 400-mg single dose, the mean concentrations in urine are 186.5 mg/l at 2 to 4 h and 12.7 mg/l at 8 to 12 h, and it is a potential drug to be used in  the treatment of urinary tract infection (uti). we performed a multicenter nationwide study in spain in order to determine the in vitro activity of cefditoren and other comparative agents against enterobacteriaceae causing community-acquired uncomplicated uti in women. from june 2008 to march 2009, 89 institutions participated in the study. a total of 2152 enterobacteriaceae were collected and sent to a coordinating laboratory where identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed against 20 antimicrobials using an automated microdilution method (microscan; siemens, sacramento, ca). cefditoren mics were determined by the broth microdilution method (clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines) using the same inoculum. microorganisms isolated were escherichia coli (81.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.9%), proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and others (5.1%). a total of 51 isolates (2.4%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers, 3 (0.1%) produced  plasmidic ampc enzymes, and 64 (2.9%) produced chromosomal ampc. the mic(50)/mic(90) (mg/l) of cefditoren against all isolates was 0.12/0.5. cefditoren inhibited 96.5% of isolates at 1 mg/l and was uniformly active against all isolates with the exception of strains producing esbls or ampc enzymes. the mic(50)/mic(90) of other antimicrobials were ampicillin (amp) >16/>16, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (a/c) <or=8/4/16/8, cefuroxime (fur) <or=4/8, cefotaxime <or=1/<or=1, ciprofloxacin (cip) <or=0.12/>2, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (sxt) <or=2/38/>4/76, and fosfomycin (fos) <or=16/<or=16. the respective percentages of resistance were 61%, 17.2%, 5.5%, 2.3%, 20.2%, 27.4%, and 4.8%. the activity of cefditoren against enterobacteriaceae producing community-acquired uncomplicated uti in women was superior to that of amp, a/c, fur, cip, and sxt and similar to that of fos.

TI  == the use of lytic bacteriophages in the prevention and eradication of biofilms of  proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli.
AB  == antibiotics have been the cornerstone of the clinical management of bacterial infections since their discovery in the early part of the last century. eight decades later, their widespread, often indiscriminate use, has resulted in an overall reduction in their effectiveness, with reports of multidrug-resistant bacteria now commonplace. increasing reliance on indwelling medical devices, which are inherently susceptible to biofilm-mediated infections, has contributed  to unacceptably high rates of nosocomial infections, placing a strain on healthcare budgets. this study investigates the use of lytic bacteriophages in the treatment and prevention of biofilms of bacterial species commonly associated with infections of indwelling urological devices and catheter-associated urinary  tract infections. the use of lytic bacteriophages against established biofilms of proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli is described, whereby biofilm populations  have been reduced successfully by three to four log cycles (99.9-99.99% removal). the prevention of biofilm formation on foley catheter biomaterials following impregnation of hydrogel-coated catheter sections with a lytic bacteriophage has  also been investigated. this has revealed an approximate 90% reduction in both p. mirabilis and e. coli biofilm formation on bacteriophage-treated catheters when compared with untreated controls.

AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producers in the family enterobacteriaceae are recognized worldwide as nosocomial pathogens, however it is difficult to screen them in the routine laboratory processing. chromid esbl agar newly developed for screening esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae was released in japan in april, 2007. we evaluated the clinical assessment of chromid esbl agar in routine microbiology laboratory. the 47 strains investigated were clinical isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae with the mics of cefpodoxime greater than 2 mug/ml. the 27 esbl-producers examined were comprising of 19 escherichia coli, 3 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 citrobacter freundii, 3 enterobacter cloacae, and 1 s. marcescens (esbl group) and 20 esbl non-producers  consiating of 5 k. oxytoca, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 p. vlugaris, 2 serratia marcescens, 8 c. freundii, 2 enterobacter cloacae, and 1 e. aerogenes (non-esbl group). characterization of beta-lactamase genes was carried out by use of polymerase chain reaction. as the results, the sensitivity and the specificity of chromid esbl agar plates after incubation for 18 hours was 100% and 20%, respectively. it should be noted that the values of specificity was extremely low compared with those of the sensitivity. these findings clearly suggested that in  cases of utilizing chromid esbl agar plates, it should be important to consider its characteristic properties, as even the esbl-non-producers could grow on these media only when they were resistant to cpdx.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria causing otitis externa in dogs.
AB  == bacterial agents are considered important pathogens causing external otitis in dogs. it is essential to carry out bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test in the case of otitis externa, particularly for chronic or recurring cases. sterile swab samples were obtained from terminal part of vertical ear canals of 74 dogs with otitis externa for cytology, bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test. cytologic smears were stained using gram and giemsa staining methods. aerobic bacterial culture performed on blood agar and macconkey agar. among total number of 92 isolated bacteria, 68 were staphylococcus intermedius. other isolated bacteria included: pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, pasteurella canis, and six other species of coagulase-negative staphylococcus. antimicrobial susceptibility test were performed for all isolated bacteria using 14 antibiotics. based on the results of this study, all isolated staphylococcus spp. were sensitive to amikacin, enrofloxacin, and rifampin, and had low resistance to gentamicin, cephalothin and ceftriaxone. more than half of gram-positive isolates were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. generally, all isolated gram-negative bacteria, were sensitive to amikacin and enrofloxacin, and had low resistance to  ceftriaxone and gentamicin. they were highly resistant to penicillin, eythromycin, and cephalothin. regarding the results of this study, in cases of uncomplicated otitis externa, it is possible to select antimicrobial drugs merely based on cytology, but it is recommended to perform bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test. however, in complicated or refractory cases, antimicrobials should be selected based on bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test.

TI  == effect of uropathogens on in vitro encrustation of polyurethane double j ureteral stents.
AB  == polyurethane stents are used when there is an obstruction to the flow of urine. a majority of the patients with such stents are at the risk of urinary tract infection and salt encrustation. the present study is aimed at analyzing the in vitro encrustation of calcium oxalate and other salts in the presence of common uropathogens (e. coli and p. mirabilis) on films made from tecoflex((r)), a commercial grade polyurethane. in the absence of uropathogens, sodium ions and ammonia favor calcium adsorption whereas magnesium ions greatly depress it, resulting in increased hydrophillicity of the stent. with e. coli, mg ions enhance the encrustation of calcium, whereas the other salts decrease its deposition. in case of p. mirabilis, irrespective of the type of salt, it enhances calcium encrustation except in the presence of sodium ions. adhesion of  uropathogens to the stent surface was higher in the presence of bovine serum albumin. understanding the dynamics between various salts and microorganism in the urine, and urine-stent interface would aid in designing stents that are inert, resist encrustation and biofilm formation.

AB  == background: this study aimed to identify the agents causing community-acquired urinary tract infections (cautis) and their resistance patterns and to investigate risk factors for esbl production. material/methods: patients diagnosed at the department of infectious diseases in the cukurova university school of medicine hospital with cauti between january 2006 and april 2007 were included prospectively. patient data were recorded and the microorganisms and their sensitivity patterns were evaluated by the university's central microbiology laboratory. results: a total 146 patients with cautis, 109 women and 37 men (mean age: 50.9+/-18.44 years), were included in the study. the most common infectious agents were escherichia coli (76.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), proteus mirabilis (4.1%), and enterococcus spp. (1.6%). the ciprofloxacin resistance rate for e. coli was 35% and resistance to tmp-smz 43%, whereas amikacin resistance was substantially low (3%). four of 12 k. pneumoniae strains  were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 2 to tmp-smz. resistance to amikacin was not  found in the k. pneumoniae strains. esbl production was identified in 25 of the 112 e. coli and k. pneumoniae strains. a history of a uti within the last 6 months (p=0.029) and a history of frequent uti (p=0.028) were found to be significant risk factors for esbl production by univariate analysis. the only independent risk factor was a history of urinary system infection in the past 6 months (p=0.025) according to multivariate regression analysis. conclusions: these high resistance rates to antimicrobials and particularly the extremely high rate of esbl production in cauti should be carefully considered.

TI  == assessing the emergence of resistance: the absence of biological cost in vivo may compromise fosfomycin treatments for p. aeruginosa infections.
AB  == background: fosfomycin is a cell wall inhibitor used efficiently to treat uncomplicated urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections. a very convenient feature of fosfomycin, among others, is that although the expected frequency of resistant mutants is high, the biological cost associated with mutation impedes an effective growth rate, and bacteria cannot offset the obstacles posed by host  defenses or compete with sensitive bacteria. due to the current scarcity of new antibiotics, fosfomycin has been proposed as an alternative treatment for other infections caused by a wide variety of bacteria, particularly pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, whether fosfomycin resistance in p. aeruginosa provides a fitness cost still remains unknown. principal findings: we herein present experimental evidence to show that fosfomycin resistance cannot only emerge easily during treatment, but that it is also cost-free for p. aeruginosa. we also tested if, as has been reported for other species such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, fosfomycin resistant strains are somewhat compromised in their virulence. as concerns colonization, persistence, lung damage, and lethality, we found no differences between the fosfomycin resistant mutant and its sensitive parental strain. the probability of acquisition in vitro of resistance to the combination of fosfomycin with other antibiotics (tobramycin and imipenem) has also been studied. while the combination of fosfomycin with tobramycin makes improbable the emergence of resistance to both antibiotics when administered together, the combination of fosfomycin plus imipenem does not avoid the appearance of mutants resistant to both antibiotics. conclusions: we have reached the conclusion that the use of fosfomycin for p. aeruginosa infections, even in combined therapy, might not be as promising as expected. this study should encourage the scientific community to assess the in vivo cost of resistance for specific antibiotic-bacterial species combinations, and therefore avoid reaching universal conclusions from single model organisms.

TI  == [characteristics of urinary tract infections in different patient subpopulations  and depending on the bladder emptying system].
AB  == introduction: to analyze the prevalence and etiology of urinary tract infection in patients with neurogenic bladder depending on the bladder emptying system used as compared to a population with no neurological impairment. to assess perception of urinary tract infection by patients with neurogenic bladder. materials and methods: an epidemiological and prospective study was conducted on 283 patients,  in whom a total of 283 urethral cultures were performed. of these, 106 came from  patients with neurological damage, 28 from a control group with no neurological impairment, 74 from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (icu) of our hospital, and 75 from patients who attended the emergency room for symptoms of acute urinary tract infection. the sensitivity and specificity of patient perception as indicative of urinary tract infection was analyzed using roc curves. results: positive urethral cultures were found in 66% of patients with neurological damage and 25% of control patients. within the neurological group, patients with the highest rates of positive urethral cultures were those with myelomeningocele (mmc) (81.5%) and spinal cord injuries (71.7%), with a statistically significant difference (p=0.01). the microorganism most commonly found in all subgroups was escherichia coli, followed by enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the neurological subgroup, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis in the control subgroup, and klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus agalactiae in the emergency room subgroup. in the icu subgroup, the most commonly found microorganism was enterococcus faecalis, followed by escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. sensitivity for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was 97.2%, as compared to 80% in the control group. specificity was low in both groups. conclusions: e. coli was the microorganism found in positive urethral cultures from all subgroups, except in the icu group. the groups with the highest urinary tract infection rates were patients with mmc and spinal cord injuries. sensitivity and specificity (as measured using roc curves) for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was higher in neurological patients than in the non-neurological control group (p=0.0004, area: 0.643).

TI  == recovery and screening for antibiotic susceptibility of potential bacterial pathogens from the oral cavity of shark species involved in attacks on humans in  recife, brazil.
AB  == the number of incidents involving sharks and humans at beaches in recife, on the  north-eastern brazilian coast, is among the highest worldwide. in addition, wound infections in survivors are common; but the nature and risk of the aetiological agents is unknown. in the present study, 81 potential bacterial pathogens were identified in the oral cavity of sharks involved in attacks in recife, and were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility tests using the standardized disc-diffusion method. the majority were enterobacteria such as enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., proteus spp., providencia alcalifaciens, escherichia coli, moellerella wisconcensis and leclercia adecarboxylata. other gram-negative  bacteria included vibrio spp., burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas spp. in addition, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp., enterococcus spp. and micrococcus spp. were identified, besides streptococcus spp. from the viridans group. resistance was especially found in the proteus mirabilis and citrobacter freundii, and ranged from 4 to 6 antibiotics out of the 13 tested. gentamicin and vancomycin were the most effective against gram-positive cocci strains, whereas levofloxacin was fully inhibitory against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. these data are discussed in light of a retrospective evaluation of the medical records of three  shark victims treated at restauracao hospital in recife.

TI  == potential airborne microbial hazards for workers on dairy and beef cattle farms in egypt.
AB  == this study was conducted to determine the concentration and frequency distribution of certain airborne micro-organisms on cattle farms and their potential health hazards to farm workers. the samples (60 air samples and 240 hand and nasal swabs from cattle farm workers) were collected from ten cattle farms (five dairy barns and five beef sheds) located in the sharkia governorate of egypt. air samples were collected for microbiological examination in liquid media using an all-glass impinger whereas those for fungal examination were placed on agar plates using slit air samplers (aeroscopes). the results showed that the overall means of total culturable bacterial and fungal counts were lower in the air of dairy cattle barns than in beef cattle sheds. identification of the isolated bacteria revealed the recovery of the following species (from dairy cattle barns versus beef cattle sheds): staphylococcus epidermidis (26.7% vs 36.7%), s. saprophyticus (20% vs 33.3%), s. aureus (10% vs 16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (23.3% vs 26.7%), enterobacter agglomerans (23.3 vs 13.3%), escherichia  coli, (16.7% vs 26.7%), klebsiella oxytoca, (10% vs 16.7%), k. pneumoniae (3.3% vs 0%), proteus rettegri (6.7% vs 13.3%), p. mirabilis (10% vs 10%), p. vulgaris  (3.3% vs 6.7%), pseudomonas species (6.7% vs 16.7%), respectively). mycological examination of air samples revealed the presence of aspergillus fumigatus (46.7%  vs 63.3%), a. niger (20% vs 36.7%), a. flavus (13.3% vs 26.7%), penicillium citrinum (16.7% vs 23.3%), p. viridicatum (13.3% vs 6.7%), p. capsulatum (3.3% vs 0%), cladosporium spp. (30% vs 56.7%), alternaria spp. (13.3 vs 23.3%), mucor spp. (6.7% vs 16.7%), fusarium spp. (3.3% vs 10%), absidia spp. (6.7% vs 10%), curvilaria spp. (10% vs 3.3%), rhizopus spp. (6.7% vs 13.3%), scopulariopsis (3.3% vs 6.7%), epicoccum spp. (0% vs 3.4%) and yeast (13.3% vs 20%), respectively. in addition, microbiological examinations of farm workers revealed  heavy contamination of their hands and noses with most of the micro-organisms detected in the air of cattle farms. the results showed that potential airborne microbial risks in beef cattle sheds were greater than in dairies.

TI  == loss of the waal o-antigen ligase prevents surface activation of the flagellar gene cascade in proteus mirabilis.
AB  == proteus mirabilis is a gram-negative bacterium that undergoes a physical and biochemical change from a vegetative swimmer cell (a typical gram-negative rod) to an elongated swarmer cell when grown on a solid surface. in this study, we report that a transposon insertion in the waal gene, encoding o-antigen ligase, blocked swarming motility on solid surfaces but had little effect on swimming motility in soft agar. the waal mutant was unable to differentiate into a swarmer cell. differentiation was also prevented by a mutation in wzz, encoding a chain length determinant for o antigen, but not by a mutation in wzye, encoding an enzyme that polymerizes enterobacterial common antigen, a surface polysaccharide  different from the lipid a::core. in wild-type p. mirabilis, increased expression of the flhdc operon occurs after growth on solid surfaces and is required for the high-level expression of flagellin that is characteristic of swarmer cells. however, in both the waal and the wzz mutants, the flhdc operon was not activated during growth on agar. a loss-of-function mutation in the rcsb response regulator or overexpression of flhdc restored swarming to the waal mutant, despite the absence of o antigen. therefore, although o antigen may serve a role in swarming  by promoting wettability, the loss of o antigen blocks a regulatory pathway that  links surface contact with the upregulation of flhdc expression.

TI  == distinct bacterial colonization patterns of escherichia coli subtypes associate with rheumatoid factor status in early inflammatory arthritis.
AB  == objectives: the aetiology of ra is unknown; however, bacterial exposure, particularly to escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae, has been linked to disease pathogenesis. the strongest association was observed for rf(+) ra. we compare colonization patterns of these bacteria, and the anti-bacterial antibody levels in early onset rf(+) and rf(-) inflammatory arthritis. methods: bacteria isolated from stool and urine of early-stage rf(+) and rf(-) patients recruited to the early arthritis registry were biochemically identified and genotyped. igm and iga anti-bacterial and rf antibodies were assessed by elisa. results: differences in the types of colonizing pathogenic e.  coli were identified. rf(+) patients were more commonly colonized with phylogenetic group d e. coli, whereas rf(-) patients were more commonly colonized with phylogenetic group b2 e. coli and these individuals also had lower joint scores and inflammatory markers yet higher iga anti-e. coli antibody responses. conclusions: these studies link the type of colonizing bacteria in the gut and urine with the immune response (anti-bacterial and rf) in early-onset inflammatory arthritis and provide evidence for a role of the host-pathogen response in the aetiology of rf.

TI  == metallo-beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  == the emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (ltcf) residents around bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. all routine enterobacteriaceae isolates from a bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated  long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for mbls, with case details reviewed for the source patients. in total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 escherichia coli, six klebsiella pneumoniae, four klebsiella oxytoca, four citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae and two morganella morganii, as well as single citrobacter amalonaticus, enterobacter aerogenes, providencia stuartii and proteus mirabilis isolates. all were pcr-positive for bla(vim) and 25 were pcr-positive for qnrs; 19 non-k. pneumoniae had bla(shv) and one had bla(ctx-m-group1); 13 were from 12 ltcf residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. all these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or ltcf stay; only seven had infections due to the mbl producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. five patients had more than one mbl-producing organism.  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related e. coli, whereas pairs of k. pneumoniae and c. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be pcr-positive for bla(vim), qnrs and bla(shv); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(vim-1), qnrs1 and bla(shv-12) were detected by sequencing.

TI  == an assessment of the antibacterial activity in larval excretion/secretion of four species of insects recorded in association with corpses, using lucilia sericata meigen as the marker species.
AB  == the relative antibacterial activities of excretion/secretion (es) from two carrion-feeding insects, calliphora vicina robineau-desvoidy and dermestes maculatus degeer, and a detritivore, tenebrio molitor linnaeus, were compared to  that of lucilia sericata meigen, a species with es of known antibacterial capacity, in order to explore the antimicrobial potential of other carrion and detritivore species. viable counts were used to assess time-kill of es against five bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. antibacterial activity was recorded in all four insect species although t. molitor and d. maculatus were the most effective in controlling growth of p. mirabilis. the blowflies were more effective in controlling a wider range of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the larval es from all species was shown to reduce bacterial growth rate although differences in antibacterial spectrum were noted and the degree of  potency varied between the four species. these differences may be explained ecologically by the different colonisation times of each insect species on the corpse. overall, this study demonstrates that research into other carrion-feeding insect species has potential to provide an increased source of antimicrobial chemicals to broaden the range of bacterial species beyond that currently controlled using l. sericata.

TI  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection in gram-negative bacilli of nosocomial origin.
AB  == background: resistance to third generation cephalosporins by acquisition and expression of extended spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) enzymes among gram-negative bacilli is on a rise. the presence of esbl producing organisms significantly affects the course and outcome of an infection and poses a challenge to infection management worldwide. materials and methods: in the period from june 2007 to 2008, we collected 1489 samples from patients suspected of nosocomial infection.  the isolates were identified based on colony morphology and biochemical reaction. gram negative bacilli resistant to third generation cephalosporins were tested for esbl by double disc synergy test (ddst- a screening test)and then phenotypic  confirmatory test. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by modified kirby bauer disc diffusion method. results: from the sample of 238 gram-negative  bacilli, we isolated escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii and enterobacter cloacae. following both methods, 34% isolates were esbl-positive. the esbl producing isolates were significantly resistant (p < 0.01) to ampicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin as compared to non-esbl producers. multidrug resistance was significantly (p < 0.01) higher (69.14%) in esbl positive isolates than non-esbl isolates (21.66%). conclusion: high prevalence of esbl in our hospital cannot be ignored. esbl producers can be detected by ddst and phenotypic confirmatory test with equal efficacy. the sensitivity of screening test improved with the use of more than one antibiotic and addition of  one or two antibiotics would not increase cost and labor. we recommend ddst using multiple antibiotics in all microbiology units as a routine screening test.

TI  == photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric utis.
AB  == aims: to test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (uti) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. methods and results: toluidine blue (tb), methylene blue (mb), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ala), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical uti-implicated pathogens staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis. standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm led-illuminated conditions. tb and mb were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being  assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with  the other compounds. trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ala required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. conclusions: tb and mb were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. significance and impact of the study: ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. the photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide interaction is decisive for the activity of the antimicrobial  peptide nk-2 against escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == phosphatidylglycerol is a widely used mimetic to study the effects of amps (antimicrobial peptides) on the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. however, the antibacterial activities of novel nk-2-derived amps could not be sufficiently explained by using this simple model system. since the lps (lipopolysaccharide)-containing outer membrane is the first barrier of gram-negative bacteria, in the present study we investigated interactions of nk-2 and a shortened variant with viable escherichia coli wbb01 and proteus mirabilis  r45, and with model membranes composed of lps isolated from these two strains. differences in net charge and charge distribution of the two lps have been proposed to be responsible for the differential sensitivity of the respective bacteria to other amps. as imaged by tem (transmission electron microscopy) and afm (atomic force microscopy), nk-2-mediated killing of these bacteria was corroborated by structural alterations of the outer and inner membranes, the release of e. coli cytoplasma, and the formation of unique fibrous structures inside p. mirabilis, suggesting distinct and novel intracellular targets. nk-2 bound to and intercalated into lps bilayers, and eventually induced the formation of transient heterogeneous lesions in planar lipid bilayers. however, the discriminative activity of nk-2 against the two bacterial strains was independent of membrane intercalation and lesion formation, which both were indistinguishable for the two lps. instead, differences in activity originated from the lps-binding step, which could be demonstrated by nk-2 attachment to intact bacteria, and to solid-supported lps bilayers on a surface acoustic wave biosensor.

TI  == notes on the microbiology of cholesteatoma: clinical findings and treatment.
AB  == anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. this could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. this study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and  65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. the floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.7%), escherichia coli (1.4%)  and klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly  high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (peptococcus 12.4% and peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), bacteroides (12.4%), clostridium (3.8%), fusobacterium (2.9%) and propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. in 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only aspergillus, in association with pseudomonas and staphylococcus, was identified. the study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins  are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on pseudomonas and staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.

AB  == the identification of patients carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria is important, since these patients are at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical therapy if they become infected. the purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of esbl-producing bacteria in patients with travellers' diarrhoea. patients with travellers' diarrhoea (n = 242) having delivered stool samples for the diagnosis of salmonella, shigella, yersinia or campylobacter, were also examined for esbl-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. the overall prevalence of faecal carriage of esbl-producing bacteria was 24% (58/242). of the patients who  had travelled in europe, 3% (2/63) were found to be esbl carriers in comparison to 36% (50/138) of those who had travelled outside europe. esbl-producing e. coli was especially common among patients returning from india (11/14), egypt (19/38;  50%) and thailand (8/38; 22%). in total, 90% of the genes of the esbl-positive samples were of ctx-m type. the ctx-m-1 group dominated, followed by the ctx-m-9  group. the repetitive sequence-based pcr fingerprint pattern showed that there was no similarity between the esbl strains found. patients who have travelled outside europe are at high risk of being colonized with esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, and, if infected, are also at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == severe renal failure in acute bacterial pyelonephritis: do not forget corticosteroids.
AB  == acute renal failure (arf) is a rare complication of acute pyelonephritis in adult immunocompetent patients. recovery of renal function usually occurs if antibiotics are promptly initiated. however, long-term consequences of renal scarring due to acute pyelonephritis are probably underestimated, and some patients present with prolonged renal failure despite adequate antibiotic therapy. we report two cases of severe arf complicating bacterial pyelonephritis  successfully treated with corticosteroids in association with conventional antibiotics.

TI  == [antimicrobial treatment of nosocomial intra-abdominal infections--new treatment  options with tygecycline].
AB  == introduction: nosocomial, intra-abdominal infections are extremely serious conditions, considering possibilities for their early diagnosis, as well as for their effective therapy. multiresistant bacteria (enterobacteriacae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases - esbl escherichia coli, klebsiella species, vancomycin-resistant enterococci [vre], and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus [mrsa]) are frequently isolated as pathogens of these infections. tygecycline is among the novel wide- spectrum antibiotics affecting multiresistant bacteria, which are being introduced in clinical practice. aim: the aim of this study is to assess actual sensitivity of tygecycline to the commonest pathogens of intra-abdominal infections, generated in hospitalized surgical patients. based on the sensitivity tests, tygecycline was indicated for  targeted antibiotic therapy in intraabdominal infections. methods: sensitivity to tygecycline, aminopenicillins, fluorochinoloni and gentamycine was established for the following bacteria: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonie, enterobacter  cloacea, proteus mirabilis. sensitivity to oxacillin, clincamycine and tygecycline was tested in staphylococcus aureus, and to fluorochinolini, gentamycine and tygecycline in enterococcus faecalis, and to fluorochinoloni, gentamycine, ceftazidime and gentamycine in pseudomonas aeruginosa. based on the  sensitivity results, tygecycline was administered in two patients with postsurgical intra-abdominal infections caused by esbl escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonie. the initital dose of tygecycline was 100 mg i.v., followed  by tygecycline 50 mg i.v. every 12 hours for 7 days. results: the isolated bacteria showed 98-100% sensitivity to tygecycline, except psudomonas aeruginosa, where 100% resistance was demonstrated. targeted antimicrobial medication with tygecycline proved effective in postoperative nosocomial intra-abdominal infections, the both concerned patients recovered. conclusion: the choice of antimicrobial medication in nosocomial intra-abdominal infections requires through evaluation considering various factors including prior antibiotic therapy, co-morbidities and the current status of sensitivity with respect to potential multiresistant pathogens. tygecycline shows significant in vitro efficacy against resistant gram-positive and key gram-negative facultative bacteria, which are a common cause of intra-abdominal infections in surgery patients. clinical experience has shown that tygecycline is safe and effective in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates from the chinese meropenem surveillance study (cmss), 2003-2008.
AB  == the chinese meropenem surveillance study (cmss) programme was initiated in 2003 with the aim of monitoring the antimicrobial activity of broad-spectrum agents against nosocomial gram-negative bacilli in china. from 2003 to 2008, a total of  3892 isolates were collected from 10 teaching hospitals. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 11 antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. during the study period, a marked decrease in the susceptibility of acinetobacter spp. to meropenem and imipenem was noticed, from 94.6% to 60.7%  and from 92.5% to 62.1%, respectively. however, for pseudomonas aeruginosa the susceptibility was relatively stable, with susceptibility rates of 86.2% to 76.0% for meropenem and 74.8% to 70.5% for imipenem. meropenem and imipenem exhibited the highest activities against enterobacterial organisms, with ranges of mic(90)  values (mic for 90% of the organisms) from 0.064mg/l to 0.25mg/l and 0.25 to 4mg/l, respectively. except for acinetobacter spp., the next most active agent against the majority of isolates was amikacin, with susceptibility ranging from 78.8% to 93.3%, followed by piperacillin/tazobactam (73.7% to 98.2%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (63.9% to 99.1%), cefepime (67.0% to 95.4%) and ceftazidime (54.5% to 93.3%). the percentage of isolates positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and proteus mirabilis ranged from 50.9% to 66.7%, 25.4% to 42.4% and 8.9% to 24.2%, respectively. these cmss results have demonstrated increasing resistance of acinetobacter spp. to carbapenems, resulting from the spread of highly resistant  clones. continued surveillance studies, including cmss, as well as potent measures for controlling the spread of resistant clones are required.

TI  == microbial aetiologic agents associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  == pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patients. the aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to hiv and mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. the patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. the tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of hiv/aids and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only hiv infection were 10 (5.9%). the  distribution of isolates were as follows, staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), candida albicans 24 (14.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. this study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to hiv/aids and tb or co-infection with tb/hiv-aids. this may lead to drug resistance, dots or haart programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine and tris-edta.
AB  == minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine 0.15% and tris-edta (otodine) were determined by broth microdilution for 150 isolates representing the most common pathogens associated  with canine otitis. the microorganisms were classified into three groups according to their levels of susceptibility. the most susceptible group included  staphylococcus pseudintermedius, malassezia pachydermatis, streptococcus canis and corynebacterium auriscanis, which were generally killed by 1 : 64 dilution of the antiseptic product (mbc = 23/0.8 microg/ml of chlorhexidine/tris-edta). the most resistant organism was proteus mirabilis, which survived up to 1 : 8 dilution of the product (mbc = 375/12 microg/ml). escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus displayed intermediate mbcs ranging between  188/6 and 47/1.5 microg/ml. interestingly, s. pseudintermedius was more susceptible than s. aureus, and no significant difference was observed between meticillin-resistant and meticillin-susceptible isolates within each species, indicating that antiseptic use is unlikely to co-select for meticillin resistance. although the concentrations required for killing (mbcs) varied considerably with microorganism type, the combination of chlorhexidine 0.15% and  tris-edta was active against all the pathogens most commonly involved in canine otitis.

TI  == international spread and persistence of tem-24 is caused by the confluence of highly penetrating enterobacteriaceae clones and an inca/c2 plasmid containing tn1696::tn1 and is5075-tn21.
AB  == tem-24 remains one of the most widespread tem-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among enterobacteriaceae. to analyze the reasons influencing its spread and persistence, a multilevel population genetics study was carried out on 28 representative tem-24 producers from belgium, france, portugal, and spain (13 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 6 escherichia coli isolates, 6 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 2 proteus mirabilis isolates, and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate, from 1998 to 2004). clonal relatedness (xbai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [pfge] and e. coli phylogroups) and antibiotic susceptibility were determined by standard procedures. plasmid analysis included  determination of the incompatibility group (by pcr, hybridization, and/or sequencing) and comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) patterns. characterization of genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance included integrons (classes 1, 2, and 3) and transposons (tn3, tn21, and tn402).  similar pfge patterns were identified among e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis isolates, while e. coli strains were diverse (phylogenetic groups a, b2, and d). highly related 180-kb inca/c2 plasmids conferring resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides were identified. each plasmid contained defective in0-tn402 (dfra1-aada1, aaca4, or aaca4-aacc1-orfe-aada2-cmla1) and in4-tn402 (aaca4 or dfra1-aada1) variants. these integrons were located within tn21, tn1696, or hybrids of these transposons, with is5075 interrupting their irtnp and irmer. in all cases, blatem-24 was part of an is5075-deltatn1 transposon within tnp1696, mimicking other genetic elements containing blatem-2 and blatem-3 variants. the international dissemination of tem-24 is fuelled by an inca/c2 plasmid acquired by different enterobacterial clones which seem to evolve by gaining diverse genetic elements. this work highlights the risks of a confluence between highly penetrating clones and highly promiscuous plasmids in the spread of antibiotic resistance, and it contributes to the elucidation of the origin and evolution of  tem-2 esbl derivatives.

TI  == electrostatic binding of substituted metal phthalocyanines to enterobacterial cells: its role in photodynamic inactivation.
AB  == the effect of ionic substituents in zinc and aluminum phthalocyanine molecules and of membrane surface charge on the interaction of dyes with artificial membranes and enterobacterial cells, as well as on photosensitization efficiency  was studied. it has been shown that increasing the number of positively charged substituents enhances the extent of phthalocyanine binding to escherichia coli cells. this, along with the high quantum yield of singlet oxygen generation, determines efficient photodynamic inactivation of gram-negative bacteria by zinc  and aluminum octacationic phthalocyanines. the effect of ca2+ and mg2+ cations and ph on photodynamic inactivation of enterobacteria in the presence of octacationic zinc phthalocyanine has been studied. it has been shown that effects resulting in lowering negative charge on outer membrane protect bacteria against  photoinactivation, which confirms the crucial role in this process of the electrostatic interaction of the photosensitizer with the cell wall. electrostatic nature of binding is consistent with mainly electrostatic character of dye interactions with artificial membranes of different composition. lower sensitivity of proteus mirabilis to photodynamic inactivation, compared to that of e. coli and salmonella enteritidis, due to low affinity of the cationic dye to the cells of this species, was found.

AB  == although bacteriophage t5 is known to have lytic proteins for cell wall hydrolysis and phage progeny escape, their activities are still unknown. this is  the first report on the cloning, expression and biochemical characterization of a bacteriophage t5 lytic hydrolase. the endolysin-encoding lys gene of virulent coliphage t5 was cloned in escherichia coli cells, and an electrophoretically homogeneous product of this gene was obtained with a high yield (78% of total activity). the protein purified was shown to be an l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidase. the enzyme demonstrated maximal activity in diluted buffers (25-50 mm) at ph 8.5. the enzyme was strongly inhibited by edta and bapta, and fully reactivated by calcium/manganese chlorides. it was found that, along with e. coli peptidoglycan, peptidase of bacteriophage t5 can lyse peptidoglycans of other gram-negative microorganisms (pectobacterium carotovorum, pseudomonas putida, proteus vulgaris, and proteus mirabilis). this endolysin is the first example of  an l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidase in a virulent phage infecting gram-negative bacteria. there are, however, a great many sequences in databases that are highly similar to that of bacteriophage t5 hydrolase, indicating a wide distribution of  endolytic l-alanoyl-d-glutamate peptidases. the article discusses how an enzyme with such substrate specificity could be fixed in the process of evolution.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) fruits from different regions.
AB  == structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) obtained from different regions (germany, india, and turkey). the main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined  by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. it was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. the highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from germany and india was higher than that of kefe cumin  fruits obtained from turkey. the fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris (fmc  1), proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus (fmc 19), aeromonas hydrophila (atcc 7965), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 15753), klebsiella pneumoniae (fmc 5), salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes (ccm 2531) and escherichia coli (atcc 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.

TI  == justification for the use of ocimum gratissimum l in herbal medicine and its interaction with disc antibiotics.
AB  == background: the ethanolic extract of the leaves of ocimium gratisimum l. (lamiaceae), used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several ailments such as urinary tract, wound, skin and gastrointestinal infections, was evaluated for its antibacterial properties against four clinical bacteria isolates namely:  escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa and the antifungal properties using a clinical isolate of candida albicans. a typed bacterium of escherichia coli atcc 11775 and another typed fungal strain of candida albicans (atcc 90028) were also included. the study also intended to verify if the concomitant administration of conventional antibiotics  with ocimium gratisimum which is normally taken as food (spice) will negatively affect its activity. methods: the agar diffusion method was used to test the in vitro activity of the plant extract. the interaction of the plant extract with some disc antibiotics namely: ciprofloxacin, septrin, streptomycin, ampicillin, nystatin and ketoconazole was tested using the agar overlay inoculum susceptibility disc method. phytochemical analysis of the extract was performed following established methods. results: the extract showed good but varying in vitro activities against all the isolates tested. while ampicillin showed synergistic interaction with the plant extract against clinical isolates of e. coli and p. mirabilis, septrin was synergistic against the clinical isolate of e. coli only. similarly, the activity of the extract against c. albicans isolate was synergistic with ketoconazole and nystatin. conclusion: the study has validated the folkloric use of o. gratissimum in traditional medicinal practice and goes further to show that the use of this plant material as food spice may not really  threaten the efficacy of some conventional antibiotics that may have been taken concomitantly with it as is the popular belief in the practice of herbal medicine in local/rural communities of many countries in the world.

TI  == invasive bacteria isolates from children with severe infections in a nigerian hospital.
AB  == background: little information is available about the aetiology and epidemiology  of serious bacterial infections in nigeria. this study determined bacterial isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) of children presenting in the emergency room of a teaching hospital in nigeria. method: from october 2005 to december 2006, children aged two to 60 months presenting with signs of acute systemic infections were recruited. blood culture and csf specimens were collected and processed using standard microbiological protocols. data were analysed using spss version 11 software. results: two hundred and two blood and 69 csf samples were cultured. fifty-five (27%) of the blood cultures yielded gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci in almost equal proportions. the most common isolates from the blood cultures were staphylococcus aureus, 26 (12.9%) and atypical coliforms, 13 (6.5%). others are klebsiella spp, 3 (1.5%); klebsiella pneumonia, 2 (1.0%); escherichia coli, 3 (1.5%); enterobacter agglomerans, 2 (1.1%); proteus mirabilis, 2(1%); pseudomonas spp, 2 (1.0%); haemophilus influenza, 1 (1.0%); and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, 1 (1.0%). fourteen out of 67 (20.9%) of the csf samples yielded bacterial isolates: streptococcus pneumonia, 3 (4.5%); haemophilus influenza, 8 (11.9%); hemophilus spp, 1 (1.5%); e. coli, 1 (1.5%); and atypical coliform, 1 (1.5%). gram-negative  coliform isolates were predominantly resistant to penicillin based antibiotics and co-trimoxazole but sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones. a high percentage of s. aureus isolates were multi-drug resistant. conclusions: bacterial infections contribute to the significant morbidity among children in our environment. s. aureus was more frequently isolated in sepsis while h. influenzae appears to play a major role in meningitis. appropriate use of antibiotics is needed to manage affected children effectively. we also recommend improved vaccine coverage of children under the age of five years.

TI  == a multinational survey of risk factors for infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in nonhospitalized patients.
AB  == background: infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae are increasing in frequency and are associated with high mortality rates. circulation of ctx-m-type esbls in the community is of particular concern, because it may confound standard infection-control measures. methods: we analyzed the results of epidemiologic studies of infection caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in nonhospitalized patients from 6 centers in europe, asia, and north america. risk  factors for infection with an esbl-producing organism were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. results: a total of 983 patient-specific isolates were reviewed (890 [90.5%] of which were escherichia coli, 68 [6.9%] of  which were klebsiella species, and 25 [2.5%] of which were proteus mirabilis); 339 [34.5%] of the isolates produced esbls. ctx-m types were the most frequent esbls (accounting for 65%). rates of co-resistance to ciprofloxacin among esbl-producing isolates were high (>70%), but significant variation was seen among centers with respect to rates of resistance to gentamicin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. similar risk factors  for infection with an esbl-producing organism were found in the different participating centers. significant risk factors, identified by multivariate analysis, were recent antibiotic use, residence in a long-term care facility, recent hospitalization, age 65 years, and male sex (area under the receiver-operator characteristic [roc] curve, 0.80). however, 34% of esbl-producing isolates (115 of 336 isolates) were obtained from patients with no recent health care contact; the area under the roc curve for the multivariate model for this group of patients was only 0.70, which indicated poorer predictive value. conclusions: community-acquired esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae are now  prevalent worldwide, necessitating international collaboration. novel approaches  are required to adequately address issues such as empirical treatment for severe  community-acquired infection and infection control.

TI  == prevalence of ctx-m beta-lactamases in philadelphia, pennsylvania.
AB  == ctx-m beta-lactamases were thought to be rare in the united states, but a recent  study in texas showed that up to 70% of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-containing members of the enterobacteriaceae family were ctx-m positive (j. s. lewis, m. herrera, b. wickes, j. e. patterson, and j. h. jorgensen, antimicrob. agents chemother. 51:4015-4021, 2007). we used pcr to detect ctx-m in all 291 extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria isolated in our laboratory during 2007. thirty (48%) escherichia coli isolates, 6 (3%) klebsiella sp. isolates, and 7 (100%) proteus mirabilis isolates tested were ctx-m positive, with 15% of all enterobacteriaceae tested being positive. the e.  coli ctx-m groups were i (57%), iv (37%), ii (3%), and not groupable (3%); three  of the group iv isolates were positive for ctx-m-18, and three of the group i isolates were positive for ctx-m-15. one of seven positive p. mirabilis isolates  was in group ii, with the remainder being positive for a ctx-m-25-like beta-lactamase; and 33% of the klebsiella sp. isolates were in group i or iv, with the remainder not being in groups i to iv. ctx-m-producing bacteria were isolated from urine (n = 13), blood (n = 13), wounds (n = 12), and the respiratory tract (n = 4). all 31 ctx-m-positive isolates tested for the presence of esbl were confirmed to produce esbls by the use of tests recommended by the clsi. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of the ctx-m-positive isolates showed that six p. mirabilis isolates were clonal and that there were seven different e. coli clusters. five of seven p. mirabilis isolates were from blood cultures. the clsi  tests for the confirmation of esbl production reliably detect these isolates if both cefotaxime and ceftazidime are tested, but only about half would be classified as a possible ctx-m producers on the basis of the antibiogram alone. a new panprimer set increases the ability to detect ctx-m-producing strains. ctx-m-positive bacteria are common in our geographic region, are often invasive,  and, with the exception of p. mirabilis, are multiclonal.

TI  == detection of ampc beta-lactamases in escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., salmonella spp. and proteus mirabilis in a regional clinical microbiology laboratory.
AB  == there are currently no standardized diagnostic tests available for the reliable detection of ampc beta-lactamases in klebsiella spp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella spp. a study was designed to evaluate a confirmation disk test using cefotetan (ctt) and cefoxitin (fox) with phenylboronic acid (pba). it also investigated the most suitable screening concentrations of fox, ceftriaxone (cro) and ceftazidime (caz) for the detection of ampc beta-lactamases. a total of 126 control (consisting of 11 laboratory and 115 well-characterized clinical strains) and 29,840 non-repeat clinical isolates were included. fox with pba used in a confirmation test and cro and caz as screening agents were found to be unreliable. fox at >or= 32 mg/l was the best screening agent and ctt with pba was the best confirmation test. of the clinical isolates 635 (2%) were found to be resistant to cefoxitin (mic >or= 32 ug/ml) and 332 (52%) were ampc positive. e. coli was the most common organism with ampc beta-lactamases and was mostly present in urines from community patients. it is recommended that laboratories use fox at 32 mg/l as a screening agent and perform a disk test with ctt and pba to confirm the presence of an ampc cephalosporinase  in isolates of klebsiella spp., e. coli, salmonella spp. and p. mirabilis. this approach is convenient, practical and easy to incorporate into the workflow of a  clinical laboratory. false-positive ampc detection may occur with kpc-producing bacteria when inhibitor-based methods are used.

TI  == correlation between antibiotic consumption and bacterial resistance as quality indicator of proper use of these drugs in inpatients.
AB  == background/aim: antibiotics are the most frequently used medications in serbian hospitalized patients. information about antibiotic utilization and sensitivity among inpatients in serbia is scanty, and there are no available publications on  the topic. the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between antibiotic use and bacterial resistance in the clinical center nis, one of the biggest hospitals in serbia. methods: the data on antibiotics use in inpatients were obtained from the database of the department of pharmacotherapy and expressed as defined daily doses per 100 bed-days (dbd), during 2003-2007. bacterial resistances were given as percentages of resistant isolates. results: during the investigation period, the overall consumption of antibiotics had a significant decrease in 2007, by 22.99% (62.23 : 47.92 dbd; p < 0.05). the most frequently used antibiotics were cephalosporins, followed by penicillins, aminoglycosides and quinolones. hospital aminoglycosides consumption was reduced  in 2007 to 59.9% (13.4 : 5.53 dbd) while the resistance to amikacin was reduced from 40.88% to 32.1%. however, utilization of ciprofloxacin had a significant increase in 2007 (120.7%). there was an alarming increase in the level of resistance to ciprofloxacin in our hospital (from 13.5% to 28.3% in escherichia coli and from 11.1 to 30.09% in proteus mirabilis). reduction of e. coli resistant to amoxicillin+clavulanic acid correlated significantly with their utilization, while the resistance for all isolates decreased from 52.16% to 24.40%. conclusions: these results confirm an association between the use of antibiotics and the prevalence of resistance. this methodology could provide good quality indicators of rational drug use and serve for local monitoring of antibiotics use and resistance, as well as for external comparison.

TI  == comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the national institutes of health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  == we examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. the following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a croatian translation of the nih cpsi questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and stamey localization technique). patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in croatia. an infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), enterococcus in 36 (19%) and escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. in the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: ureaplasma urealyticum, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by e. coli and enterococcus (p<0.001). clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by c. trachomatis, enterococcus and e. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by t. vaginalis.

TI  == [etiology of urinary tract infections and antimicrobial susceptibility: a study conducted on a population of children hospitalized in the department of pediatrics at warsaw bielany hospital; 2004-2006].
AB  == background: the basis of urinary tract infection (uti) diagnosis in children is based on positive results of microbiological tests. the selection of an antimicrobial drug for empirical treatment and prophylaxis of uti is determined by the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from urine cultures. aim: determination of the etiology of urinary tract infections and drug sensitivity of the pathogen in hospitalized children. materials and methods: we performed quantitative analyses of 2522 urine cultures from children admitted to the department of paediatrics at warsaw bielany hospital, from january 2004 to december 2006. we obtained 456 positive urinary cultures, which accounted for 18.1% of urinary samples (14.7%; 17.9%; 21.2% in successive years). results: in 392 (86%) cases the urinary infection was caused by one of the isolated pathogens: escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. or proteus mirabilis. escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated pathogen (70-74%). we noted that the frequency of isolating of klebsiella spp. grew from 6 to 10%, whereas that of proteus mirabilis fell from 10 to 2% in the same years. likewise, in the period from 2004-2006 we observed the same level of the susceptibility of gram-negative  bacteria to nitrofurantoin (84-88%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (90-91%), whereas we observed a non-statistically significant lowering of susceptibility to aminopenicillins, and aminopenicillins combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors (from 92 to 74%; p=0.2). there was a statistically significant decrease in drug susceptibility to nitrofurantoin (from 86 to 60%; p<0.05). however, because the groups of children treated with nitrofurantoin were small (6-8-11 in successive years) further studies are needed. conclusion: studies into the etiology of uti and drug susceptibility of the pathogens in hospitalized children could facilitate correct management of patients receiving empirical treatment and prophylaxis of uti. of concern is the noted decrease in the sensitivity of the most frequent pathogen, escherichia coli, to aminopenicillins and aminopenicillins combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors.

TI  == integration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic indices of orbifloxacin in beagle dogs after a single intravenous and intramuscular administration.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics (pk) and pharmacodynamics (pd) of orbifloxacin were studied  in beagle dogs after intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administration at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight. an absolute bioavailability of 100.1% +/- 4.76%, a terminal half-life of 4.23 +/- 0.2 h and 3.95 +/- 0.15 h after i.v. and  i.m. administration, a steady-state volume of distribution of 1.61 +/- 0.13 liters/kg, and clearance of 0.31 +/- 0.03 liters/h/kg were observed. orbifloxacin showed rapid, concentration-dependent killing against the escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, and proteus mirabilis clinical isolates. computations based on pk-pd analysis indicated that the recommended dose is unlikely to be clinically effective against some strains like s. intermedius. therefore, a higher dose of orbifloxacin would be worthy of consideration for treatment of certain bacterial infections in dogs.

TI  == in vitro biological activity screening of lycopodium complanatum l. ssp. chamaecyparissus (a. br.) doll.
AB  == this article reports the results of selected biological activities, including anticholinesterase, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties, of the petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol extracts as well as the alkaloid fraction of lycopodium complanatum l. ssp. chamaecyparissus (a. br.) doll (lcc, lycopodiaceae) growing in turkey. anticholinesterase effect of the extracts was tested against both acetylcholinesterase (ache) and butyrylcholinesterase (bche) at concentrations of 0.2 and 1 mg ml(-1) using microplate-reader assay based on ellman method. antioxidant activity of the lcc extracts was evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical-scavenging method at 0.2 mg ml(-1) using microplate-reader assay. both dna virus herpes simplex (hsv) and rna virus parainfluenza (pi-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of lcc exracts using madin-darby bovine kidney and vero cell lines. antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were screened against the bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, acinobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis as well as the fungi: candida albicans and c. parapsilosis. only the petroleum ether extract of lcc possessed remarkable activity against both ache and bche at 1 mg ml(-1) (76.5 and 69.6%, respectively), whereas lcc extracts showed low free radical-scavenging activity. all of the extracts were found to be more effective against the atcc strains than isolated ones, particularly s. aureus, while the extracts had moderate antifungal activity. on the other hand, we found that only the petroleum ether extract was active against hsv. in addition, we also analysed the content of the alkaloid fraction of the plant by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and identified lycopodine  as the major alkaloid (60.8%).

TI  == pseudomonas aeruginosa las quorum sensing autoinducer suppresses growth and biofilm production in legionella species.
AB  == bacteria commonly communicate with each other by a cell-to-cell signalling mechanism known as quorum sensing (qs). recent studies have shown that the las qs autoinducer n-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-c(12)-hsl) of pseudomonas aeruginosa performs a variety of functions not only in intraspecies communication, but also in interspecies and interkingdom interactions. in this study, we report the effects of pseudomonas 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl on the growth and suppression of virulence factors in other bacterial species that frequently co-exist with ps. aeruginosa in nature. it was found that 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl, but not its analogues, suppressed the growth of legionella pneumophila in a dose-dependent manner. however, 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl did not exhibit a growth-suppressive effect on serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, escherichia  coli, alcaligenes faecalis and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. a concentration of 50 microm 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl completely inhibited the growth of l. pneumophila. additionally, a significant suppression of biofilm formation was demonstrated in  l. pneumophila exposed to 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl. our results suggest that the pseudomonas qs autoinducer 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl exerts both bacteriostatic and virulence factor-suppressive activities on l. pneumophila alone.

TI  == lysozyme catalyzes the formation of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles.
AB  == hen egg white lysozyme acted as the sole reducing agent and catalyzed the formation of silver nanoparticles in the presence of light. stable silver colloids formed after mixing lysozyme and silver acetate in methanol and the resulting nanoparticles were concentrated and transferred to aqueous solution without any significant changes in physical properties. activity and antimicrobial assays demonstrated lysozyme-silver nanoparticles retained the hydrolase function of the enzyme and were effective in inhibiting growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus anthracis, and candida albicans. remarkably, lysozyme-silver nanoparticles demonstrated a strong antimicrobial effect against silver-resistant proteus mirabilis strains and a recombinant e. coli strain containing the multiple antibiotic- and silver-resistant plasmid, pmg101. results of toxicological studies using human epidermal keratinocytes revealed that lysozyme-silver nanoparticles are nontoxic  at concentrations sufficient to inhibit microbial growth. overall, the ability of lysozyme to assemble silver nanoparticles in a one-step reaction offers a simple  and environmentally friendly approach to form stable colloids of nontoxic silver  nanoparticles that combine the antimicrobial properties of lysozyme and silver. the results expand the functionality of nanomaterials for biological systems and  represent a novel antimicrobial composite for potential aseptics and therapeutic  use in the future.

TI  == eca-immunogenicity of proteus mirabilis strains.
AB  == introduction: bacteria of the genus proteus are opportunistic pathogens and cause mainly urinary tract infections. they also play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (ra). patients suffering from yersinia-triggered ra often carry high titers of antibodies specific to enterobacterial common antigen (eca). the immunogenicity of eca has not received much attention thus far and studies have focused mainly on the eca of escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica. in this paper the eca-immunogenicity of proteus mirabilis is elucidated using two wild-type strains (s1959 and o28) as well as their rough (r) derivative strains r110/1959, which expresses lipopolysaccharide (lps) with a full core, and r4/o28, which expresses lps with only an inner core. materials and methods: rabbit polyclonal antisera were produced by immunization with boiled suspensions of the  four p. mirabilis strains. the antisera were tested for the presence of antibodies specific to eca by western blotting using glycerophospholipid- linked  eca (eca(pg)) of salmonella montevideo as antigen. lipopolysaccharide (lps) was isolated from the four strains by the hot phenol/water procedure in which eca(pg) is co-extracted with lps and by the phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether extraction  that results in the isolation of lps and/or lps-linked eca (eca(lps)) free of eca(pg). the lps preparations were tested for the presence of eca by western blotting using eca-specific antibodies. results: the results demonstrated that all four p. mirabilis strains were eca immunogenic. the rabbit antisera immunized by the four strains all contained eca-specific antibodies. analysis of the lps preparations demonstrated that the p. mirabilis wild-type strains o28 and s1959 and the ra mutant strain r110/1959 expressed eca(lps), suggesting that it induced the anti-eca antibody responses. only the presence of eca(pg) could be demonstrated in the rc mutant strain r4/o28. conclusions: these results therefore suggest that, similar to e. coli, lps with a full core is also required as the acceptor of eca for p. mirabilis strains to produce eca(lps). since eca(pg) is not immunogenic unless combined with some proteins, it is likely that eca(pg)-protein complexes formed during the intravenous immunization with the rc  mutant strain r4/o28.

TI  == catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  == urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, centre for paraplegia of the clinical centre of the university of sarajevo, were included. the patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: group a (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; group b (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; group c (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. from a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. more than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. the overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. the vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by proteus mirabilis (16,3%), escherichia coli (11,8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), morganella morgani (5,4%), acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were gram-positive with enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), providencia rettgeri (86,7%), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (85,4%), providencia stuarti (84,3%) and morganella morgani (81,0%). lower rates of resistance were found in group c, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. the analysis of group c showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two groups of patients. the objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. in addition, possible correlations between uti and the type of bladder  management were examined.

TI  == piscidin 4, a novel member of the piscidin family of antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == piscidins are linear, amphipathic, antimicrobial peptides (amps) with broad, potent, activity spectrum. piscidins and other members of the piscidin family appear to comprise the most common group of amps in teleost fish. all piscidins and related members of the piscidin family described to date are 18-26 amino acids long.we report here the isolation of a novel 5329.25 da, 44-residue (ffrhlfrgakaifrgarqgxrahkvvsryrnrdvpetdnnqeep) antimicrobial peptide from hybrid  striped bass (morone chrysops female x m. saxatilis male).we have named this peptide "piscidin 4" since it has considerable (to >65%) n-terminal sequence homology to piscidins 1-3 and this distinctive, 10 to 11-residue, n-terminus is characteristic of piscidins. the native peptide has a modified amino acid at position 20 that, based upon mass spectrometry data, is probably a hydroxylated tryptophan. synthetic piscidin 4 (with an unmodified tryptophan at position 20) has similar antibacterial activity to that of the native peptide. piscidin 4 demonstrates potent, broad-spectrum, antibacterial activity against a number of fish and human pathogens, including multi-drug resistant bacteria. its potent antimicrobial activity suggests that piscidin 4 plays a significant role in the innate defense system of hybrid striped bass.

TI  == [evaluation of the microscan negcombo panel type 44 for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase among clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and proteus mirabilis].
AB  == background: accurate and rapid detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is important in guiding proper antimicrobial therapy for infected patients. we evaluated the performance of microscan negcombo type 44 panel (dade  behring, usa), which was developed to confirm esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae using ceftazidime/clavulanate and cefotaxime/clavulanate. methods: from august 30 to september 20, 2007, 206 non-duplicate clinical isolates, including 106 escherichia coli, 81 klebsiella pneumoniae, 11 klebsiella oxytoca, and 8 proteus  mirabilis were subcultured and tested with type 32 and type 44 panels. the results were compared with those of the clsi phenotypic confirmatory test (clsi-pct) and disk approximation test (dat). isolates not susceptible to cefotetan or flagged as "possible esbl, unable to interpret confirm test (possible esbl)" on type 44 panel were tested with boronic acid disks to confirm  ampc beta-lactamases (ampc) production. results: of the 206 isolates tested, 44 (21.4%) produced esbl by clsi-pct or dat, including 27 e. coli, 14 k. pneumoniae, 2 k. oxytoca, and 1 p. mirabilis. thirty-eight isolates flagged as "confirmed esbl" on type 44 panel were all confirmed as esbl-producers. of 14 k. pneumoniae  flagged as "possible esbl", 6 were confirmed as esbl and ampc co-producers and 8  as ampc-producers. conclusions: type 44 panel showed an excellent performance in  detecting esbl-producing e. coli, klebsiella spp., and p. mirabilis. when flagged as "confirmed esbl", no other confirmatory test was necessary to report as esbl;  however, "possible esbl" required a differential test for ampc production.

TI  == new plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene, qnrc, found in a clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == since the discovery of qnra in 1998, two additional qnr genes, qnrb and qnrs, have been described. these three plasmid-mediated genes contribute to quinolone resistance in gram-negative pathogens worldwide. a clinical strain of proteus mirabilis was isolated from an outpatient with a urinary tract infection and was  susceptible to most antimicrobials but resistant to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. plasmid phs10, harbored by this strain, was transferred to azide-resistant escherichia coli j53 by conjugation. a transconjugant with phs10  had low-level quinolone resistance but was negative by pcr for the known qnr genes, aac(6')-ib-cr and qepa. the ciprofloxacin mic for the clinical strain and  a j53/phs10 transconjugant was 0.25 microg/ml, representing an increase of 32-fold relative to that for the recipient, j53. the plasmid was digested with hindiii, and a 4.4-kb dna fragment containing the new gene was cloned into puc18  and transformed into e. coli top10. sequencing showed that the responsible 666-bp gene, designated qnrc, encoded a 221-amino-acid protein, qnrc, which shared 64%,  42%, 59%, and 43% amino acid identity with qnra1, qnrb1, qnrs1, and qnrd, respectively. upstream of qnrc there existed a new is3 family insertion sequence, ispmi1, which encoded a frameshifted transposase. qnrc could not be detected by pcr, however, in 2,020 strains of enterobacteriaceae. a new quinolone resistance  gene, qnrc, was thus characterized from plasmid phs10 carried by a clinical isolate of p. mirabilis.

TI  == doripenem activity tested against a global collection of enterobacteriaceae, including isolates resistant to other extended-spectrum agents.
AB  == the emergence and rapid dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates among enterobacteriaceae coupled with increasing prevalence of stably derepressed and plasmid-borne ampc producers have rendered broad-spectrum cephalosporins and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations less effective. this scenario has required the use of carbapenems for treatment of infections caused by such organisms. in this study, the in vitro activities of doripenem and comparator agents against enterobacteriaceae, including esbl- and ampc-producing strains, were evaluated. a total of 36 614 isolates collected from more than 60 medical centers (2000-2007) were included and tested for susceptibility using reference methods and interpretive criteria,  except for doripenem (product package insert). overall, doripenem inhibited 98.7% of all enterobacteriaceae tested at <or=0.5 microg/ml. esbl rates were higher among klebsiella pneumoniae (from 7.7% to 44.0%, varied by geographic region), followed by escherichia coli (3.6-14.0%) and proteus mirabilis (0.8-34.8%). derepressed ampc production-mediated resistance rates were highest among enterobacter cloacae (26.6-38.7%) compared with other species and generally higher for strains isolated in the asia-pacific and latin american regions. doripenem inhibited 94.3% and 93.7% of the esbl phenotype and derepressed ampc isolates, respectively, and these resistances had little adverse influence on doripenem mic(50) values (nil to 2-fold increases). the observed increase in ampc- and esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae necessitates a greater confidence on  carbapenem empiric therapy. doripenem could represent a valuable choice for broad-spectrum coverage of contemporary enterobacteriaceae isolates with widespread resistance mechanisms.

AB  == objective: to address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (uti), we used 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia and proteus mirabilis. patients, subjects and methods: urine samples from patients with suspected uti (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of e. coli, k. pneumonia, p. aeruginosa, enterobacter, acinobacter, pr. mirabilis, citrobacter frundii, streptococcus saprophyticus and enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003  and 2006. 1h-nmr spectra were recorded on a 400 mhz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. all urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by nmr spectroscopy. results: preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the  unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of e. coli, 92% (101/110) of k. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of p. aeruginosa and eight of 10 pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with nmr (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). the remaining samples were  sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. the nmr method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) cfu. conclusions: the identification of the common uropathogens e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and pr. mirabilis by nmr spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.

TI  == comparison of pcr-based molecular markers for the characterization of proteus mirabilis clinical isolates.
AB  == proteus mirabilis is one of the most important pathogens associated with complicated urinary tract infections (acute pyelonephritis, bladder infections, kidney stones) and bacteremia, affecting patients with anatomical abnormalities,  immunodeficiency, and long-term urinary catheterization. for epidemiological purposes, various molecular typing methods, such as pulse-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) or ribotyping, have been developed for this pathogen. however, these methods are labor intensive and time-consuming. we evaluated the discriminatory power of several pcr-based fingerprinting methods (rapd, issr, eric-pcr, box-pcr and rep-pcr) for p. mirabilis clinical isolates. typing patterns and clustering analysis indicated that rapd, box-pcr and eric-pcr differentiated p. mirabilis strains from escherichia coli, hafnia alvei, and morganella morganii. with the exception of rep-pcr, the methods gave medium to high discriminatory efficiency in p. mirabilis. in general, the results obtained  with rapd, box-pcr and eric-pcr were in good agreement. we concluded that a combination of eric-pcr and box-pcr results is a rapid and reliable alternative for discrimination among p. mirabilis clinical isolates, contributing to epidemiological studies.

TI  == [distribution and drug resistance analysis of bacteria in different wound infections].
AB  == objective: to analyze the distribution and drug resistance of bacteria in different wound infections and provide evidence for wound infection control in subtropical regions. methods: this study involved 265 patients from 4 different departments of our hospital who experienced wound infections between july, 2007 and july, 2008. the bacterial strain distribution in the wounds and drug resistance of the bacteria were analyzed. results: acinetobacter baumanii (39% of the total strain identified) was the most frequent bacterial strain causing infection of the burn wounds, followed by proteus mirabilis (20%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). e. coli infection was prevalent in the departments of general surgery (37%) and urinary surgery (64%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas pneumonia infections were detected at the rate of 30% and 43% in the  urinary surgery department, respectively. different bacterial strains were found  at similar rates around 10% in the wounds of patients undergoing traumatic surgery. conclusion: despite that the commonly seen pathogenic bacteria in burn patients including staphylococcus aureus have been effectively controlled by early application of antibiotics, the opportunistic pathogens such as acinetobacter baumanii and proteus mirabilis often survive these antibiotics, and some strains evolve to be drug-resistant and even multi-drug-resistant. e. coli infection is prevalent in general surgery and urinary surgery departments, where  staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa infections can also be found frequently. all kinds of bacteria infection are present in trauma surgery department, each found at the rate around 10%.

TI  == isolation and identification of antibacterial compounds from thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and dianthus caryophyllus flower buds.
AB  == aim of the study: the aerial parts of thymus kotschyanus boiss. and hohen. (lamiaceae) and flower buds of dianthus caryophyllus l. (caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. in this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. materials and methods: compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: tlc, ftir spectra and hplc. the minimum inhibitory concentrations mic values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. results: two known compounds were isolated from the essential  oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. the isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thymol mic values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and b. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a mic value of 15.6 microg/ml. eugenol achieved stronger mic values against  most tested pathogens and the best mic value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes and k. pneumoniae whereas, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and e. coli were inhibited with a mic value of 31.2 microg/ml. combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the  best synergistic result was seen against p. mirabilis and e. coli. conclusions: the isolation of two antibacterial compounds from thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.

TI  == significance of the cyclic structure and of arginine residues for the antibacterial activity of arenicin-1 and its interaction with phospholipid and lipopolysaccharide model membranes.
AB  == arenicin-1 (ar-1) is a beta-sheeted antimicrobial peptide from the marine lugworm arenicola marina. to elucidate the significance of its unique 18-residue cyclic structure and of six cationic arginines for its biological activity and its interaction with biomembranes, we synthesized one linear peptide in which the two cysteines were exchanged for serines (c/s-ar-1) and a cyclic peptide in which all arginines were replaced by lysines (r/k-ar-1). we addressed antibacterial and hemolytic activities, the impact of the peptides on bacterial morphology, and their binding to, intercalation into, and permeabilization of model membranes composed of phospholipids or lipopolysaccharide (lps). in accordance with high salt concentration in sea water, the antibacterial activity of ar-1 was almost insensitive to high nacl concentrations. in contrast, the linear derivative lost  activity under these conditions against polymyxin b-resistant proteus mirabilis.  ar-1 intercalated into phospholipid and lps membranes and formed heterogeneous and short-lived lesions. however, when the peptide was present in both membrane leaflets, it formed defined pores. this characteristic was not observed for the linear derivative c/s-ar-1. apparently, the disulfide bond provides conforma-tional stability, which has an impact on salt tolerance, prevents fast degradation by trypsin, and is a prerequisite for the formation of structurally defined pores.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts. study object and methods: antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts was determined with reference cultures of staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 33499, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, proteus mirabilis atcc 12459, bacillus subtilis atcc 6633, bacillus cereus atcc 8035, and fungus candida albicans atcc 60193. microbiological tests were performed under aseptic conditions. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)--the highest dilution  of preparation (the lowest concentration of preparation) that suppresses growth of reference microorganisms--was determined. results: concentration of phenolic compounds in soft propolis extract that possesses antimicrobial activity against  gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis) is 0.587+/-0.054 mg and 0.587+/-0.054-0.394+/-0.022 mg (p>0.05) and in purified propolis extract--0.427+/-0.044 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (p>0.05). klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to soft propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.119+/- 0.152 mg and to purified propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.013+/-0.189 mg (p>0.05). spore-forming bacillus subtilis bacteria are more sensitive to soft and purified propolis extracts when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 0.134+/-0.002 mg and 0.075+/-0.025 mg, respectively, and bacillus cereus--when the concentration is 0.394+/-0.022 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (p>0.05). sensitivity of fungus candida albicans to soft and purified propolis extracts is the same as bacillus subtilis. encapsulated bacterium klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to antimicrobial action of soft and purified propolis extracts as compared with gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis bacteria (p<0.05), gram-negative  escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis (p<0.05), spore-forming bacillus subtilis and bacillus cereus bacteria (p<0.05), and fungus candida albicans (p<0.05). there is no statistically significant difference between antimicrobial effect of soft propolis extract and purified propolis extract on gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacteria, encapsulated bacteria, and candida fungus. conclusions: soft and purified propolis extracts possess antimicrobial activity. they could be recommended as natural preservatives in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.

TI  == ampc beta-lactamases.
AB  == summary: ampc beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. in many bacteria, ampc enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy.  transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for ampc enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(ampc) gene, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. resistance due to plasmid-mediated ampc enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. ampc enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. techniques to identify ampc beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates  this resistance mechanism. carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to ampc-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance  efflux (efflux pump activation).

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens responsible for community-acquired urinary tract infections in an italian community.
AB  == this study aimed to establish the pattern of the antimicrobial resistance among the leading uropathogens causing community-acquired utis in an area of the region of apulia, southern italy. twenty-one thousand and two hundred outpatients, 6,893 males and 14,307 females, were enrolled. urinary isolates were identified by conventional methods and the susceptibility to 18 antimicrobials determined. recognized uropathogens escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were isolated from 3175 positive samples, e. coli accounting for 68.04% of positive cultures. most overall resistance was to ampicillin, while the resistance rate to cephalothin was higher than that of third generation cephalosporins. although to a different degree, all the bacteria had an overall good susceptibility rate to quinolones as well as to fosfomycin but increased resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. our results confirm that e. coli is  the leading uropathogen and provide information about the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the main pathogens causing community-acquired utis. these findings should be taken into account to help maintain the safety and efficacy of treatment for community-acquired utis.

TI  == large scale multiplex pcr improves pathogen detection by dna microarrays.
AB  == background: medium density dna microchips that carry a collection of probes for a broad spectrum of pathogens, have the potential to be powerful tools for simultaneous species identification, detection of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. however, their widespread use in microbiological diagnostics is limited by the problem of low pathogen numbers in  clinical specimens revealing relatively low amounts of pathogen dna. results: to  increase the detection power of a fluorescence-based prototype-microarray designed to identify pathogenic microorganisms involved in sepsis, we propose a large scale multiplex pcr (lsplex pcr) for amplification of several dozens of gene-segments of 9 pathogenic species. this protocol employs a large set of primer pairs, potentially able to amplify 800 different gene segments that correspond to the capture probes spotted on the microarray. the lsplex protocol is shown to selectively amplify only the gene segments corresponding to the specific pathogen present in the analyte. application of lsplex increases the microarray detection of target templates by a factor of 100 to 1000. conclusion:  our data provide a proof of principle for the improvement of detection of pathogen dna by microarray hybridization by using lsplex pcr.

AB  == aim: to compare the survival of four bacterial strains (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa) in pharmaceutical oils, including jojoba oil/tea tree oil, carbol oil, jojoba oil and sesame oil. methods and results: oils were spiked with the test bacteria in a concentration of 10(4)  cfu ml(-1). bacteria were extracted from oils with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% tween 20. aliquots of the pooled water layers were analysed by solid-phase cytometry and plate counting. plate counts dropped to zero for all test strains exposed for 24 h to three of the four oils. in contrast, significant numbers of viable cells were still detected by spc, except in the jojoba oil/tea  tree oil mixture and partly in sesame oil. conclusions: exposure of bacteria for  24 h to the two oils containing an antimicrobial led to a loss of their culturability but not necessarily of their viability. the antibacterial activity  of the jojoba oil/tea tree oil mixture supersedes that of carbol oil. significance and impact of the study: these in vitro data suggest that the jojoba oil/tea tree oil mixture more than carbol oil inhibits bacterial proliferation when used for intermittent self-catherization.

AB  == herbal antimalarials still remain an alternative to our traditional communities who can not afford orthodox antimalarials. this study was aimed at investigating  the microbial quality of six herbal antimalarials using standard microbiological  methods. of the six preparations analyzed, "schnapps", palm wine and water were the media of preparation; the water base preparations recorded higher microbial load. the mean microbial load was 159.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml and 217.4 x 10(2)cfu/ml in water and alcohol base preparations respectively. the microbial profile of the preparations showed that the schnapps base preparations were predominantly contaminated with bacillus sp (aerobic spore bearers) and mucor spp. the palm wine preparation harboured bacillus sp, yeasts and mucor spp while the water base preparations had several isolates such as staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli 0157h7, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus feacalis, serratia marcensces, staph. aureus, bacillus spp and mucor spp. conclusively, this study underlines the public health importance of these preparations given the high burden of such human pathogen as ecoli o157h7, ps aeruginosa, stahp aureus, etc. in the preparations.

TI  == oxygen-limiting conditions enrich for fimbriate cells of uropathogenic proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli.
AB  == mr/p fimbriae of uropathogenic proteus mirabilis undergo invertible element-mediated phase variation whereby an individual bacterium switches between expressing fimbriae (phase on) and not expressing fimbriae (phase off). under different conditions, the percentage of fimbriate bacteria within a population varies and could be dictated by either selection (growth advantage of one phase)  or signaling (preferentially converting one phase to the other in response to external signals). expression of mr/p fimbriae increases in a cell-density dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. however, rather than the increased cell density itself, this increase in fimbrial expression is due to an enrichment of fimbriate bacteria under oxygen limitation resulting from increased cell density. our data also indicate that the persistence of mr/p fimbriate bacteria under oxygen-limiting conditions is a result of both selection (of mr/p fimbrial phase  variants) and signaling (via modulation of expression of the mrpi recombinase). furthermore, the mrpj transcriptional regulator encoded within the mrp operon contributes to phase switching. type 1 fimbriae of escherichia coli, which are likewise subject to phase variation via an invertible element, also increase in expression during reduced oxygenation. these findings provide evidence to support a mechanism for persistence of fimbriate bacteria under oxygen limitation, which  is relevant to disease progression within the oxygen-restricted urinary tract.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of pomegranate rind extracts: enhancement by addition of metal salts and vitamin c.
AB  == background: punica granatum l. or pomegranates, have been reported to have antimicrobial activity against a range of gram positive and negative bacteria. pomegranate formulations containing ferrous salts have enhanced although short-term, antibacteriophage activities which are rapidly diminished owing to instability of the ferrous combination. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activities of combinations of pomegranate rind extracts (pre) with a range of metals salts with the added stabiliser vitamin c. methods: pre solutions, prepared by blending rind sections with distilled water prior to sterilisation by autoclaving or filtration, were screened with a disc diffusion assay using penicillin g as a control. suspension assays were used to determine the antimicrobial activities of pre alone and in combination with salts of the following metals; fe (ii), cu (ii), mn (ii) or zn (ii), and vitamin c, against a  panel of microbes following exposure for 30 mins. the test organisms included staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. results: the screening assay demonstrated that  pre exhibited activity against the gram positive organisms at 24 h with no observable effect on any of the gram negative bacteria. however, after 12 h, zones of inhibition were only observed for ps. aeruginosa. in contrast, using the suspension assay, addition of cu (ii) salts to pre solutions extended the activities resulting in no detectable growth being observed for the pre/cu (ii) combination against e. coli, ps. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. minimal antimicrobial activity was observed following incubation with fe (ii), mn (ii) or zn (ii) salts alone or in combination with pre against any of the organisms in the test panel. the addition of vitamin c markedly enhanced the activities of both pre/fe (ii) and pre/cu (ii) combinations against s. aureus. conclusion: this is the first report demonstrating the enhanced efficacy of pre/metal salt combinations in the presence of the stabilising agent vitamin c, to which all isolates were sensitive with the exception of b. subtilis. this study has validated the exploration of pre along with additives such as metal salts and vitamin c as novel antimicrobial combinations.

TI  == a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  == it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the  bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have  identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies.  this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.

TI  == changing trend in antimicrobial resistance of pediatric uropathogens in taiwan.
AB  == background: there is growing concern regarding antimicrobial resistance worldwide, particularly of escherichia coli, and the first choice of an antimicrobial agent for empiric treatment of pediatric urinary tract infection (uti) is not well established. methods: the medical records from january 1991 to  december 2005 for all children under 18 years of age admitted to tri-service general hospital, taipei for their first uti were reviewed. two study periods, early (1991-2000) and late (2001-2005), were chosen during the 15 year period for evaluating the trend of antimicrobial resistance. results: of the 368 isolates, e. coli was the most common pathogen (81.0%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (6.5%), enterococcus spp. (6.0%), and proteus mirabilis (3.5%). of the 368 isolates, 77.4% were resistant to ampicillin, 44.6% to co-trimoxazole, 27.2% to cephalothin, 15.0% to gentamicin, and 8.4% to nitrofurantoin. in the early (1991-2000) and late (2001-2005) study periods, 199 isolates (54.1%) and 169 isolates (45.9%), respectively, were compared. the resistance to antimicrobial agents for overall pathogens in the early and late study periods, respectively, was as follows: 68.8% and 88.0% to ampicillin, 48.9% and 46.6% to co-trimoxazole, 26.8% and 28.9% to cephalothin, 16.2% and 19.8% to gentamicin, and 8.7% and 9.0%  to nitrofurantoin. conclusion: among commonly used antimicrobial agents for the treatment of pediatric uti, there is a trend towards increasing resistance to ampicillin and a persistently low resistance rate to gentamicin, cephalosporin, and nitrofurantoin. parenteral first-generation cephalosporins, gentamicin, and oral nitrofurantoin should be considered for first-line agents, given the resistance patterns of this study.

AB  == fluoroquinolones acts by interacting with type ii topoisomerases (dna gyrase and  topoisomerases iv). related to this mechanism of action, bacteria have developed  resistance mechanisms consisting in some target mutations (gyra/gyrb for dna gyrase and parc/pare for topoisomerase iv) or in a reduced access to the target itself, by either decreased permeability or augmented expression of efflux pumps, such as acrab and mexab. along with these classical mechanisms of chromosomal resistance, the presence of fluoroquinolones resistant proteins (qnr) has been recently evidenced, codified by transmissible genes by means of plasmids, especially in enterobacter spp., escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas proteus mirabilis and non fermenter gram-negative, like acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa, are not involved in such a kind of resistance. qnr proteins determine a slight increase in mic values, which often remains below the susceptibility breakpoint. more relevant is their impact on mpc values. additionally, new specific resistance mechanisms have been described. aac(6')-ib-cr represents the first enzyme able to inactivate, by acetylation, antimicrobials of two different classes, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. however, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, but not levofloxacin, are susceptible to  this enzyme action. finally, the presence of another resistance mechanism has been reported, an efflux-pump plasmid-mediated, codified by the qepa gene, which  acts by a selective mechanism. only hydrophilic fluoroquinolones, i.e. norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, but not all the other ones, i.e. levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, etc, are affected by this mechanism. in the light of these new information, it is clear that, in terms of bacterial resistance, it is not any more possible to assimilate one fluoroquinolones to another, since different molecules can be diversely active, due to the specific resistance mechanism.

TI  == characterization and sequence analysis of extended-spectrum-{beta}-lactamase-encoding genes from escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolates collected during tigecycline phase 3 clinical trials.
AB  == in concert with the development of novel beta-lactams and broad-spectrum cephalosporins, bacterially encoded beta-lactamases have evolved to accommodate the new agents. this study was designed to identify, at the sequence level, the genes responsible for the extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypes of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolates collected during the global tigecycline phase 3 clinical trials. pcr assays were developed  to identify and clone the bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(oxa), and bla(ctx) genes from clinical strains. isolates were also screened for ampc genes of the bla(cmy), bla(act), bla(fox), and bla(dha) families as well as the bla(kpc) genes encoding  class a carbapenemases. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis isolates with ceftazidime mics of > or =2 microg/ml were designated possible esbl-producing pathogens and were then subjected to a confirmatory test for esbls by use of etest. of 272 unique patient isolates, 239 were confirmed by pcr and sequencing to carry the genes for at least one esbl, with 44% of the positive isolates harboring the genes for multiple esbls. in agreement with current trends for esbl distribution, bla(ctx-m)-type beta-lactamase genes were found in 83% and 71% of the esbl-positive e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates, respectively, whereas bla(shv) genes were found in 41% and 28% of the esbl-positive k. pneumoniae and e. coli isolates, respectively. ninety-seven percent of the e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates were tigecycline susceptible (mic(90) = 2 microg/ml), warranting further studies to define the therapeutic utility of tigecycline against strains producing esbls in a clinical setting.

TI  == a rapid method for determining mycobacterium tuberculosis based on a bulk acoustic wave impedance biosensor.
AB  == the bulk acoustic wave impedance biosensor was set up and used to monitor the growth of mycobacterium tuberculosis (m.tb). this sensor is rapid, simple, sensitive (lower limit is 2 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)) and cheap (easy to generalize). the typical response curve was different from other bacteria's, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis. the frequency detection time was used to quantitatively determine m.tb. it was proportional to  logarithm of the initial concentration of m.tb in the range of 2 x 10(3)-3 x 10(7) cells ml(-1). the set up sensor was applied to the direct diagnosis of m.tb samples. the interference of other bacteria was eliminated by pretreatment. our results confirmed that the use of the set up biosensor was reliable, sensitive. it gives out the potential use for determining m.tb.

TI  == evaluation of screening methods to detect plasmid-mediated ampc in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == there are currently no standardized phenotypic methods for the screening and detection of ampc enzymes. this study aimed to evaluate different methods to detect ampc enzymes in escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and proteus spp., comparing the results from two disk-based methods and an agar dilution method. ampc activity was determined for 255 clinical isolates by use of a three-dimensional enzyme assay combined with a multiplex pcr assay for plasmid-borne ampc genes. these results were compared against a disk-based inhibitor assay using various combinations of cefpodoxime and cefoxitin as antibiotic substrates and boronic acid or cloxacillin as an ampc inhibitor. the presence of enzyme induction by disk approximation was evaluated using imipenem,  cefoxitin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate as inducing agents against ceftazidime. finally, an agar dilution assay was performed, using cefoxitin with and without added cloxacillin. ampc activity was present in 49.8% of test isolates, 93.7% of  which were positive for plasmid-borne ampc genes. cit-like enzymes were predominant in e. coli, and dha-like enzymes were predominant in klebsiella spp.  the disk-based inhibitor tests performed better than the agar dilution assay, while detection of ampc by disk induction had a poor sensitivity. the cefoxitin-cloxacillin disk combination provided the best overall performance, with a sensitivity and specificity of 95%. this study confirmed the accuracy of disk-based inhibitor screening for ampc enzymes, which proved reliable at detecting cit- and dha-like plasmid-borne ampc genes. the methods are simple enough for introduction into clinical microbiology laboratories.

TI  == uropathogens and host characteristics.
AB  == uropathogens other than escherichia coli occur with greater frequency in patients with risk factors for urinary tract infection (uti). however, little is known about associations between uropathogen species and host characteristics. three hundred nineteen urine specimens containing a balanced distribution of uropathogen species were selected from inpatients and outpatients at a university hospital clinical microbiology laboratory. information on host characteristics was retrospectively collected by chart review. differences in the frequencies of  host characteristics in uti groups, as defined by the causative uropathogen, were compared by chi-square/fisher analysis. multivariate classification and regression tree analysis were used to identify host characteristic subsets that distinguish among uropathogen groups. in this exploratory study, several uropathogen species were found to be strongly linked to host characteristics relevant to uti. patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa utis were more likely to have undergone urinary tract procedures (43% versus 15% overall), to have a neurogenic bladder (29% versus 12% overall), to have received recent antibiotic therapy (52% versus 24% overall), and to be male (76% versus 28% overall). patients with proteus mirabilis utis were more likely to have a foreign body in the lower urinary tract (48% versus 30% overall). the classification tree identified males over the age of 27 years who had undergone a prior urinary tract procedure as belonging to a host characteristic profile associated with p. aeruginosa uti: 38% of patients with p. aeruginosa utis fit this profile. these data may be useful for planning future targeted prophylaxis studies.

TI  == non-susceptibility trends among enterobacteriaceae from bacteraemias in the uk and ireland, 2001-06.
AB  == background: enterobacteriaceae are common agents of bacteraemia, with escherichia coli accounting for 20% of the cases. reflecting this importance, members of the  family constitute 4 of the 12 collection groups in the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy (bsac) bacteraemia surveillance programme. methods: mics from the bsac surveillance programme were reviewed, along with bacteraemia reports received by the health protection agency (hpa) via its cosurv/labbase system. isolates with unusual resistances were subjected to molecular analysis. results: the bsac and hpa systems both revealed dramatically increasing resistance to cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin among e. coli and klebsiella spp., with cephalosporin resistance largely contingent on the spread of ctx-m extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls); fluoroquinolone resistance also increased among proteus mirabilis and esbl-negative e. coli. carbapenem resistance remained extremely rare, but two enterobacter spp., from the same patient in different years, had kpc carbapenemases, while a few isolates had carbapenem resistance contingent upon combinations of beta-lactamase and impermeability, and ertapenem mics for ampc-derepressed enterobacter spp. rose over time. three new agents-ceftobiprole, doripenem and tigecycline-were tested.  ceftobiprole was broadly active, except against esbl producers and klebsiella oxytoca hyperproducing k1 enzyme, and was variable against ampc-derepressed enterobacter spp. and against proteus vulgaris. doripenem was more potent than imipenem. tigecycline was almost universally active against e. coli, but low-level non-susceptibility (mic 2 mg/l) was frequent among klebsiella spp. conclusions: e. coli and klebsiella spp. showed dramatic shifts, with sharply rising non-susceptibility to cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the rise in cephalosporin resistance reflected dissemination of ctx-m esbls. carbapenems remain broadly active and new agents offer potential.

TI  == [the analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to fess method].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

AB  == background: much controversy exists as to whether cephalosporin treatment is appropriate for infections caused by esbl-producing organisms because no randomized controlled studies have been performed. objective: evaluate the therapeutic outcomes of ceftriaxone treatment in acute pyelonephritis caused by esbl-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, or proteus mirabilis. material and method: the authors performed a prospective study in female patients hospitalized with acute pyelonephritis caused by esbl-producing or esbl-nonproducing e. coli, k. pneumoniae, or p. mirabilis in four hospitals in thailand from 2004 to 2006. the clinical and microbiological outcomes were evaluated at 72 hours after empirical ceftriaxone treatment. results: one hundred eleven patients with the mean age of 65.29 years participated in this study. there were no differences in demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory data between the esbl-producing and esbl-nonproducing groups except the higher rates of previous antibiotic use and urinary tract infection; and the  lower frequency of costovertebral angle tenderness in the esbl-producing group. both clinical (65% and 93%) and microbiological (67.5% and 100%) responses at 72  hours after ceftriaxone treatment were poorer in the esbl-producing group than in the esbl-nonproducing group (p < 0.0002). conclusion: to the authors' knowledge,  this is the first prospective study to evaluate the outcomes of ceftriaxone treatment in acute pyelonephritis caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae. the present study confirms that acute pyelonephritis in the female patients caused by esbl-producing strains could not be treated with ceftriaxone.

TI  == [lower urinary tract infections: bacterial epidemiology and recommendations].
AB  == lower urinary tract infection remains frequent particularly in women, despite improvement in therapeutic means. it seems likely to revisit bacterial epidemiology and therapeutic available strategies. to analyze elements in presence i.e. infecting bacteria and antibiotics still active or identification of acquired resistance mechanisms should permit to establish the evolution during the last 10 years. the study shows that bacterial epidemiology in urinary tract infection has not changed significantly, despite antibiotic selective pressure expected from overused antibiotics. however few enterobacteriaceae more resistant than escherichia coli have emerged, but the latter remains predominant. development of resistance has concerned negram, amoxicillin and augmentin, but several active molecules such as ciprofloxacin, monuril remain available. duration of treatments are still discussed but there is a tend toward short durations and even mono-doses. the control of lower urinary tract infections remains relatively easy provided that a good therapeutic choice is based on well  documented bacteriologic data (infecting species susceptible to the available antibiotics).

TI  == prevalence and mechanisms of broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: a children's hospital experience.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the trends and patterns of resistance in beta-lactamase-producing members of the family enterobacteriaceae in a children's hospital over a 9-year period (1999 to 2007). clinically significant isolates of the enterobacteriaceae were screened for patterns of broad-spectrum resistance to beta-lactams. the strains likely to be resistant were subsequently confirmed by an inhibitor-based disc test. the plasmid-mediated resistance determinants in these isolates were identified by pcr and by in vitro  transformation, which successfully reproduced the ampc phenotype unrestricted by  the species of the host organisms. among 8,048 enterobacteriaceae isolates belonging to the four chromosomal ampc-negative or -nonfunctional genera, 86 (1.07%) isolates (56 escherichia coli isolates, 22 klebsiella species isolates, 1 proteus mirabilis isolate, and 7 salmonella species isolates) exhibited broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance patterns. these organisms collectively produced three classes of beta-lactamases, including class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (n = 47), class c or ampc beta-lactamases (n = 36, including 4 isolates that produced both class a and class c enzymes), and class a or b carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases (n = 3). the proportion increased from 0.46% during the first 3 years to 1.84% during the last 3 years (relative risk [rr], 4.04; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.28 to 7.42; p < 0.001). the increase  was mainly due to the emergence of a plasmid-mediated bla(cmy-2) beta-lactamase,  the incidence of which increased from 0.11% during the first 3 years to 0.96% during the last 3 years (rr, 9.11; 95% ci, 2.76 to 30.1; p = 0.001). class a-type resistance increased slightly during the study period, from 0.35% during the first 3 years to 0.85% during the last 3 years (rr, 2.42; 95% ci, 1.15 to 5.07; p = 0.02). a proteus mirabilis strain was documented to possess a novel bla(dha) determinant. of special concern, three carbapenemase-producing isolates were identified between 2003 and 2006. the infections caused by resistant isolates of  the enterobacteriaceae mainly affected hospitalized patients with underlying conditions; however, 19 (22%) episodes were of community onset in otherwise well  children. the rate of resistance to broad-spectrum beta-lactams among isolates of the enterobacteriaceae is increasing in children in both hospital- and community-acquired settings, and the resistance is driven largely by plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases. these data have important implications for empirical antimicrobial strategies targeting serious pediatric infections. further study of this problem is warranted.

TI  == papx, a p fimbrial operon-encoded inhibitor of motility in uropathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == motility and adherence are two integral aspects of bacterial pathogenesis. adherence, often mediated by fimbriae, permits bacteria to attach to host cells and establish infection, whereas flagellum-driven motility allows bacteria to disseminate to sites more advantageous for colonization. both fimbriae and flagella have been proven important for virulence of uropathogenic escherichia coli (upec). reciprocal regulation is one mechanism by which bacteria may reconcile the contradictory actions of adherence and motility. papx, a p fimbrial gene product of upec strain cft073, is a functional homolog of mrpj of proteus mirabilis; ectopic expression of papx in p. mirabilis reduces motility. to define the connection between p fimbria expression and motility in upec, the role of papx in the regulation of motility of strain cft073 was examined. overexpression  of papx decreased motility of cft073, which correlated with both a significant reduction in flagellin protein synthesized and flagella assembled on the cell surface. conversely, an increase in motility and flagellin production was seen in an isogenic papx deletion mutant of cft073. microarray and quantitative reverse transcription-pcr analysis indicated that repression of motility of cft073 by papx appears to occur at the transcriptional level; expression of many motility-associated genes, including flhdc, the master regulator of motility, is  decreased when papx is overexpressed. transcription of motility genes is increased in the papx mutant compared to wild type. electrophoretic mobility gel  shift analysis revealed that papx binds to the flhd promoter. we conclude that synthesis of p fimbriae regulates flagellum synthesis to repress motility via papx.

AB  == chromosomal dna fragmentation may be a direct or indirect outcome of cell death.  unlike dna fragmentation in higher eukaryotic cells, dna fragmentation in microorganisms is rarely studied. we report an adaptation of a diffusion-based assay, developed as a kit, which allows for simple and rapid discrimination of bacteria with fragmented dna. intact cells were embedded in an agarose microgel on a slide, incubated in a lysis buffer to partially remove the cell walls, membranes, and proteins, and then stained with a dna fluorochrome, sybr gold. identifying cells with fragmented dna uses peripheral diffusion of dna fragments. cells without dna fragmentation show only limited spreading of dna fiber loops. these results have been seen in several gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as in yeasts. detection of dna fragmentation was confirmed by fluoroquinolone treatment and by dna breakage detection-fluorescence in situ hybridization. proteus mirabilis with spontaneously fragmented dna during exponential and stationary growth or escherichia coli with dna damaged after exposure to hydrogen peroxide or antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin or ampicillin, was clearly detected. similarly, fragmented dna was detected in saccharomyces cerevisiae after amphotericin b treatment. our assay may be useful  for the simple and rapid evaluation of dna damage and repair as well as cell death, either spontaneous or induced by exogenous stimuli, including antimicrobial agents or environmental conditions.

AB  == the o-specific polysaccharide (ops) isolated from the lipopolysaccharide of proteus mirabilis o36 was found to have a pentasaccharide repeating unit of the following structure: -->2)-beta-d-ribf-(1-->4)-beta-d-galp-(1-->4)-alpha-d-glcpnac6ac-(1-->4)-beta-d-g alp-(1-->3)-alpha-d-glcpnac-(1-->. the structure is unique among proteus ops, which is in agreement with the classification of this strain into a separate proteus o-serogroup. remarkably, the p. mirabilis o36-polysaccharide has the same structure as the ops of escherichia coli o153, except that the latter is devoid of o-acetyl groups. the cross-reaction of anti-o36 antibodies with the o-part of  e. coli o153 lipopolysaccharide is observed. in the present study, two steps of serotyping proteus strains are proposed: screening of dry mass with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot with the crude lipopolysaccharides. this method allowed serotyping of 99 p. mirabilis strains infecting the human urinary  tract. three strains were classified into serogroup o36. the migration pattern of these lipopolysaccharides fraction with long o-specific pss was similar to the standard laboratory p. mirabilis o36 (prk 62/57) lipopolysaccharide. the relatively low number of clinical strains belonging to serogroup o36 did not correspond to the presence of anti-p. mirabilis o36 antibodies in the blood donors' sera. twenty-five percent of tested sera contained a statistically significant elevated level of antibodies reacting with thermostable surface antigens of p. mirabilis o36. the presence and amount of antibodies correlated with thr399ile tlr4 polymorphism types (p=0.044).

TI  == asymptomatic bacteriuria in the elderly: high prevalence and high turnover of strains.
AB  == asymptomatic bacteriuria (asb) was followed in repeated prevalence surveys in a cohort of non-institutionalized residents (n=330), aged>or=80 y. urine samples were collected at baseline, and at 6, and at 18 months. phenotyping (pheneplate)  was performed on isolates of escherichia coli to evaluate strain relatedness. asb occurred in 19.0, 19.4, and 19.9% in women, and in 9.4, 9.6 and 7.9% in men, at baseline and at the 6- and 18-months follow-up, respectively, and asb was found at least once in 37% of women and in 20% of men. of those with asb at baseline, 60% also had asb in the 2 subsequent surveys. among those with persisting e. coli bacteriuria, 76% and 40%, respectively, carried the same strain at the 6- and 18-months follow-ups. in women, we found that the risk of developing a symptomatic urinary tract infection within 24 months was higher among those with  asb at baseline than in those without bacteriuria (p=0.019). asb is common and often persistent, but we found a high turnover of strains, indicating a high rate of recolonization.

TI  == surface acoustic wave biosensor as a tool to study the interaction of antimicrobial peptides with phospholipid and lipopolysaccharide model membranes.
AB  == surface acoustic wave biosensors are a powerful tool for the study of biomolecular interactions. the modulation of a surface-confined acoustic wave is  utilized here for the analysis of surface binding. phase and amplitude of the wave correspond roughly to mass loading and viscoelastic properties of the surface, respectively. we established a procedure to reconstitute phospholipid and lipopolysaccharide bilayers on the surface of a modified gold sensor chip to  study the mode of action of membrane-active peptides. the procedure included the  formation of a self-assembled monolayer of 11-mercaptoundecanol, covalent coupling of carboxymethyl-dextran, and subsequent coating with a poly- l-lysine layer. the lipid coverage of the surface is highly reproducible and homogeneous as demonstrated in atomic force micrographs. ethanol/triton treatment removed the lipids completely, which provided the basis for continuous sequences of independent experiments. the setup was applied to investigate the binding of human cathelicidin-derived peptide ll32, as an example for antimicrobial peptides, to immobilized phosphatidylserine membranes. the peptide-membrane interaction results in a positive phase shift and an increase in amplitude, indicating a mass increase along with a loss in viscosity. this suggests that the bilayer becomes more rigid upon interaction with ll32.

TI  == optimal probe length and target location for electrochemical detection of selected uropathogens at ambient temperature.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated the clinical validity of the rapid detection of uropathogens by use of a dna biosensor. this assay involves the hybridization of  capture and detector probe pairs with bacterial 16s rrna target molecules to form a dna-rna sandwich on the sensor surface. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody binds to the detector probe to enzymatically amplify the hybridization signal. these previous studies involved the hybridization of bacterial 16s rrna target sequences with 35-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs at 65 degrees c. achievement of point-of-care technology will be greatly facilitated by ambient-temperature detection. the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of probe length and target location on signal intensity using hybridization temperatures of 20 to 25 degrees c. signal intensity was found to vary dramatically with hybridization location in the species-specific bulge region of 16s rrna helix 18. probe pairs of as short as 10 nucleotides in length  were able to produce a significant electrochemical signal, and signal intensity was correlated with probe length for probes of 10 to 20 nucleotides in length. the sensitivity of the escherichia coli-specific 15-mer probe pairs was approximately 330 cells. these shorter probes allowed differentiation of klebsiella pneumoniae from proteus mirabilis 16s rrna target sequences differing  by a single nucleotide. a panel of oligonucleotide probe pairs ranging from 11 to 23 nucleotides in length was able to distinguish among seven groups of urinary tract pathogens. in conclusion, we have developed short oligonucleotide probe pairs for the species-specific identification of uropathogens at ambient temperature by use of an electrochemical sensor.

TI  == contemporary management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uutis) are common in adult women across the entire age spectrum, with mean annual incidences of approximately 15% and 10% in those aged 15-39 and 40-79 years, respectively. by definition, utis in males or pregnant females and those associated with risk factors known to increase the  risk of infection or treatment failure (e.g. acquisition in a hospital setting, presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, urinary tract instrumentation/interventions, diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression) are not considered herein. the majority of uutis are caused by escherichia coli (70-95%), with proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and staphylococcus saprophyticus accounting for 1-2%, 1-2% and 5-10% of infections, respectively. if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with uuti are present (e.g. dysuria, frequency, back pain or costovertebral angle tenderness) and there is no vaginal discharge or irritation present, the likelihood of uuti is >90-95%. laboratory testing (i.e. urinary nitrites, leukocyte esterase, culture) is not necessary in this circumstance and empirical treatment can be initiated. the ever-increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance of the common uropathogens in uuti has been and is a continuing focus of intensive study. resistance to cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) has made the empirical use of this drug problematic in many geographical areas. if local uropathogen resistance rates to  cotrimoxazole exceed 10-25%, empirical cotrimoxazole therapy should not be utilized (fluoroquinolones become the new first-line agents). in a few countries, uropathogen resistance rates to the fluoroquinolones now exceed 10-25%, rendering empirical use of fluoroquinolones problematic. with the exception of fosfomycin (a second-line therapy), single-dose therapy is not recommended because of suboptimal cure rates and high relapse rates. cotrimoxazole and the fluoroquinolones can be administered in 3-day regimens. nitrofurantoin, a second-line therapy, should be given for 7 days. beta-lactams are not recommended because of suboptimal clinical and bacteriological results compared with those of non-beta-lactams. if a beta-lactam is chosen, it should be given for 7 days. management of uutis can frequently be triaged to non-physician healthcare personnel without adverse clinical consequences, resulting in substantial cost savings. it can be anticipated that the optimal approach to the management of uutis will change substantially in the future as a consequence of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

TI  == surveillance study in europe and brazil on clinical aspects and antimicrobial resistance epidemiology in females with cystitis (aresc): implications for empiric therapy.
AB  == background: uncomplicated cystitis in females is among the most frequent infections in community. objective: to determine clinical aspects, epidemiology,  and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. intervention: patients were investigated clinically and with urinalysis and urine culture. measurements: this survey started in 2003 and ended in 2006 including 68 centres in nine european countries and in brazil. female patients between 18 and 65 yr with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and clinically evaluated. uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility tested for nine antimicrobials. results and limitations: clinical data of 4264 eligible patients  were analysed. a positive urine culture was found in 74.6%. within the 3018 pathogens, escherichia coli (e. coli) was most frequent (76.7%), followed by enterococcus faecalis (4.0%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (3.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%), and proteus mirabilis (3.5%). e. coli showed the highest rate  of susceptibility to fosfomycin (98.1%) followed by mecillinam (95.8%), nitrofurantoin (95.2%), and ciprofloxacin (91.8%). the lowest rate was found for  ampicillin (45.1%). for the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (96.4%), mecillinam (95.9%), ciprofloxacin (90.3%), and nitrofurantoin (87.0%). in all countries a susceptibility rate to e. coli above 90% was found only for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. the susceptibility rates varied significantly from country to country (p<0.0001), except for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. conclusions: despite wide cross-country variability of bacterial susceptibility/resistance rates to the other antimicrobials tested, fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin have preserved  their in vitro activity in all countries investigated. they may represent good options for the empiric therapy of female patients with uncomplicated cystitis.

AB  == objectives: the ctx-m-25 family of beta-lactamases is a closely related family of enzymes found rarely in the world. we aimed to describe the occurrence and to understand the dissemination of this extended-spectrum beta-lactamase family among enterobacteriaceae strains in our hospital. methods: fifty-four ctx-m-producing enterobacteriaceae strains collected from 2000 to 2005 were screened for bla(ctx-m-25) genes by pcr and sequencing. genetic relatedness was analysed by pfge. antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by vitek-2. plasmids encoding bla(ctx-m-25)-type genes were isolated, transformed and analysed by southern blot using a bla(ctx-m-25) probe. chromosomal location of bla(ctx-m-25)-type was studied by i-ceui restriction analysis. the bla(ctx-m-25)  genetic environment was characterized by pcr mapping and partial sequencing. results: ten out of 54 ctx-m-producing isolates (18.5%) carried bla(ctx-m-25) genes, including klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), escherichia coli (n = 3), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and proteus mirabilis (n = 2). isolates were genetically unrelated. four beta-lactamases were found: ctx-m-25, ctx-m-26, ctx-m-39 and ctx-m-41, a new member of the family (accession no. dq023162) that differed from ctx-m-25 in three amino acids, ala80val, val106ile and ile126ser. bla(ctx-m-25)-type genes were plasmid-mediated in all genera but p. mirabilis, organized in a class i integron and located downstream of an isecp1 element. the  genes were encoded on different plasmids with varying degree of similarities. several antibiotic-resistant determinants conferring resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides existed on the same integron. conclusions: bla(ctx-m-25) exists in israel in different enteric species. spread of these enzymes within and between species is due to transfer of plasmids with common regions and by dissemination of determinants encoding these genes. ctx-m-41, a novel member of this family, was identified in the chromosome of p. mirabilis.

TI  == first prize: novel uropathogen-resistant coatings inspired by marine mussels.
AB  == background and purpose: success in the prevention of urinary device infections has been elusive, largely due to multiple bacterial attachment strategies and the development of urinary conditioning films. we investigated a novel anti-fouling coating consisting of mussel adhesive protein mimics conjugated to polyethylene glycol (mpeg-dopa(3)) for its potential to resist conditioning film formation and uropathogen attachment in human urine. methods: model tio(2) -coated silicon disks ( approximately 75 mm(2)) were either coated with mpeg-dopa(3) or left uncoated and sterilized using ethylene oxide gas. for bacterial attachment experiments, coated and uncoated surfaces were separately challenged with bacterial strains comprising six major uropathogenic species for 24 hours at 37 degrees c in human pooled urine. starting inoculum for each strain was 10(5) cfu/ml and 0.5 ml was used per disk. following incubation, the disks were thoroughly rinsed in phosphate buffered saline to remove non-adherent and weakly-adherent organisms and cell scrapers were employed to dislodge those that  were firmly attached. adherent bacteria were quantitated using dilution plating.  representative disks were also examined using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray analysis, and live/dead viability staining. results: the  mpeg-dopa(3) coating significantly resisted the attachment of all uropathogens tested, with a maximum >231-fold reduction in adherence for escherichia coli gr-12, enterococcus faecalis 23241, and proteus mirabilis 296 compared to uncoated tio(2) disks. scanning electron microscopy and viability staining analyses also reflected these results and demonstrated the ability of the coating to resist urinary constituent adherence as well. conclusion: model surfaces coated with mpeg-dopa(3) strongly resisted both urinary film formation and bacterial attachment in vitro. future in vitro and in vivo studies will be conducted to assess whether similar findings can be demonstrated when these polymer coatings are applied to urologic devices.

TI  == effects of rifaximin on bacterial virulence mechanisms at supra- and sub-inhibitory concentrations.
AB  == rifaximin, a poorly absorbed rifamycin derivative, exhibited time-dependent bactericidal activity and at concentrations as low as 1/32 of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) caused morphological alterations in both susceptible and resistant bacterial strains. spontaneous rifaximin-resistant clones appeared with an incidence of 2.6 x 10(-7). the percentage of escherichia  coli cells cured of various plasmids ranged from: 4.5-70% (flac), 0-18% (pbp507), 7.7-43.8% (plasmid carrying esbl genes) and 22.4-41.6% (plasmid encoding toxin from etec mex264). 8.4-18.2 and <0.1-18% of staphylococcus aureus cells were cured (plasmid-mediated penicillinase), 9.5-58.6% of morganella morganii (esbl),  10.6-47.1% citrobacter freundii (esbl), 2.3-38.7% of proteus mirabilis (esbl) and 14.3-66.6% of klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl). rifaximin reduced plasmid transfer from donor to recipient strains by >99%. the mic of ceftazidime was reduced (2-4  dilutions) in the presence of rifaximin (0.5 x mic) in esbl producing strains. rifaximin lowered the viability and virulence of the bacteria even though they developed resistance to the compound. in conclusion, the present findings add new features to the microbiological characteristics of rifaximin and suggest that if  in vivo pathogens are exposed to sub-mics of the drug, not only are their physiological functions compromised, but gene virulence and antibiotic resistance are not fully expressed.

AB  == background: the salmonella genomic island 1 is an integrative mobilizable element (ime) originally identified in epidemic multidrug-resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium) dt104. sgi1 contains a complex integron, which confers various multidrug resistance phenotypes due to its genetic plasticity. previous studies have shown that sgi1 integrates site-specifically into the s. enterica, escherichia coli, or proteus mirabilis chromosome at the 3' end of thdf gene (attb site). methodology/principal findings: here, we report the transfer of sgi1 to a delta thdf mutant of s. typhimurium lt2. in the absence of  thdf, the frequency of transconjugant formation was reduced by around thirty times of magnitude. through dna sequencing sgi1 was shown to integrate specifically into a secondary attachment site (2(nd)attb), which is located in the intergenic region between the chromosomal sodb and purr genes. at this 2(nd)attb site, we found that a significant fraction of sgi1 transconjugants (43% of wild type and 100% of delta thdf mutant) contained tandem sgi1 arrays. moreover, in wild type s. typhimurium lt2 transconjugants, sgi1 integrated into both attachment sites, i.e., thdf and sodb-purr. the formation of sgi1 tandem arrays occurred in both specific attb sites. there was heterogeneity in the size  of the sgi1 tandem arrays detected in single transconjugant colonies. some arrays consisted as far as six sgi1s arranged in tandem. these tandem arrays were shown  to persist during serial passages with or without antibiotic selection pressure.  conclusions/significance: the ability of integration into two distinct chromosomal sites and tandem array formation of sgi1 could contribute to its spread and persistence. the existence of a secondary attachment site in the salmonella chromosome has potential implications for the mobility of sgi1, which  may integrate in other attachment sites of other bacterial pathogens that do not  possess the 1(st) or 2(nd) specific sgi1 attb sites of salmonella.

AB  == background: bacterial genome sequences are being determined rapidly, but few species are physiologically well characterized. predicting regulation from genome sequences usually involves extrapolation from better-studied bacteria, using the  hypothesis that a conserved regulator, conserved target gene, and predicted regulator-binding site in the target promoter imply conserved regulation between  the two species. however many compared organisms are ecologically and physiologically diverse, and the limits of extrapolation have not been well tested. in e. coli k-12 the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (lrp) affects expression of approximately 400 genes. proteus mirabilis and vibrio cholerae have highly-conserved lrp orthologs (98% and 92% identity to e. coli lrp). the functional equivalence of lrp from these related species was assessed. results: heterologous lrp regulated gltb, livk and lrp transcriptional fusions in an e. coli background in the same general way as the native lrp, though with significant differences in extent. microarray analysis of these strains revealed  that the heterologous lrp proteins significantly influence only about half of the genes affected by native lrp. in p. mirabilis, heterologous lrp restored swarming, though with some pattern differences. p. mirabilis produced substantially more lrp than e. coli or v. cholerae under some conditions. lrp regulation of target gene orthologs differed among the three native hosts. strikingly, while lrp negatively regulates its own gene in e. coli, and was shown to do so even more strongly in p. mirabilis, lrp appears to activate its own gene in v. cholerae. conclusion: the overall similarity of regulatory effects of the lrp orthologs supports the use of extrapolation between related strains for general purposes. however this study also revealed intrinsic differences even between orthologous regulators sharing >90% overall identity, and 100% identity for the dna-binding helix-turn-helix motif, as well as differences in the amounts of those regulators. these results suggest that predicting regulation of specific target genes based on genome sequence comparisons alone should be done on a conservative basis.

TI  == the establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == pharmacodynamic performance of tigecycline versus common intravenous antibiotics  for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == background: in clinical trials tigecycline was similar to vancomycin/aztreonam for complicated skin and skin structure infections, but data comparing it with other widely used antibiotics are lacking. we predicted the pharmacodynamic cumulative fraction of response (cfr) of tigecycline against bacteria implicated  in complicated skin and skin structure infections and compared it with the cfrs for piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and imipenem/cilastatin.  methods: a 5,000-patient monte carlo simulation using a two-compartment intravenous infusion model was used to simulate steady-state concentrations for common dosages of these antibiotics. population pharmacokinetics data from infected patients were employed. the cfr was calculated against staphylococcus aureus (42% methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa]), streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, escherichia coli, enterobacter, enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella, and pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from worldwide surveillance (test and sentry) and weighted by prevalence of involvement in complicated skin and skin structure infections. results: excluding mrsa, the weighted cfr was greatest for imipenem/cilastatin and piperacillin/tazobactam regimens (93.9%-95.9%). with 42% mrsa added to the model, only tigecycline monotherapy achieved a high cfr (88.2%). the addition of vancomycin raised the cfr to 91.0%, 89.5%, 88.3%, 82.9%, and 78% for imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg q6h, imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg q8h, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone regimens, respectively. conclusion: tigecycline monotherapy had a likelihood of achieving its requisite pharmacodynamic exposure similar to that of combinations of piperacillin/tazobactam or imipenem/cilastatin plus vancomycin for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates from respiratory care wards in taiwan: a horizontal surveillance study.
AB  == a horizontal surveillance study was conducted to identify common bacteria and mycobacteria from 611 respiratory aspirates and 165 urinary samples from 611 patients hospitalised at 17 respiratory care wards (rcws) in taiwan. some major resistance phenotypes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas  aeruginosa (mdr-pa) and acinetobacter baumannii (mdr-ab), were identified. pulsotypes of esbl-producing p. mirabilis isolates were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the prevalences of mrsa, esbl-producing e. coli (k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis), carbapenem-resistant (resistant to imipenem and meropenem) p. aeruginosa, mdr-pa, carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii and mdr-ab were, respectively, 86.7%, 20.0% (50.7% and 24.1%), 18.4%, 1.2%, 32.1% and 8.9% for respiratory aspirates and 100%, 25.4% (27.3% and 25.0%), 48.3%, 10.3%, 50.0%  and 21.4% for catheterised urinary samples. among the 44 respiratory isolates of  p. mirabilis with an esbl phenotype, 22 different pulsotypes (>80% identity) were identified. among 103 isolates of mycobacteria, 90 (87.4%) belonged to rapidly growing mycobacteria and 4 (4%) were mycobacterium tuberculosis. among the 404 patients with available clinical information, true infections were found in 28.0%, the most prevalent of which were urinary tract infection (20.5%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10.9%). high prevalences of various multidrug-resistant bacteria among the respiratory and urinary tracts of patients present a clinical difficulty in choosing empirical antibiotic treatment in rcws.

TI  == comparative activity of meropenem in us medical centers (2007): initiating the 2nd decade of mystic program surveillance.
AB  == since 1997, the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program has monitored the antimicrobial activity of broad-spectrum agents against pathogens from hospitalized patients. in the united states, 2894 isolates were submitted in 2007 from 15 sites, including 1392 enterobacteriaceae, 643 nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, and 829 gram-positive cocci. all isolates were tested by broth microdilution methods. meropenem (mic(90) range, 0.12-2 microg/ml) exhibited the lowest resistance rates (1.9-2.4%) against enterobacteriaceae, and fluoroquinolones had the highest rates of resistance (17.3-18.3%). kpc carbapenemases, usually found in klebsiella pneumoniae, were also detected in citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli. confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolate rates for e. coli, klebsiella spp., and proteus mirabilis isolates were 6.0%, 12.0%, and 0.0%, respectively. meropenem remained active against gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococci (methicillin-susceptible; mic(90), 0.12-0.25 microg/ml), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml), and beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci (mic(90) range, 0.06-0.25 microg/ml). these us mystic program results demonstrate the continued emergence of novel beta-lactamases and  multidrug-resistant bacterial phenotypes necessitating monitoring of carbapenem activities against enterobacteriaceae species as well as nonfermentative bacilli.

TI  == identification of an inhibitor of the murc enzyme, which catalyzes an essential step in the peptidoglycan precursor synthesis pathway.
AB  == the pathway for synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor udp-n-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is essential in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. this pathway has been exploited in the recent past to identify potential new antibiotics as inhibitors of one or more of the mur enzymes. in the present study, a high-throughput screen was employed to identify potential inhibitors of  the escherichia coli murc (udp-n-acetylmuramic acid:l-alanine ligase), the first  of four paralogous amino acid-adding enzymes. inhibition of atp consumed during the murc reaction, using an adaptation of a kinase assay format, identified a number of potential inhibitory chemotypes. after nonspecific inhibition testing and chemical attractiveness were assessed, c-1 emerged as a compound for further  characterization. the inhibition of murc by this compound was confirmed in both a kinetic-coupled enzyme assay and a direct nuclear magnetic resonance product detection assay. c-1 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of the e. coli murc reaction, with preferential inhibition by one of two enantiomeric forms. experiments indicated that it was a competitive inhibitor of atp binding to the murc enzyme. further work with murc enzymes from several bacterial sources revealed that while the compound was equally effective at inhibiting murc from genera (proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae) closely related to e. coli,  murc enzymes from more distant gram-negative species such as haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baylyi, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not inhibited.

TI  == viper metalloproteinase (agkistrodon halys pallas) with antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  == metalloproteinases are abundant enzymes in crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms. snake venom metalloproteinases (svmps) comprise a family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which display many different biological activities. a 23.1 kda protein was isolated from agkistrodon halys (pallas, chinese viper) snake venom. the toxin is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23146.61 and an n-terminal sequence (miqvllvticlavfpyqgssiiles) relatively similar to that of other metalloprotein-like proteases isolated from the snake venoms of the viperidae family. the antibacterial effect of agkistrodon halys metalloproteinase (ahm) on burkholderia pseudomallei (strains tes and khw), escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative bacteria) and staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive bacterium) was studied at a concentration 120 microm. interestingly, we found that the metalloproteinase exhibited antibacterial properties and was more active against s. aureus, p. vulgaris, p. mirabilis and multi-drug resistant b. pseudomallei (strain khw) bacteria. ahm variants with high bacteriostatic activity (mic 1.875-60 microm) also tended to be less cytotoxic against u-937 human monocytic cells up to 1 mm concentrations. these results suggest that this  metalloprotein exerts its antimicrobial effect by altering membrane packing and inhibiting mechanosensitive targets.

TI  == complicated catheter-associated urinary tract infections due to escherichia coli  and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == catheter-associated urinary tract infections (cautis) represent the most common type of nosocomial infection and are a major health concern due to the complications and frequent recurrence. these infections are often caused by escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. gram-negative bacterial species that cause cautis express a number of virulence factors associated with adhesion, motility, biofilm formation, immunoavoidance, and nutrient acquisition as well as factors that cause damage to the host. these infections can be reduced by limiting catheter usage and ensuring that health care professionals correctly use closed-system foley catheters. a number of novel approaches such as condom and suprapubic catheters, intermittent catheterization, new surfaces, catheters with  antimicrobial agents, and probiotics have thus far met with limited success. while the diagnosis of symptomatic versus asymptomatic cautis may be a contentious issue, it is generally agreed that once a catheterized patient is believed to have a symptomatic urinary tract infection, the catheter is removed if possible due to the high rate of relapse. research focusing on the pathogenesis of cautis will lead to a better understanding of the disease process and will subsequently lead to the development of new diagnosis, prevention, and treatment options.

TI  == the high-affinity phosphate transporter pst is a virulence factor for proteus mirabilis during complicated urinary tract infection.
AB  == proteus mirabilis is a ubiquitous bacterium associated with complicated urinary tract infection (uti). mutagenesis studies of the wild-type strain hi4320 in the  cba mouse model of ascending utis have identified attenuated mutants with transposon insertions in genes encoding the high-affinity phosphate transporter pst (psts, psta). the transcription of the pst operon (pstscab-phou) and other members of the phosphate regulon of escherichia coli, including alkaline phosphatase (ap), are regulated by the two-component regulatory system phobr and  are repressed until times of phosphate starvation. this normal suppression was relieved in psts::tn5 and psta::tn5 mutants, which constitutively produced ap regardless of growth conditions. no significant growth defects were observed in vitro for the pst mutants during the independent culture or coculture studies in  rich broth, phosphate-limiting minimal salts medium, or human urine. mutants complemented with the complete pst operon repressed ap synthesis in vitro and colonized the mouse bladder in numbers comparable to the wild-type strain hi4320. therefore, the pst transport system imparts a significant in vivo advantage to wild-type p. mirabilis that is not required for in vitro growth. thus, the pst transporter has satisfied molecular koch's postulates as a virulence factor in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection caused by p. mirabilis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils of ocimum gratissimum l. from different  populations of kenya.
AB  == hydro-distilled volatile oils from the leaves of ocimum gratissimum l. (lamiaceae) of 13 populations of different silvicultural zones were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against gram positive (staphylococcus aereus, bacillus spp.) and gram negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, samonella typhi, klebisiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis) bacteria and a pathogenic fungus, candida albicans. all the essential oils are active to the tested microbiles with different strength. the highest antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosae and proteus mirabilis) was observed from the eastern kenya (meru) oil. meru oil was the best and its effectiveness was consistent on nearly all the microbes tested. the oil from the plant growing in the coastal region of kenya (mombasa) showed the best effect only on gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis). both oils (meru and mombasa) were dominated by monoterpenes accounting for 92.48% and 81.37% respectively. the monoterpene fraction was characterized by a high percentage of eugenol (68.8%) for meru oil and 74.10% for mombasa oil. the other major monoterpene was methyl eugenol (13.21%). camphor (0.95%) was observed only in the meru oil. (cis)-ocimene, (trans)-ocimene and beta-pinene were present in both meru and mombasa oils. the sesquiterpenes present in fairly good amounts in both oils were germacrene d and (trans)-caryophyllene. the minor sesquiterpenes were alpha-farnesene (0.85%) and beta-bisabolene (0.74%) which were present in the meru oil only.

TI  == fournier's gangrene: ten-year experience in a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background and purpose: fournier's gangrene is a life-threatening infection. the  mortality is still high despite the rapid advancement of modern intensive care and surgical technique. in this study, we present our institution's recent experience with a large series of patients with fournier's gangrene. methods: a retrospective chart review was performed including 44 consecutive patients with fournier's gangrene over a 10-year period. results: the 44 cases comprised 39 males and 5 females, with a mean age of 55.5 years. the mean duration of hospitalization was 27.9 days. overall mortality was 22.7%. diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and chronic renal insufficiency were the 5 leading predisposing factors. liver cirrhosis was highly related to mortality (p=0.009). the etiologic origin of the gangrene was colorectal, urological and dermatological in 52.3%, 25.0%, and 11.4% of patients, respectively. the most common isolated pathogens were escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus spp., and proteus mirabilis. there were a total of 74 debridements. other related surgical procedures were reconstruction surgery (n = 18), colostomy (2), cystostomy (1), vasectomy (1), orchiectomy (1) and penectomy (1). major complications of fournier's gangrene, including respiratory failure, renal failure, septic shock,  hepatic failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, were significantly to mortality (p<0.05). conclusions: early diagnosis, intensive medical care (aggressive resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics), and prompt and repeated surgical intervention are the mainstays of treatment. liver cirrhosis in particular is a poor prognostic factor. reconstructive surgery should also be a consideration once the acute condition has improved. patients with comorbid condition, serious infection, and major complications should be treated carefully and aggressively.

AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == characterization of antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  == five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. twenty-two antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at terra nova bay (ross sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. escherichia coli  and proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis. none of the isolates inhibited the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus candida albicans. active antarctic isolates, identified by 16s  rdna sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-proteobacteria (6 strains). inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of antarctic marine  bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.

TI  == activities of the frog skin peptide, ascaphin-8 and its lysine-substituted analogs against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing bacteria.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing gram-negative bacteria are becoming increasingly prevalent and their antibiotic resistance necessitates novel therapeutic intervention. ascaphin-8 is a cationic alpha-helical peptide that shows broad-spectrum antibacterial activity but is also toxic to human erythrocytes (lc(50)= 55 microm). this study assesses the activity of ascaphin-8, and a series of l-lysine-substituted analogs, against a range of clinical isolates of esbl-producing bacteria. all esbl-producing escherichia coli (mic=1.5-6 microm) and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic=12.5-25 microm) strains tested  were susceptible to ascaphin-8, as well as a group of miscellaneous esbl-producing strains (citrobacter, salmonella, serratia, shigella spp.) (mic< or = 25 microm). the lys4- and lys8-substituted analogs were generally the most potent against bacteria but showed the highest hemolytic activity. however, the lys10, lys14, and lys18 analogs also displayed potent antibacterial activity while showing very low hemolytic activity (lc50> 500 microm). an unexpected finding was the susceptibility of esbl-producing proteus mirabilis strains to ascaphin-8 (mic=12.5-25 microm) and its lys4-substituted analog (mic= 6 microm),  although non-esbl isolates of this organism were resistant to these peptides (mic> 100 microm).

AB  == aims: this study investigated the prevalence of plasmid-mediated ampc production  in selected clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella species and proteus mirabilis, and compared the results of boronic acid disc screening with conventional susceptibility testing for the detection of ampc-positive isolates.  methods: e coli, klebsiella species and p mirabilis with reduced susceptibility to amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and cephalexin, but without phenotypic evidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were screened for ampc activity using enzyme-extraction methods. the presence of plasmid-mediated ampc was determined by multiplex pcr. antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using both disc and dilution-based methods. a disc-based screening method for detection of ampc-producing strains was evaluated using boronic acid as an inhibitor of ampc, and cefoxitin as the antibiotic substrate. results: plasmid-mediated ampc was present in 26% of study isolates, with cmy-like enzymes detected predominantly in e coli and dha-like enzymes predominantly in klebsiella pneumoniae. current susceptibility methods failed to detect a significant proportion of plasmid-mediated ampc-producing isolates, with 33% of such strains  interpreted as susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins using current clinical laboratory standards institute breakpoints. the boronic acid disc method showed sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 98% respectively in detecting ampc-positive isolates. conclusion: the prevalence of plasmid-mediated ampc was high in the study population, and may be missed by conventional susceptibility testing methods. inhibitor-based screening methods would improve detection of this emerging resistance phenotype.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis is not a rare entity in last two decades.
AB  == the aim of this short note is to assess gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis (cbm) and nosocomial meningitis (nm) within 17 years nationwide survey. all cases of gram-negative bacillary cbm within 1990-2007 were assessed in national database of 372 patients with bacterial meningitis: 69 of gram-negative cases were nosocomial and 24 of gram-negative meningitis cases were cbm. those 24 cases were compared with all cbm (201 cases) for risk factors and outcome. among nosocomial gram-negative pathogens, a. baumannii in 23 cases, ps.  aeruginosa in 15 cases and enterobacteriaceae in 31 cases were isolated. among cbm, in 13 cases enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli 6, klebsiella pneumoniae 3, proteus mirabilis 2, enterobacter cloacae 2), in 5 cases ps. aeruginosa and in 6  cases acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (csf). the only significant risk factor for cbm due to gram-negative bacilli was neonatal age (12.5% vs. 3.5%, p=0.04) as underlying disease. however, mortality among gram-negative bacillary meningitis was significantly higher (12.4% vs. 37.5%, p=0.001) in comparison to other meningitis.

TI  == the clinical development and launch of amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment  of a range of community-acquired infections.
AB  == by the 1960s and 1970s, problems in the antibacterial treatment of infections had begun to emerge. previously active antibacterials were being compromised by the development of resistance. beta-lactamase production was identified in isolates of staphylococci, and, amongst others, in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. the discovery of the potent beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, and its protective effect on amoxicillin, a semi-synthetic penicillin with good oral absorption and potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, was thus of great importance in the treatment of bacterial disease. following preliminary clinical studies in bronchitis and urinary tract infections, amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy was investigated in a wide range of infections and proved to demonstrate a high level of clinical efficacy. these results supported the launch of amoxicillin/clavulanate (augmentin) in 1981 for use in upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections and obstetric, gynaecological and intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == the antimicrobial resistance is coded in genetic elements which generate a horizontal flow of information, particularly in conditions that are under strong  selective pressure like the nosocomial environment. in that sense, in the last decades, gram negative bacilli have become important agents of nosocomial infection. in order to investigate the presence of integrons among clinical isolates of gram negative bacilli and their relationship with their resistance profile, we studied 88 strains isolated from clinical specimens of different wards of the hospital torres galdames, during the june-december period, 2004. they were identified according to biochemical tests. the antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated by agar diffusion method. the integron presence was  investigated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). a cluster analysis was carried out to study the relationship between the presence of integrons and the resistance profile. the genotyping of the isolates was carried out by eric-pcr technique. results: of the isolated strains, 18% corresponded to proteus mirabilis, 17% to escherichia coli, and 32% to non fermentative gram negative bacilli. most isolates presented high resistance to the antibiotics studied: 83%  to ampicillin, 85% to cephalotin, 82% to ceftriaxone, 82% to ciprofloxacin, 81% to gentamycin and 82% to cotrimoxazole. seventy-five % of the 88 strains presented integrons. class 2 integrons were found to be the most common. the results of the cluster analysis did not show a clear relationship among the presence of the integrons and the resistance profile. with the available information it is not possible to relate the integron presence with a certain resistance pattern. the patterns of bands obtained with the technique eric-pcr revealed a great genetic variety among the analyzed isolations, defining diverse  genotypes, distributed in the different services of the hospital where they were  isolated.

TI  == species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  == previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of  proteus mirabilis. in the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, p. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which p. mirabilis encrusts catheters. in the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with p. mirabilis, when escherichia coli, morganella morganii or enterobacter cloacae were present, p. mirabilis was rarely or never found. the hypothesis that the absence of p. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of p. mirabilis with m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli had  no effect on the ability of p. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. co-infection with ent. cloacae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly  increased the time that catheters took to block (p <0.05). the growth of ent. cloacae, m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with p. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. in the  case of ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (p < or =0.01). in all cases, however, p. mirabilis was able to  generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. the results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between p. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with p. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.

AB  == the overall expected coverage for tigecycline and selected antimicrobial regimens based upon prevailing susceptibility rates was evaluated for the empirical therapy of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssis). consecutive,  non-duplicate bacterial isolates collected from 2000-2005 from patients with documented csssi in 57 medical centres located in the usa (38 centres), france (6 centres), germany (7 centres), italy (3 centres) and spain (3 centres) were used  to evaluate the frequency of pathogen occurrence and susceptibility rates of select parenteral antimicrobials (sentry program). by applying pathogen-specific  susceptibility rates to the frequency of pathogen occurrence in each country, the overall expected coverage for each treatment regimen was measured. the most frequently isolated pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (33.3-49.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3-17.2%), escherichia coli (6.6-13.9%) and enterococci  (4.1-8.8%). tigecycline was highly active against the most common pathogens, except for p. aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. the highest overall expected empirical coverage was obtained with combination therapy regimens, including vancomycin plus either imipenem (94.4-99.3%) or piperacillin/tazobactam (92.5-98.2%). among the monotherapy regimens evaluated, tigecycline provided the  highest overall expected coverage in the usa (90.6%), france (89.9%) and italy (83.3%), whilst piperacillin/tazobactam showed the highest expected coverage in germany (93.1%) and imipenem in spain (87.7%). our results suggest that tigecycline represents a viable additional option for the empirical treatment of  csssi in these countries.

TI  == bacterial defluorination of 4-fluoroglutamic acid.
AB  == fluorinated amino acids are used as enzyme inhibitors, mechanistic probes and in  the production of pharmacologically active peptides. because enantiomerically pure 4-fluoroglutamate is difficult to prepare, the selective degradation of the  l-isomer is a potentially convenient method of obtaining d-4-fluoroglutamate from the racemate. in this paper, we describe our investigations on the degradation of 4-fluoroglutamate by bacteria. fluoride ion was detected in resting-cell cultures of a number of bacteria that were incubated with racemic 4-fluoroglutamate. analysis of the culture supernatants by chiral gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that only the l-isomer was degraded. the degradation of 4-fluoroglutamate was also examined in cell-free extracts of streptomyces cattleya and proteus mirabilis, and it was observed that equimolar concentrations of fluoride ion and ammonia were generated. the activity was located in the soluble fraction of cell extracts, thus is not related to the l-2-amino-4-chloro-4-pentenoic acid dehydrochlorinase previously identified in membrane fractions of p. mirabilis.

TI  == first report of the emergence of ctx-m-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) as the predominant esbl isolated in a u.s. health care system.
AB  == ctx-m-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) have become increasingly common worldwide, with the notable exception of the united states, where tem- and shv-type esbls have appeared to predominate. we have noted the emergence of esbls in our health care system (the university health system in san antonio, tx), especially in escherichia coli isolates, that preferentially hydrolyze cefotaxime rather than ceftazidime, suggesting the possibility of ctx-m-type enzymes. microbiology laboratory records were reviewed to identify esbl-producing isolates and to compare the diameters of ceftazidime disk diffusion zones of inhibition to cefotaxime zone diameters. all isolates had been initially detected and confirmed using the procedures recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. a total of 94 stored esbl-producing isolates recovered between january 2000 and june 2006 (predominately from blood and normally sterile fluids) were retrieved for further study and screened using pcr primers specific for the presence of ctx-m, tem, and shv esbls. only small numbers of retained esbl-producing isolates were available for study in 2000 and 2002. the percentages of available esbl-producing organisms in the following years were found to produce ctx-m enzymes: 2000, 25%; 2001, 10%; 2002, 0%; 2003, 60%; 2004,  69%; 2005, 89%; and 2006, 70%. the most common ctx-m-type esbl was ctx-m-15, followed by ctx-m-16, ctx-m-8, and ctx-m-14. comparing the disk diffusion zone diameters of cefotaxime and ceftazidime was helpful with the initial recognition  of ctx-m-producing e. coli, which had an average cefotaxime zone diameter 7 mm smaller than the ceftazidime zone. however, comparing ceftazidime and cefotaxime  zones for ctx-m-producing klebsiella spp. was not helpful with initial recognition. ctx-m enzymes were also identified in proteus mirabilis, enterobacter spp., and morganella morganii. based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing of the e. coli isolates, the ctx-m-producing isolates did  not represent the spread of a single clone in the institution or in the community. in conclusion, ctx-m-type esbls are now the most common esbl type isolated from patients in our health care system and may also be present but unrecognized in other u.s. locales.

TI  == diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  == the diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of eudrilus eugeniae, lampito mauritii, eisenia fetida and perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. while actinomycetes (streptomyces albus, s. somaliensis, nocardia asteroides, n. caviae and saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (amoeba proteus, a. terricola, paramecium trichium, euglena viridis, e.  orientalis, vorticella picta and trichomonas hominis) and yeast (candida tropicalis, c. krusei c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. certain species of fungi (saksenae vasiformis, mucor plumbeus, cladosporium carrionii, c. herbacium, alternaria sp., cunninghamella echinulata,  mycetia sterila, syncephalostrum racemosum, curvalaria lunata, c. geniculata and  geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterium antitratum,  mima polymorpha, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri, escherichia coli, staphylococus citreus, bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococci and micrococci) were completely digested. certain other species were not digested fungi like aspergillus fumigatus, a. flavus, a. ochraceous, trichoderma koningii (except by eeugeniae), fusarium moniliforme (except by e. eugeniae) and rhizopus sp., and bacteria like klebsiella pneumoniae and morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. the microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in  the casts.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the united states between 1993 and 2004.
AB  == during the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care  unit (icu) patients in united states hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. mics for 12 different agents were  determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. the 11 organisms most frequently isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), escherichia coli (18.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), serratia marcescens (5.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (4.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and citrobacter freundii (2.0%). specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. e. coli and p. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with acinetobacter spp. rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study  period for most species. ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (acinetobacter spp., c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens) became more susceptible. the prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among icu isolates of acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae.

TI  == aggregative adherence of uropathogenic proteus mirabilis to cultured epithelial cells.
AB  == proteus mirabilis is an important cause of urinary tract infection (uti) in patients with complicated urinary tracts. thirty-five strains of p. mirabilis isolated from uti were examined for the adherence capacity to epithelial cells. all isolates displayed the aggregative adherence (aa) to hep-2 cells, a phenotype similarly presented in llc-mk(2) cells. biofilm formation on polystyrene was also observed in all strains. the mannose-resistant proteus-like fimbriae (mr/p), type i fimbriae and aaf/i, ii and iii fimbriae of enteroaggregative escherichia coli were searched by the presence of their respective adhesin-encoding genes. only the mr/p fimbrial subunits encoding genes mrpa and mrph were detected in all isolates, as well as mr/p expression. a mutation in mrpa demonstrated that mr/p is involved in aggregative adherence to hep-2 cells, as well as in biofilm formation. however, these phenotypes are multifactorial, because the mrpa mutation reduced but did not abolish both phenotypes. the present results reinforce the importance of mr/p as a virulence factor in p. mirabilis due to its association with aa and biofilm formation, which is an important step for the establishment of uti in catheterized patients.

TI  == antibiotic resistance pattern in uropathogens.
AB  == uropathogenic strains from inpatient and outpatient departments were studied from april 1997 to march 1999 for their susceptibility profiles. the various isolates  were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumanii and enterococcus faecalis. antibiotic susceptibility pattern of these isolates revealed that for outpatients, first generation cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin were effective for treatment of urinary tract infection but for inpatients, parenteral therapy with newer aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins need to be advocated as the organisms for nosocomial uti exhibit a high degree of drug resistance. trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole combination was not found to be effective for the treatment of urinary tract infections as all the uropathogens from inpatients and outpatients showed high degree of resistance to co-trimoxazole. culture and sensitivity of the isolates from urine samples should be done as a routine before advocating the therapy.

TI  == investigation of essential oil extracts from four native jamaican species of bursera for antibacterial activity.
AB  == objective: bacterial infection with organisms resistant to antibiotics have increased during the last few decades worldwide. because of this increase, the authors decided to subject the essential oils from the stem, leaves and fruits of the four native jamaica species of bursera to microbial studies. methods: steam distillate extracts from different parts of four native jamaican spp of bursera simaruba (red birch), bursera lunanii (black birch), bursera hollickii and bursera aromatica (siboney) were tested for their antibacterial activity against  six common pathogens: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylocococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) and beta-haemolytic streptococcus group a (bhsa) using a disk diffusion assay. results: the investigation revealed that extracts from two of the four plants tested were active against all the pathogens. these were extracts from the fruits and stems of b. simaruba and those from the fruit of b. lunanii. conclusion: this study gives credence to the ongoing search for locally available plants whose extracts possess significant antimicrobial activity. this may be useful in the development of naturally derived pharmaceuticals.

TI  == antimicrobial activity against gram negative bacilli from yaounde central hospital, cameroon.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance among bacteria pathogens is a world-wide issue. the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of common pathogenic bacteria are essential to guide empirical and pathogen-specific therapy; unfortunately, these data are scarse in cameroon. objective: to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of gram-negative bacilli isolated in yaounde central hospital laboratory of bacteriology. methods: gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 505), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) in  yaounde central hospital laboratory of bacteriology between march 1995 and april  1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) by the kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. results: high rates of resistance were found in most of the bacteria studied. resistance to all isolates was mostly observed for amoxicillin (87%), piperacillin (74%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (73%). susceptibilities to third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) and monobactame (aztreonam) were = 91% for escherichia coli, = 71% for klebsiella spp., = 98% for proteus mirabilis, = 50% for enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. pseudomonas aeruginosa was less susceptible to cefotaxime (2%) and aztreonam (33%), and highly susceptible to ceftazidime (72%) whereas acinetobacter baumannii was highly resistant to aztreonam (100%), to cefotaxime (96%) and cetazidime (62%). imipenem (98%) was the most active antibiotic followed by the ofloxacine (88%). susceptibility of all isolates to gentamicin was 67%. conclusion: these results indicate that surveillance to antimicrobial resistance in cameroon is necessary to monitor microbial trends, antimicrobial resistance pattern, and provide information for choosing empirical or direct therapy to physicians.

TI  == convenient test using a combination of chelating agents for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in the clinical laboratory.
AB  == although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the clsi currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of mbls. the aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (ddts) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa) and tris-edta (te) to detect mbls. sixteen isolates (4 acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 serratia marcescens isolate, 1 aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing imp-1, imp-1-like, imp-18, gim-1, spm-1, vim-2, vim-2-like, and chromosomal mbls and 20 isolates (7 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 escherichia coli isolates, 5 enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 s. marcescens isolates, 1 proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 a. baumannii isolates) producing non-mbl carbapenemases, ampc beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. the ddt method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (te, high-strength te, mpa, and te plus 20 microl of mpa [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mem), ertapenem (ert), and ceftazidime (caz). ddts with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 1:320 mpa detected all mbls and yielded no false-positive  results. some, but not all, mbl producers were detected in ipm-based tests involving the single chelator te or mpa alone or by ert- or caz-based tests. ipm-based tests with mpa concentrations other than 1:320 and all mem-based tests  had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. ddt with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 mpa appears to be convenient for the detection of mbls in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of community-acquired urinary tract pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents in spain: a comparative multicenter study (2002-2004).
AB  == the susceptibility patterns of 2724 uropathogens isolated in 9 spanish regions during 2002, and 3013 obtained in 2004 were determined. the antibiotics tested were fosfomycin trometamol, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefixime, cefuroxime-axetil, pipemidic, ceprofloxacin, trimethoprim plus sulphamethoxazole  and nitrofurantoin. escherichia coli was the main pathogen in both studies (73% vs. 68.3%) followed by proteus mirabilis 7.2% vs. 6.4%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (5.4% vs. 5.2%). enteroccocus spp. (4.7% vs. 6.8%), streptoccocus agalactiae (1.7% vs. 3.1%) and staphyloccocus saprophyticus (0.7% vs. 1.3%)were the most frequent gram-positive pathogens. 31.3% of e. coli in 2002 and 32% in 2004 were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. around 40% of e. coli were resistant to a  single agent. 21.6-24.1% were resistant to two antibiotics. 35.4% of first period isolates, and 37.6% of second period ones were resistant to two or more classes of antibiotics. fosfomycin (2.1- 2.8%) and nitrofurantoin (3.5-5.7%) had the lowest resistance rates for e. coli. amoxicillin (58.2-58.7%), co-trimoxazole (30.8-33.8%) and ciprofloxacin (22.6-22.7%) showed the highest resistance rates,  and their suitability as empiric treatments for uti should probably be re-evaluated.

TI  == in vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of h2 receptor antagonists.
AB  == enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces  its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme dna gyrase. there are a number of drug  interactions reported for enoxacin. on the other hand h2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. as the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. in present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a b.p. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and h2-receptor antagonists alone. the interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. these studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (ph 9) and buffers of ph 7.4 simulating blood ph at 37 degrees c. in order to support these interaction studies, the effect of  h2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (mic) of enoxacin was also  studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against staphylococcus  aureus, streptococcus pyogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and bacillus subtilis. on the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with h2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in mic of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.

TI  == a comparative assessment of the antimicrobial effects of garlic (allium sativum)  and antibiotics on diarrheagenic organisms.
AB  == antimicrobial sensitivity tests were carried out on escherichia coli, shigella sp, salmonella sp, and proteus mirabilis using standard procedures. significant differences (p < 0.01) were seen in the effect of the antimicrobial agents (garlic, ciprofloxacin and ampicillin), and in the sensitivities of the microbial species (p < 0.01) to the antimicrobial agents were observed. the gram-negative diarrheagenic pathogens from the stool samples were highly sensitive to garlic, while ciprofloxacin (cpx) was most effective against e. coli. the differences were inferred to result from genetic differences among the organisms and differences in the modes of action of the antibiotics. no isolates were resistant to garlic, making it a promising antimicrobial agent. it appears that antibiotics that interfere with dna and rna syntheses, such as garlic does, could constitute  an effective partner in the synergic effect of garlic currently being investigated worldwide.

TI  == canine cathelicidin (k9cath): gene cloning, expression, and biochemical activity  of a novel pro-myeloid antimicrobial peptide.
AB  == cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection.  although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel  canine cathelicidin (k9cath). the full-length cdna sequence of k9cath encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature k9cath  peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. synthetic k9cath displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus; mics (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microm, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella serotype typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis; mics 1.25 microm, salmonella serotype  enteritidis; mic 0.5 microm, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; mic 0.06 microm), and yeast (candida albicans; mic 12.5-50 microm). k9cath demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against ureaplasma urealyticum (mic 0.06 and 50 microm, respectively). similar to its ovine congener smap-29, k9cath possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and lps binding capacity. k9cath displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. the potency and broad antimicrobial  activity of k9cath suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.

AB  == some new features of the in vitro activity of ceftibuten, an oral third generation cephalosporin, have been studied in reference to respiratory and urinary tract pathogens included in its antibacterial spectrum. at 0.25xmic (minimum inhibitory concentration) and 0.5xmic levels, ceftibuten was able to affect the biofilm production in 2/3 of both escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis strains, and reduced the number of strains capable of adhering to epithelial cells by about 35% in comparison to the control. surface hydrophobicity was also influenced by ceftibuten and the other drugs at 0.25-0.5xmic. in general, no marked variation in the virulence traits of the pathogens studied were found by exposing bacteria to sub-mics of ceftibuten. plasmid loss (from 1.8 to 37.2%), and flac transfer inhibition (about 30-50% reduction in the number of recombinants) were detected under the experimental conditions used. this study confirms the excellent antibacterial properties of ceftibuten by adding new information about the effects of this antibiotic against pathogens often involved in respiratory and urinary tract infections that may be  treated with this compound, supporting the appropriate use of this cephalosporin.

TI  == microbiologic profile of flexible endoscope disinfection in two brazilian hospitals.
AB  == background: [corrected] endoscopes are routinely used in hospitals and clinics of the world and they can be potential sources of cross-infection when the decontamination process is unsuitable aim: the routines of flexible endoscope (bronchoscopes, esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes) disinfection procedures used in two brazilian university hospitals were evaluated during a 3-year period methods: aleatory samples from internal channels of endoscopes were collected after patient examination and after cleaning/disinfection procedures results: a contamination >3 log10 was achieved in samples recovered from endoscopes after patient examination. these samples yielded gram-negative bacilli (n = 142: 56%), gram-positive cocci (n = 43: 17%), yeast cells (n = 43: 17%), and gram-positive bacilli (n = 26: 10%). approximately, 72 out of 149 samples (48.32%) collected after undergoing the cleaning and disinfection procedures disclosed gram-negative bacilli (n = 55: 61%), gram-positive cocci (n = 21: 23%), gram-positive bacilli (n = 8: 9%) and yeast cells (n = 6: 7%). esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes were the most frequently contaminated devices. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia  coli, enterobacter spp, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus coagulase negative, micrococcus luteus, candida albicans, c. tropicalis, c. glabrata, c. guilliermondii, bacillus spp and corynebacterium spp were predominantly identified conclusion: inappropriate cleaning and low times of disinfection were respectively the major  factors associated with the presence of microorganisms in colonoscopes and esophagogastroduodenoscopes. by analyzing the identified germs, hospital disinfection was considered of either intermediate or poor level. after this investigation, both university centers improved their previous protocols for disinfection and conditions for reprocessing endoscopes.

TI  == predictors of mortality in patients with bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: importance of inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment.
AB  == bloodstream infections (bsi) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing organisms markedly increase the rates of treatment failure and death. we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to identify risk factors for  mortality in adult in-patients with bsi caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae (esbl-bsi). particular attention was focused on defining the impact on the mortality of inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy (defined as the initiation of treatment with active antimicrobial agents >72 h after collection of the first positive blood culture). a total of 186 patients with esbl-bsi caused by escherichia coli (n = 104), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 58), or proteus mirabilis (n = 24) were identified by our microbiology laboratory from 1  january 1999 through 31 december 2004. the overall 21-day mortality rate was 38.2% (71 of 186). in multivariate analysis, significant predictors of mortality  were inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy (odds ratio [or] = 6.28; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 3.18 to 12.42; p < 0.001) and unidentified primary infection site (or = 2.69; 95% ci = 1.38 to 5.27; p = 0.004). the inadequately treated patients (89 of 186 [47.8%]) had a threefold increase in mortality compared to the adequately treated group (59.5% versus 18.5%; or = 2.38; 95% ci = 1.76 to 3.22; p < 0.001). the regimens most commonly classified as inadequate were based on oxyimino cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone therapy. prompt initiation of effective antimicrobial treatment is essential in patients with esbl-bsi, and empirical decisions must be based on a sound knowledge of the local distribution of pathogens and their susceptibility patterns.

TI  == potency and spectrum of garenoxacin tested against an international collection of skin and soft tissue infection pathogens: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1999-2004).
AB  == the spectrum and potency of garenoxacin, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone, against a large international collection (11723 strains) of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens that cause skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) were evaluated for the years 1999 to 2004. consecutive nonduplicate bacterial isolates were collected from patients with documented community-acquired or nosocomial ssti in >70 medical centers participating in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program in north america (37.4%), europe (26.7%), latin america (16.7%), and the asia-pacific region (19.2%). all isolates were tested using the  reference broth microdilution methods against garenoxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and representative comparator agents used for the empiric or directed therapy for ssti. ranking pathogens producing ssti during these years included staphylococcus aureus (42.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.1%), escherichia coli (9.0%), enterococcus spp. (7.3%), klebsiella spp. (4.8%), enterobacter spp. (4.7%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.5%), and acinetobacter spp. (2.1%). garenoxacin was the most potent agent tested against s. aureus and was at least 2-fold more active than gatifloxacin (mic(50), 0.06 mg/l) and 8-fold more active than levofloxacin (mic(50), 0.25 mg/l). furthermore, garenoxacin was 2- to 8-fold more potent than the fluoroquinolones against beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, as well as up to 4-fold more active against enterococci. garenoxacin was largely comparable with the comparator fluoroquinolones against e. coli, klebsiella spp., and acinetobacter spp., but it is less active than these agents against p. aeruginosa. in summary,  garenoxacin was documented to be the most potent quinolone when tested against key gram-positive pathogens (s. aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci) and was similar in activity to these agents  against other species (enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp.). these in vitro data suggest that garenoxacin warrants further clinical studies in ssti, especially against staphylococci and streptococcal pathogens.

TI  == [evaluation of vitek 2 performance for identifying extended spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae "other than escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp"].
AB  == production of beta-lactamases is the main resistance mechanism of gram-negative bacteria against beta-lactam antibiotics. extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) have the ability to hydrolyze a broader spectrum of beta-lactam drugs. hence rapid, accurate detection of this resistance mechanism is extremely important to guide proper patient antimicrobial therapy. these enzymes are most commonly produced by klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli, but may also occur widely in other gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter spp., proteus spp., morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens and others that also produce other chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes, like ampc beta-lactamases. the main problem is that no clsi (clinical and laboratory standards institute) recommendations exist for esbl detection for enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp and for detecting plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases. we carried out an evaluation of vitek 2 advanced expert system (aes) performance for identifying esbl in enterobacteriaceae, also other than e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp, comparing results obtained with etest and double disk data. seventy isolates of enterobacteriaceae were tested for the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) by using vitek 2, etest and the double disk method. the use of etest was performed as a gold standard method by comparing interpretation  results of vitek 2 advanced expert system (aes). in comparison with the etest method, aes produced 19 esbl warnings, of which only 5 were classified as major misunderstandings, especially for enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli, proteus  mirabilis and klebsiella spp which produced plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases. the etest, together with the cefoxitin sensibility test, was found to be the best method to confirm esbls and distinguish ampc from esbls.

TI  == an in vitro assessment of the antibacterial effect of garlic (allium sativum) on  bacterial isolates from wound infections.
AB  == background: garlic (allium sativum) has come to be seen as an all rounded treatment for preventing wound infection, common cold, malaria, cough and lung tuberculosis, hypertension, sexually transmitted diseases, mental illness, kidney diseases, liver diseases, asthma, diabetes. objective: the main objective of this study was to assess the antibacterial effect of crude preparation of garlic on bacterial isolates from the wound infections. methods: an experimental study was  conducted in gondar university teaching hospital school of medical laboratory technology, microbiology laboratory from june 2004 to april 2005 by agar dilution technique. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of garlic to control strains of staphylococcus aureus attc 25923 and escherichia coli attcc 25922, as well as to clinical isolates of s. aureus, e. coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using agar dilution method the data was collected in triplicate. results: all the tested organisms were inhibited by 33.75 mg/ml of the crude preparation of garlic except control organism and clinical isolates of  s. aureus, which were inhibited by 11.25 mg/ml of crude garlic. garlic did not reveal bactericidal effect up to a concentration of 37.5 mg/ml against all the tested organisms. conclusion: crude preparation of garlic could be used as an effective antibacterial agent for the tested organisms. nevertheless, clinical trial on the effect of garlic is essential before advocating large-scale therapy.

AB  == in vivo clinical trials involving the administration of crude extracts of cissus  populnea to male subjects (normospermic, oligospermic, and azoopermic) in a 72-day study revealed that continuous exposure of the subjects to the extracts over this period did not significantly (p < or = 0.05) alter sperm count, morphology, motility, or volume. antimicrobial screening of the extract against some selected microbial isolates secondarily implicated in male infertility revealed total inactivity against the microbial isolates screened, i.e., staphylococcus aureus, salmonella paratyphi, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, and klebsiella sp. phytochemistry revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, saponins, and steroids. the presence of these secondary metabolites was confirmed by thin layer chromatography. we conclude that oral administration of aqueous extracts of the stem bark of cisssus populnea over a 72-day period to human subjects apparently had no fertility enhancement effects on sperm parameters monitored in this study.

TI  == interspecies spread of ctx-m-32 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and the role of  the insertion sequence is1 in down-regulating bla ctx-m gene expression.
AB  == objectives: to characterize the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) as well as their genetic environment in different isolates of enterobacteriaceae from a patient with repeated urinary tract infections. methods: two isolates of escherichia coli and one proteus mirabilis, all with esbl phenotypes, were studied. conjugation experiments and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflps) were performed. cloning of the bla genes was by plasmid restriction and fragments ligation. antibiotic susceptibility testing was by etest. the genetic environment was analysed by direct sequencing of the dna surrounding the bla gene. rt-pcr was performed to study the differences in the bla(ctx-m) gene expression. results: the bla gene was transferred by conjugation from the three clinical isolates, which by rflp showed the same plasmid. the bla gene and surrounding sequences were cloned, an approximately 9 kbp acci fragment was sequenced and the bla(ctx-m-32) gene was identified. the mics of ceftazidime for  transconjugants and transformants bearing the bla(ctx-m-32) gene were lower than  those previously reported. analysis of the dna surrounding the esbl gene revealed a new genetic structure with two insertion sequences, is5 and is1, located immediately upstream of the bla(ctx-m-32) gene; is1 was located between the bla gene and is5, and within the -10 and -35 promoter boxes of the bla(ctx-m-32) gene. microbiological and biochemical studies revealed lower bla(ctx-m-32) gene expression in bacterial isolates with is1 between the promoter boxes. conclusions: data suggest putative in vivo horizontal bla(ctx-m-32) gene transfer between two different genera of enterobacteriaceae. a new complex structure, is5-is1, was detected upstream of the bla gene and is1 negatively modulated expression of the bla(ctx-m-32) gene because its location modified the bla promoter region.

TI  == epidemiology and bacterial colonization of burn injuries in blantyre.
AB  == forty-nine patients from the burns unit at the qech had swabs taken from various  sites in order to determine the bacterial profile and antibiotic susceptibilities in burn wounds colonized by bacteria. the mean age was 16 years (range 1-70 years); 27 (55 %) of the study population were female and 22 (45%) were male. twenty-four (49%) patients were epileptic. open fire (41%) was the most common cause of burn injuries among epileptics while hot water burns (29%) were commonest among non-epileptics. burn injury and percentage total burn surface area (% tbsa) injuries decreased with age, and the upper and lower limbs, trunk,  head and neck were the most commonly affected sites. staphylococcus aureus was the commonest isolate (23%), followed by proteus mirabilis (22.7%), streptococci  spp (15.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%) and 3.4% for escherichia coli, salmonella and klebsiella spp. there was a significant trend of bacterial growth  with increasing % tbsa (p<0.001). bacterial growth was significantly more common  in more recent burns of less than 20 days compared to burns of longer duration (or 4.1 [95% ci 1.58-10.99]). broad-spectrum antibiotics are required as first-line therapy for burns-related sepsis but there is need for surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility to help determine appropriate therapy.

TI  == the xaxab genes encoding a new apoptotic toxin from the insect pathogen xenorhabdus nematophila are present in plant and human pathogens.
AB  == xenorhabdus nematophila, a member of the enterobacteriaceae, kills many species of insects by strongly depressing the immune system and colonizing the entire body. a peptide cytotoxin has been purified from x. nematophila broth growth, and the cytolytic effect on insect immunocytes and hemolytic effect on mammalian red  blood cells of this toxin have been described (ribeiro, c., vignes, m., and brehelin, m. (2003) j. biol. chem. 278, 3030-3039). we show here that this toxin, xenorhabdus alpha-xenorhabdolysin (xax), triggers apoptosis in both insect and mammalian cells. we also report the cloning and sequencing of two genes, xaxab, encoding this toxin in x. nematophila. the expression of both genes in recombinant escherichia coli led to the production of active cytotoxin/hemolysin. however, hemolytic activity was observed only if the two peptides were added in the appropriate order. furthermore, we report here that inactivation of xaxab genes in x. nematophila abolished the major cytotoxic activity present in broth growth, called c1. we also show that these genes are present in various entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera xenorhabdus and photorhabdus, in pseudomonas entomophila, in the human pathogens yersinia enterocolitica and proteus mirabilis, and in the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae. this toxin cannot be classified in any known family of cytotoxins on the basis of amino acid sequences, locus organization, and activity features. it is, therefore, probably  the prototype of a new family of binary toxins.

AB  == objectives: to identify an appropriate sampling technique(s) to accurately detect the bacteria causing urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis. methods: twenty-one dogs with urolithiasis were included in the study. three types of samples were taken from each dog. urine was collected by cystocentesis, and a urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith were retrieved during cystotomy. the samples were then cultured on blood agar and macconkey's agar to identify the bacteria associated with urinary tract infections. results: bacterial urinary tract infection was found in 16 cases (76.19 per cent). the most prevalent bacteria found to cause urinary tract infection were escherichia coli (n=7), followed by coagulase-positive staphylococcus species (n=4), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=2) and proteus mirabilis (n=1). in the case of a positive urine culture, the same bacteria were also cultured from the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy alone or from both the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith. however, in the case of a negative urine culture, bacteria were found to be present in the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy or urolith cultures in 23.81 per cent of dogs. the uroliths that gave positive culture results were either infection-induced uroliths composed of struvite and calcium carbonate phosphate, ammonium acid urate only or metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, or calcium phosphate only. all the uroliths that gave negative culture results were metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate, and uric acid and calcium phosphate. clinical significance: when the culture from the urine obtained by cystocentesis  is negative, cultures of urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith are recommended in dogs with urolithiasis in order to accurately assess the microbiological status of the urinary tract.

TI  == accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a prospective study is carried out to evaluate the performance of a protocol for  the accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria. a modified double-disc test (mddt) is incorporated in a gram-negative template for routine susceptibility testing. the mddt identified accurately esbls in all isolates subsequently confirmed as esbl-producers by the  standard clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) combined disc method. of  1213 isolates tested, 98 (8%) were positive for esbls by mddt and 95 (7.8%) were  positive by the clsi method. esbls were detected in 48 (7.8%) e. coli, 21 (8%) k. pneumoniae, 12 (5.8%) proteus mirabilis, 13 (18.8%) providencia stuartii and four (6.8%) enterobacter cloacae isolates. time required for esbl detection by the mddt method was one day. the protocol described provides a simple, rapid and low-cost method for early detection of esbls in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activities of anthocephalus cadamba.
AB  == anthocephalus cadamba (roxb.) miq. syn a. chinensis (lamk) a. rich (rubiaceae) is ethnomedicinally widely used in the form of paste by tribe in western ghats for treating skin diseases. in this context, antimicrobial potential of a. cadamba against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. to validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing. the alchoholic and aqueous extract of this plant showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four fungi  candida albicans, trichophyton rubrum--dermatophyte fungi, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus and aspergillus nidulans--systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus) with an  mic of 2.5 microg/disc. the results show that a. cadamba extract has potent wound healing capacity as shown from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. the results also indicated that a. cadamba extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase activity.

TI  == comparison of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic indices of efficacy for 5 fluoroquinolones toward pathogens of dogs and cats.
AB  == background: fluoroquinolones are often used interchangeably in dogs and cats. hypothesis: predicted therapeutic efficacy differs among fluoroquinolones. animals: bacterial pathogens isolated from dogs and cats. methods: using microtube-dilution procedures, percent resistance and 2 pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic indices (maximum concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration [cmax/mic] [target 0.10] and area under curve/minimum inhibitory concentration [auc/mic] [target 0.125]) were compared prospectively at low and high doses (mg/kg) for ciprofloxacin (5 and 20), difloxacin (5 and 10), enrofloxacin (including enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin) (5 and 20), marbofloxacin (2.5 and 5), and orbifloxacin (2.5 and 7.5). indices were calculated for organisms represented by < or = 15 isolates. results: percent resistance for all  gram-negative (n = 180; 20+/-3%; 39+/-5% for escherichia coli) and gram-positive  isolates (n = 66; 18+/-3%) did not differ among drugs or organisms. the pattern of cmax/mic was generally enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin > or = enrofloxacin or ciprofloxacin > or = marbofloxacin > or = orbifloxacin > or = difloxacin; and for auic/ mic, enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin > or = marbofloxacin > or = ciprofloxacin > or = enrofloxacin > difloxacin > orbifloxacin. among susceptible gram-negative isolates studied (n = 117), targeted cmax/mic or auc/mic were achieved in 88% of  e. coli, 53% of proteus mirabilis, and 35% of pseudomonas aeruginosa; and for susceptible gram-positive isolates studied (n = 49), 53% of streptotoccus spp. and staphylococcus intermedius and 27% of staphylococcus spp. at the high dose, the proportion of isolates for which a target was reached was: ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin+ciprofloaxin, and marbofloxacin (77%), enrofloxacin (73%), orbifloxacin (51%), and difloxacin (40%); and at the low dose, enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin (43%), ciprofloxacin (40%), marbofloxacin (39%), orbifloxacin (29%), and difloxacin (28%). conclusions: e. coli resistance to fluoroquinolones approximated 40%. for susceptible isolates, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin more consistently reached indices  associated with predicted efficacy, but only at the high dose.

TI  == increased resistance to first-line agents among bacterial pathogens isolated from urinary tract infections in latin america: time for local guidelines?
AB  == emerging resistance phenotypes and antimicrobial resistance rates among pathogens recovered from community-acquired urinary tract infections (ca-uti) is an increasing problem in specific regions, limiting therapeutic options. as part of  the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, a total of 611 isolates were collected in 2003 from patients with ca-uti presenting at latin american medical  centers. each strain was tested in a central laboratory using clinical laboratory standard institute (clsi) broth microdilution methods with appropriate controls.  escherichia coli was the leading pathogen (66%), followed by klebsiella spp. (7%), proteus mirabilis (6.4%), enterococcus spp. (5.6%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.6%). surprisingly high resistance rates were recorded for e. coli against first-line orally administered agents for ca-uti, such as ampicillin (53.6%), tmp/smx (40.4%), ciprofloxacin (21.6%), and gatifloxacin (17.1%). decreased susceptibility rates to tmp/smx and ciprofloxacin were also documented  for klebsiella spp. (79.1 and 81.4%, respectively), and p. mirabilis (71.8 and 84.6%, respectively). for enterococcus spp., susceptibility rates to ampicillin,  chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin were 88.2, 85.3, 55.9, and 97.1%,  respectively. high-level resistance to gentamicin was detected in 24% of enterococcus spp. bacteria isolated from patients with ca-uti in latin america showed limited susceptibility to orally administered antimicrobials, especially for tmp/smx and fluoroquinolones. our results highlight the need for developing specific ca-uti guidelines in geographic regions where elevated resistance to new and old compounds may influence prescribing decisions.

TI  == in-vitro activity of triclosan-eluting ureteral stents against common bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == background and purpose: ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. materials and methods: triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli c1214, proteus mirabilis 296, enterococcus faecalis 1131, klebsiella pneumoniae 280, staphylococcus aureus newman, pseudomonas aeruginosa ak1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. generic stents were utilized as controls. results: triclosan inhibited the growth of e. faecalis, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and p. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated e. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein x and p-fimbriae. triclosan  stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. conclusions: triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. this drug-eluting stent provides both  mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens that cause community-acquired urinary tract infections in antananarivo, madagascar.
AB  == background: urinary tract pathogens obtained from patients in madagascar are becoming increasingly resistant to commonly used antibiotics that are readily available at a low price. this poses a real problem for the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections (utis) in madagascar. objectives: to  obtain data on the pathogens responsible for community-acquired utis in antananarivo and on their susceptibility patterns to the antimicrobial agents that are currently used to treat utis. methods: we conducted a retrospective study on bacteria isolated from the urine of patients at the institut pasteur of  madagascar between january 2004 and april 2006. results: we isolated 903 pathogens from 673 women and 213 men. the most commonly isolated bacteria were escherichia coli (607 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (87 strains), staphylococcus aureus (35 strains) and proteus mirabilis (32 strains). seventy-seven per cent of gram-negative bacilli were resistant to amoxicillin, 65.7% were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and more than 15% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. strains were rarely resistant to more expensive antibiotics (ceftriaxone 5.9%, fosfomycin 4.6%). most bacteria showed intermediate susceptibility to nitroxolin. resistance rates of e. coli to ceftriaxone and gentamicin increased significantly between 2005 and 2006, due to  the increase in strains harbouring an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. gram-positive bacteria, streptococcaceae and staphylococcus spp. were rarely resistant, but 9.5% of streptococci were resistant to penicillin a and 8% of staphylococci were resistant to oxacillin. conclusions: the rate of amoxicillin-  and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant enterobacteriaceae implies that another antibiotic should be used for empirical treatment and that there is a need for new generic drugs in developing countries, especially in madagascar.

TI  == a microbial diagnostic microarray technique for the sensitive detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria in a background of nonpathogens.
AB  == a major challenge in microbial diagnostics is the parallel detection and identification of low-bundance pathogens within a complex microbial community. in addition, a high specificity providing robust, reliable identification at least at the species level is required. a microbial diagnostic microarray approach, using single nucleotide extension labeling with gyrb as the marker gene, was developed. we present a novel concept applying competitive oligonucleotide probes to improve the specificity of the assay. our approach enabled the sensitive and specific detection of a broad range of pathogenic bacteria. the approach was tested with a set of 35 oligonucleotide probes targeting escherichia coli, shigella spp., salmonella spp., aeromonas hydrophila, vibrio cholerae, mycobacterium avium, mycobacterium tuberculosis, helicobacter pylori, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni. the introduction of competitive oligonucleotides in the labeling reaction successfully suppressed cross-reaction by closely related sequences, significantly improving the performance of the assay. environmental applicability was tested with environmental and veterinary samples harboring complex microbial communities. detection sensitivity in the range of 0.1% has been demonstrated, far below the 5% detection limit of traditional microbial diagnostic microarrays.

TI  == are laboratory-based antibiograms reliable to guide the selection of empirical antimicrobial treatment in patients with hospital-acquired infections?
AB  == objectives: antibiograms are often taken into account to define a rational selection of an empirical antimicrobial therapy for treating patients with hospital-acquired infections. in this study, we performed a paired comparison between the antibiogram constructed with laboratory-based data and that formed with data subjected to prior clinical validation. methods: between 2003 and 2005, the laboratory of microbiology printed in duplicate every individual susceptibility report corresponding to hospitalized patients and the copy was sent to the department of infection control. every individual report was assessed in real time at the bedside of the patient by a multidisciplinary team for clinical significance and appropriateness of the specimen, as well as for the type, source and origin of the infection. cumulative resistance rates were estimated in parallel at the laboratory with the whole data, and at the infection control department with data subjected to prior clinical validation. these rates  were designated as 'laboratory-based' and 'clinically based', respectively. results: a total of 2305 individual susceptibility reports were assessed. only 1429 (62.0%) were considered as clinically significant by the multidisciplinary team. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii group, klebsiella species and proteus mirabilis resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, as well as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, were significantly more frequent in the clinically based rates (p < or = 0.03). conclusions: laboratory-based data underestimate the frequency of several major resistant organisms in patients with hospital-acquired infection. previous clinical validation of the individual susceptibility reports seems to be a suitable strategy to get more reliable data.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == there is a low incidence of recurrent bacteriuria in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis patients followed longitudinally.
AB  == the objective of this paper was to establish whether patients with confirmed painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (pbs/ic) presenting with symptoms  of uti have actual bacteriuria vs a flare of their pbs/ic symptoms. one hundred and six (n = 106) consecutive female patients (mean age 39.8 +/- 14 years) with newly diagnosed ic were identified and followed longitudinally for 24 months. at  the initial visit and at all subsequent visits, urinary specimens were obtained by sterile catheterization (bard 14fr female) and cultured for bacteria. eight patients had an initially positive urine culture, and repeat cultures 8 weeks after treatment were all negative. once sterile urine was established, the diagnosis of pbs/ic was confirmed. a pelvic pain/urgency/frequency (puf) questionnaire score was obtained from 89 patients. after the diagnosis of pbs/ic, all patients received multimodal treatment. patients were instructed to present to the office whenever they developed symptoms of uti, at which time a sterile catheter specimen was obtained and sent for culture. greater than 10(3) colonies  were considered positive. patients who did not report flares were contacted to establish whether unreported treatments were given. seventy-two patients (68%) had no uti episodes or flares. the remaining 34 patients (32%) presented with 54  flares, of which 44 were culture-negative and 10 were culture-positive. a single  flare was reported by 21 patients during the 24 months, with three positive cultures (14.3%). recurrent uti symptoms (two to four flares) were seen in a small group (n = 13) for a total of 33 flares. of these, seven had two flares each (12 negative, 2 positive), five had three flares each (12 negative, 3 positive), and one patient had four flares (two negative, two positive). therefore, within the group with recurrent symptoms, seven positive cultures were obtained for a rate of recurrent bacteriuria of 6.6% (7/106). nine of the 10 positive bacterial cultures were due to gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli  (n = 6), proteus mirabilis (n = 1), klebsiella pneumonia (n = 1), and citrobacter sp. (n = 1). one grew streptococcus sp. there was no difference between the flare group and nonflares in regards to age or puf scores between groups. this study is the first to report on the low incidence of confirmed utis in a large group of pbs/ic patients followed longitudinally. these data suggest that only a small number of pbs/ic patients with uti symptoms have positive urine cultures (9.4%; 10/106). although the symptoms of recurrent uti are prevalent in ic patients, the incidence of confirmed recurrent utis is only 6.6%. because the flares of ic are  usually self-limiting, treatment response to antibiotics may be misleading in light of the low incidence of positive urine cultures. these data suggest that the symptom flares of ic are not usually associated with recurrent uti and, therefore, are likely due to a triggering of the other painful mechanisms involved in ic patients who are culture-negative.

TI  == effective prevention of microbial biofilm formation on medical devices by low-energy surface acoustic waves.
AB  == low-energy surface acoustic waves generated from electrically activated piezo elements are shown to effectively prevent microbial biofilm formation on indwelling medical devices. the development of biofilms by four different bacteria and candida species is prevented when such elastic waves with amplitudes in the nanometer range are applied. acoustic-wave-activated foley catheters have  all their surfaces vibrating with longitudinal and transversal dispersion vectors homogeneously surrounding the catheter surfaces. the acoustic waves at the surface are repulsive to bacteria and interfere with the docking and attachment of planktonic microorganisms to solid surfaces that constitute the initial phases of microbial biofilm development. fimh-mediated adhesion of uropathogenic escherichia coli to guinea pig erythrocytes was prevented at power densities below thresholds that activate bacterial force sensor mechanisms. elevated power  densities dramatically enhanced red blood cell aggregation. we inserted foley urinary catheters attached with elastic-wave-generating actuators into the urinary tracts of male rabbits. the treatment with the elastic acoustic waves maintained urine sterility for up to 9 days compared to 2 days in control catheterized animals. scanning electron microscopy and bioburden analyses revealed diminished biofilm development on these catheters. the ability to prevent biofilm formation on indwelling devices and catheters can benefit the implanted medical device industry.

TI  == assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program on 3 continents.
AB  == selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use  in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. the purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3  continents using data from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. a total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. with a  protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or  =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. broth microdilution methods and current clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint criteria were used. the 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in north america (27.4%) and europe (19.0%), but escherichia coli was most common in latin america (19.3%). all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from north america and latin america were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. however, 2 s. pneumoniae strains from italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/ml). ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci  were clonal. numerous strains of klebsiella spp. (22.5%), e. coli (4.5%), and proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from latin america and 1 from europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 p. aeruginosa isolates from turkey were resistant to polymyxin b (> or =4 microg/ml), and 8.7% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from latin america were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because  new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age  group.

AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in taiwan: epidemiology, detection, treatment and infection control.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) efficiently hydrolyze extended-spectrum beta-lactams such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. esbls are most often plasmid-mediated. in taiwan, the prevalence of esbls in bacteria has risen, ranging from 8.5 to 29.8% in klebsiella pneumoniae and 1.5 to 16.7% in escherichia coli isolates. the most prevalent types of esbls are shv-5, shv-12, ctx-m-3, and ctx-m-14 in isolates of k. pneumoniae and e. coli, with differences  between institutions. shv-12 and ctx-m-3 have been reported as the most common esbls in isolates of enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively.  molecular epidemiology studies suggest that the esbl-encoding genes have been disseminated either by proliferation of epidemic strains or by transfer of plasmids carrying the resistance traits. the current esbl screen guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly national committee for  clinical laboratory standards) are issued for e. coli, klebsiella spp., and proteus mirabilis. owing to the lack of standard methods, it remains difficult to assure the presence of esbl in an isolate co-harboring an ampc beta-lactamase, particularly in cases where the latter is produced in larger amounts than the former. empirical therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam to replace third-generation cephalosporins may help to reduce the occurrence of esbls in an  institution with a high prevalence of esbl producers. carbapenems remain the drugs of choice for serious infections caused by esbl-producing organisms. to retard the selection for carbapenem-resistant bacteria, 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactams or fourth-generation cephalosporins can be therapeutic alternatives  for mild-to-moderate infections provided that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic target can be easily achieved.

AB  == fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar (febla), a new differential medium for enteric bacteria was developed and evaluated for its ability to grow and differentiate lactose fermenters (lf) from non-lactose fermenters (nlf) in comparison with macconkeys agar. performance of febla was at par with the latter. on febla medium, the contrast between lf and nlf colonies was pronounced and klebsiella pneumoniae produced more mucoid colonies than on macconkeys agar (hi media). unlike macconkeys agar, a 24 h culture of k. pneumoniae cells on febla were longer and thicker with abundant capsular material around the bacilli. escherichia coli produced long and thick cells but only after 48h. no change in cell morphology was evident with regard to salmonella typhi, s. paratyphi a, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter koseri and acinetobacter baumannii. performance of the medium was controlled using e. coli and s. flexneri. febla is simple, cost effective and may be a suitable alternative in the preliminary identification of enteric bacteria.

TI  == [epidemiology and etiology of urinary tract infections in the community. antimicrobial susceptibility of the main pathogens and clinical significance of resistance].
AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) are a frequent problem in primary care. they occur mainly in women without underlying diseases and with no functional or structural  anomalies of the urinary tract; consequently most cases are considered uncomplicated uti. etiology is influenced by factors such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, urinary catheterization, and other factors. escherichia coli  causes 80-85% of acute episodes of uncomplicated cystitis. staphylococcus saprophyticus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus agalactiae and klebsiella spp. are responsible for most of the remaining episodes. the spectrum of bacteria that causes complicated uti is much broader. rates of resistance have undergone considerable variations, and consequently the empirical treatment of uti requires constant updating of the antibiotic sensitivity of the main uropathogens of the area, country or institution. to correctly interpret the global data on sensitivity, the type of uti (uncomplicated versus complicated), sex, age and previous antibiotic therapy in each patient must be taken into account. resistance in uncomplicated uti has clinical significance (although less than in  systemic infections such as bacteremia), which depends on whether the infection is cystitis or pyelonephritis.

TI  == urinary tract infection caused by fluoroquinolone- and cephem-resistant enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == in 2001, fluoroquinolone-resistant escherichia coli isolates emerged in japan in  patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uti), and accounted for ca.  8% of isolates. this is a worldwide occurrence as reported by the eco.sens study. the number of fluoroquinolone- and cephem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients with complicated uti is increasing. most cephem-resistant isolates  of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). the rates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae differ between countries but there are esbl producers in urinary enterobacteriaceae isolates in most countries. more seriously, most nosocomial esbl producers are also resistant to non-beta-lactams, such as the fluoroquinolones, fosfomycin and  co-trimoxazole. this causes serious problems in the chemotherapy of cystitis.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uti) are treated with beta-lactams, co-trimoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin tromethamine. due to increasing resistance of causative pathogens, antibiotics should be used by considering their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics. beta-lactams have time-dependent activity and should not be used once-daily. co-trimoxazole should  be restricted due to increasing chemoresistance. fluoroquinolones play a primary  role in the treatment of serious and complicated infections. fosfomycin tromethamine is active against most urinary tract pathogens. in vitro time-kill kinetics of fosfomycin against escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis showed primarily concentration-dependent activity, with a prolonged post-antibiotic effect (3.4 to 4.7h). based on these results a single 3g dose of fosfomycin guarantees optimal efficacy against common uropathogens with an auc(urine)/mic ratio of 500.

TI  == in vitro activities of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against bacterial pathogens isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: smart 2004 programme data.
AB  == we investigated the in vitro activity of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against gram-negative bacterial isolates from intensive care units (icus) in taiwan. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 1030 bacterial isolates recovered from icus of nine major teaching hospitals was performed using the agar dilution method. sulbactam was added to piperacillin either at a fixed sulbactam  concentration of 4 mg/l and 8 mg/l or at a piperacillin:sulbactam ratio of 2:1 and 4:1. piperacillin/sulbactam at a ratio of 2:1 or a fixed 8 mg/l concentration of sulbactam had better activities against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens than other piperacillin/sulbactam formulations. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin/sulbactam (2:1 or 4:1 ratios) had mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) of 64 mg/l (>90% susceptibility) compared with 64 mg/l for cefoperazone/sulbactam (68% susceptibility) and 128 mg/l for piperacillin/tazobactam (82% susceptibility). for acinetobacter baumannii, both piperacillin/sulbactam (either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/l sulbactam) and cefoperazone/sulbactam were the most potent agents. adding sulbactam to piperacillin resulted in increased susceptibility rates among piperacillin-resistant p. aeruginosa (53-57% in either 2:1 or 4:1 ratios) and a.  baumannii (38-46% in either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/l concentration of sulbactam) isolates. results of susceptibility tests with piperacillin/sulbactam  are dependent on the method used. piperacillin/sulbactam combinations possessed better in vitro activities than piperacillin alone or piperacillin/tazobactam against p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii.

TI  == a simple phenotypic method for differentiation between acquired and chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases in escherichia coli.
AB  == background: screening methods for the detection of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases are technically demanding. the purpose of this study was to assess screening methods for the detection of these enzymes in clinical isolates  of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. methods: isolates were selected according to a resistance phenotype consistent with production of an ampc-type beta-lactamase. detection of acquired ampc genes was done with a multiplex ampc-pcr and sequencing. the phenotypic detection methods evaluated included visual examination of antibiogram plates to identify the presence of scattered colonies located near the edge of the inhibition halo of cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam, and a double-disc synergy test  using cloxacillin (500 mg) to inhibit ampc enzymes. results: seventy-seven isolates were selected from among 6,209 isolates recovered. acquired ampc genes (blacmy-2, bladha-1, blacmy-4 and blaacc-1) were found in 19 (24.7%) of these isolates, including 14 e. coli, two k. pneumoniae and three p. mirabilis isolates. the differential trait for the presence of colonies in the inhibition halo was 100% sensitive and specific. similar results were obtained for the cloxacillin test, except for the e. coli isolates in which specificity was 10.3%. conclusion: the phenotypic trait described here can be considered useful for suspecting the presence of these enzymes. the cloxacillin test was only useful in isolates lacking a natural ampc beta-lactamase.

AB  == the use of fluoroquinolones has been linked to increasing bacterial resistance and infection and/or colonization with already resistant pathogens both as a risk factor and based on volume of use. changes in individual fluoroquinolones used in an institution may also be related to these clinical problems. interrupted time series analysis, which allows for assessment of the associations of an outcome attributable to a specific event in time, was used to study the effect of changes in our hospital's fluoroquinolone formulary on fluoroquinolone susceptibility rates in select gram-negative pathogens and the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) isolation rate. susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were considered for the period of 1993 through 2004, while the mrsa isolation rate was assessed from 1995 through 2004. levofloxacin was added to the formulary in 1999, and gatifloxacin was substituted for levofloxacin in 2001. statistically significant changes in the already declining rates of susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa (p, 0.042) and escherichia coli (p, 0.004) to ciprofloxacin and in the already rising mrsa isolation rate (p, 0.001)  were associated with the addition of levofloxacin to the formulary. substitution  of gatifloxacin for levofloxacin on the formulary was associated with reversals in the downward trend in e. coli susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and the upward trend in mrsa isolation rate. no associations were detected on susceptibility of  klebsiella pneumoniae or proteus mirabilis to ciprofloxacin. these findings suggest that potential changes in susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and isolation of mrsa may vary by both drug and organism.

AB  == we evaluated the ability of 60 italian clinical microbiology laboratories in detecting and reporting beta-lactam resistance phenotypes in enterobacteriaceae.  laboratories received 5 well-characterized isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), 2 hyperproducers of chromosomal enzymes, and 3 quality control strains. the performances in antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) were different depending on the species and type of esbl produced. high rates of  very major errors (up to 56%) were observed for esbl producers when testing cephalosporins and aztreonam, especially in the case of ctx-m-1-producing escherichia coli and tem-52-producing proteus mirabilis. isolates hyperproducing  chromosomal enzymes were erroneously reported as esbl producers in approximately  20% of cases. detection of esbls is still a problem for clinical microbiology laboratories. overall, performances in ast appear to be better with klebsiella spp. producing well-known enzymes (e.g., shv type) than with strains producing emerging enzymes (e.g., ctx-m type) or organisms not well recognized as esbl producers (e.g., p. mirabilis).

TI  == lipid-specific membrane activity of human beta-defensin-3.
AB  == defensins represent a major component of innate host defense against bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses. one potent defensin found, e.g., in epithelia, is the polycationic human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3). we investigated the role of the lipid matrix composition, and in particular the presence of negatively charged lipopolysaccharides (lps) from sensitive (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar minnesota) or resistant (proteus mirabilis) gram-negative bacteria or of  the zwitterionic phospholipids of human cells, in determining the action of polycationic hbd3 on the different membranes, and related to their biological activity. the main focus was directed on data derived from electrical measurements on a reconstitution system of the om as a planar asymmetric bilayer  composed on one side of lps and on the other of a phospholipid mixture. our results demonstrate that the antimicrobial activity and the absence of cytotoxicity can be explained by the lipid-specificity of the peptide. a clear correlation between these aspects of the biological activity of hbd3 and its interaction with lipid matrices could be found. in particular, hbd3 could only induce lesions in those membranes resembling the lipid composition of the om of sensitive bacterial strains. the permeation through the membrane is a decisive first step for the biological activity of many antimicrobial peptides. therefore, we propose that the lipid-specificity of hbd3 as well as some other membrane-active antimicrobial peptides is important for their activity against bacteria or mammalian cells.

TI  == cold adapted features of vibrio salmonicida catalase: characterisation and comparison to the mesophilic counterpart from proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the gene encoding catalase from the psychrophilic marine bacterium vibrio salmonicida lfi1238 was identified, cloned and expressed in the catalase-deficient escherichia coli um2. recombinant catalase from v. salmonicida (vsc) was purified to apparent homogeneity as a tetramer with a molecular mass of 235 kda. vsc contained 67% heme b and 25% protoporphyrin ix. vsc was able to bind nadph, react with cyanide and form compounds i and ii as other monofunctional small subunit heme catalases. amino acid sequence alignment of vsc and catalase from the mesophilic proteus mirabilis (pmc) revealed 71% identity. as for cold adapted enzymes in general, vsc possessed a lower temperature optimum and higher  catalytic efficiency (k (cat)/k (m)) compared to pmc. vsc have higher affinity for hydrogen peroxide (apparent k (m)) at all temperatures. for vsc the turnover  rate (k (cat)) is slightly lower while the catalytic efficiency is slightly higher compared to pmc over the temperature range measured, except at 4 degrees c. moreover, the catalytic efficiency of vsc and pmc is almost temperature independent, except at 4 degrees c where pmc has a twofold lower efficiency compared to vsc. this may indicate that vsc has evolved to maintain a high efficiency at low temperatures.

TI  == urinary tract infections in general practice patients: diagnostic tests versus bacteriological culture.
AB  == objectives: urinary tract infections (utis) are common bacterial infections encountered in general practice. for the optimal treatment the general practitioner (gp) should rely on the results of diagnostic tests and recent antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. patients and methods: in total 1993 female patients (11-70 years) with complaints of an acute uncomplicated uti were  included. the performance characteristics of the diagnostic tests used were determined and compared with the antibiotic prescription rate. the antibiotic therapy (agent and duration), the uropathogens and the antibiotic susceptibility  of escherichia coli were determined for each age group. results: the positive predictive value (ppv) (96%) and the specificity (94%) of the nitrite test were high for all samples. a negative nitrite with a positive leucocyte-esterase (le)  test showed a high ppv (79%) and sensitivity (82%). when both nitrite and le tests were negative approximately 50% of the samples were culture positive. of the patients, 94% of those with a positive nitrite test and 71% of those with a negative nitrite and positive le test were prescribed antibiotics, mostly nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim. nitrofurantoin prescriptions decreased and those of fluoroquinolones increased with increasing age. nitrofurantoin was equally prescribed for 3-7 days in all patients. trimethoprim was mostly prescribed for 3 days in patients aged 21-50 years and for 5 days in the other patients. e. coli,  the uropathogen mostly isolated, decreased in frequency with increasing age. proteus mirabilis was found more in the oldest patients and staphylococcus saprophyticus in the younger patients. the antimicrobial susceptibility of e. coli was not age related. the lowest percentages were found for amoxicillin (67%) and trimethoprim (77%). fluoroquinolone resistance was emerging in the older patients. conclusions: for female patients with symptoms of an acute uncomplicated uti a positive nitrite test or a negative nitrite test with a positive le test confirmed uti whereas a negative nitrite together with a negative le test did not rule out infection. for empirical treatment gps should take into account the changing aetiology with increasing age. prudent use of antibiotics in general and more specifically fluoroquinolones remains recommended. as trimethoprim resistance reached 20% it might be advisable to no longer use it as therapy of first choice for acute uncomplicated utis in the netherlands.

TI  == crystallization of truncated hemolysin a from proteus mirabilis.
AB  == proteus species are second only to escherichia coli as the most common causative  agent of gram-negative bacteria-based urinary-tract infections and many harbor several virulence factors that provide inherent uropathogenicity. one virulence factor stems from a two-partner secretion pathway comprised of hemolysin a and hemolysin b; upon hemolysin b-dependent secretion, hemolysin a becomes activated. this system is distinct from the classic type i secretion pathway exemplified by  the hemolysin system within escherichia coli. in order to describe the mechanism  by which hemolysin a is activated for pore formation, an amino-terminal truncated form capable of complementing the non-secreted full-length hemolysin a and thereby restoring hemolytic activity has been constructed, expressed and purified. a room-temperature data set has been collected to 2.5 a resolution. the crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group p2(1)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = 34.47, b = 58.40, c = 119.74 a. the asymmetric unit is expected to contain a single monomer, which equates to a matthews coefficient of 1.72 a3 da(-1) and a solvent content of 28.3%.

TI  == clonal occurrences of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli: report from the  meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection surveillance program  in the united states (2004).
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection program is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum agents. between 1999 and 2004, a total of 10-16 us medical centers referred up to 200 nonduplicate isolates from clinical infections to a central processing laboratory. over this 6-year period, the antimicrobial activity of 12 broad-spectrum agents was assessed against 15990 bacterial isolates using clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) reference methods. analysis of the mic results by year within organism species and/or organism groups revealed a continued decrease in fluoroquinolone susceptibility (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), especially among indole-positive proteae (-22.1%), escherichia coli (-17.0%), enterobacter species (-10.0%), and proteus mirabilis (-7.6%) isolates. antibiogram analysis of strains demonstrating multidrug resistance from the same institutions were further characterized by automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine clonality. in 2004, a total of 165 selected multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains produced 64 different ribotypes with the largest representing 31 escherichia coli isolates from 6 medical centers. other clusters were also identified within single medical centers among enterobacter cloacae (6 strains), providencia stuartii (5 strains), and morganella morganii (4 strains). a significant clonal outbreak encompassing 40 acinetobacter baumannii isolates from 3 centers in a single endemic region was identified in 1999 and has persisted through 2004. continued surveillance of these broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against mdr pathogens appears warranted to monitor the incidence and spread of resistant clones causing serious infections. possible emergence of resistance mechanisms via clonal dissemination  proves to be among the principle threats that compromise carbapenem therapy, where meropenem maintains the broadest spectrum of coverage.

TI  == use of electrochemical dna biosensors for rapid molecular identification of uropathogens in clinical urine specimens.
AB  == we describe the first species-specific detection of bacterial pathogens in human  clinical fluid samples using a microfabricated electrochemical sensor array. each of the 16 sensors in the array consisted of three single-layer gold electrodes-working, reference, and auxiliary. each of the working electrodes contained one representative from a library of capture probes, each specific for  a clinically relevant bacterial urinary pathogen. the library included probes for escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterocococcus spp., and the klebsiella-enterobacter group. a bacterial 16s rrna target derived from single-step bacterial lysis was hybridized both to the biotin-modified capture probe on the sensor surface and to a second, fluorescein-modified detector probe. detection of the target-probe hybrids was achieved through binding of a horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody to the detector probe. amperometric measurement of the catalyzed hrp reaction was obtained at a fixed potential of -200 mv between the working and reference electrodes. species-specific detection of as few as 2,600 uropathogenic bacteria in culture,  inoculated urine, and clinical urine samples was achieved within 45 min from the  beginning of sample processing. in a feasibility study of this amperometric detection system using blinded clinical urine specimens, the sensor array had 100% sensitivity for direct detection of gram-negative bacteria without nucleic acid purification or amplification. identification was demonstrated for 98% of gram-negative bacteria for which species-specific probes were available. when combined with a microfluidics-based sample preparation module, the integrated system could serve as a point-of-care device for rapid diagnosis of urinary tract infections.

AB  == we report multifocal detection (four different cities in northern italy) of proteus mirabilis isolates resistant to both oxyimino- and 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins and producing a novel acquired ampc-like beta-lactamase. the enzyme, named cmy-16, is a variant of the cmy/lat lineage, which differs from the closest homologues, cmy-4 and cmy-12, by a single amino acid substitution (a171s or n363s, respectively) and from cmy-2 by two substitutions (a171s and w221r). expression of the cloned bla(cmy-16) gene in escherichia coli decreased susceptibility to penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam. tazobactam was more effective than clavulanate at antagonizing the enzyme activity. genotyping, by random amplification of polymorphic dna and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic dna digested with sfii, showed that isolates were clonally related to each other, although not identical. the bla(cmy-16) gene was not transferable to e. coli by conjugation or transformation. in all isolates, it was chromosomally located and inserted in a conserved genetic environment. pcr mapping experiments revealed that the bla(cmy-16) was flanked by isecp1 and the blc gene, similar to other genes of this lineage from plasmids of salmonella enterica, klebsiella spp., and e. coli.  overall, these results revealed multifocal spreading of a cmy-16-producing p. mirabilis clone in northern italy. this finding represents the first report of an acquired ampc-like beta-lactamase in proteus mirabilis from italy and underscores the emergence of similar resistance determinants in the european setting.

AB  == microbiological cultures from 229 patients seeking medical advise in stockholm after the tsunami catastrophe december 2004 were analysed at the clinical microbiology laboratory, karolinska university hospital, stockholm, sweden. gram-negative rods were the most common findings from wound cultures. common human pathogens as escherichia coli, proteus species, klebsiella spp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. however, more rare species of gram-negative rods were also isolated, e.g. myroides odoratus, sphingomonas paucimobilis and bergeyella zoohelcum. resistance towards ordinary antibiotics was higher compared to our swedish reference material for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and acinetobacter spp, but not for pseudomonas aeruginosa. possibly, this reflects that the resistant isolates were nosocomially acquired in asia.

TI  == evaluation of a novel kit for the rapid detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == since a method of rapidly detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in gram-negative isolates from patients with severe infection is urgently required, the present study of a novel commercial kit was conducted. the cica-beta test i (kanto chemical, tokyo, japan) is designed for the rapid detection of esbl in gram-negative bacteria directly from isolated colonies in a  15-min protocol. in this study, a total of 304 strains of klebsiella spp., escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were tested using the novel kit and the phenotypic confirmatory disk test using cefotaxime and ceftazidime with and without clavulanate. the kit showed 95.5 and 98.1% sensitivity and specificity, respectively, as compared to the disk test, and thus proved to be an appropriate  tool for the rapid detection of esbl.

TI  == acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in general practice: clinical  and microbiological cure rates after three- versus five-day treatment with trimethoprim.
AB  == objectives: epidemiological studies indicate that acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uti) in women can be successfully treated with short treatment  regimens. however, the findings from the literature do not match experiences in daily practice. methods: a randomised, controlled trial evaluating the microbiological and clinical (self-reported) cure rates of a three-day vs. five-day treatment regimen with trimethoprim for uti in women. results: no statistically significant difference in bacteriological cure rate was found between the three-day and five-day regimen. one day after the shorter regimen 44% of women considered themselves as 'not-recovered' due to persistence of the symptoms compared with 35% after the five-day treatment (p > 0.05). three days after therapy these percentages were 30 and 25% respectively. conclusion: the relatively high percentage of persistent symptoms one day after the three-day regimen might be responsible for general practitioners believing that short regimens are not successful. it is therefore advisable that if urine samples are  controlled to wait at least three days after finishing treatment.

TI  == novel plasmid-mediated 16s rrna methylase, rmtc, found in a proteus mirabilis isolate demonstrating extraordinary high-level resistance against various aminoglycosides.
AB  == proteus mirabilis ars68, which demonstrated a very high level of resistance to various aminoglycosides, was isolated in 2003 from an inpatient in japan. the aminoglycoside resistance of this strain could not be transferred to recipient strains escherichia coli csh-2 and e. coli hb101 by a general conjugation experiment, but e. coli dh5alpha was successfully transformed by electroporation  with the plasmid of the parent strain, ars68, and acquired an unusually high degree of resistance against aminoglycosides. cloning and sequencing analyses revealed that the presence of a novel 16s rrna methylase gene, designated rmtc, was responsible for resistance in strain ars68 and its transformant. the g+c content of rmtc was 41.1%, and the deduced amino acid sequences of the newly identified 16s rrna methylase, rmtc, shared a relatively low level of identity (< or = 29%) to other plasmid-mediated 16s rrna methylases, rmta, rmtb, and arma, which have also been identified in pathogenic gram-negative bacilli. also, rmtc shared a low level of identity (< or = 28%) with the other 16s rrna methylases found in aminoglycoside-producing actinomycetes. the purified histidine-tagged rmtc clearly showed methyltransferase activity against e. coli 16s rrna in vitro. rmtc was located downstream of an isecp1-like element containing tnpa. several plasmid-mediated 16s rrna methylases have been identified in pathogenic gram-negative bacilli belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, and some of them are dispersing worldwide. the acceleration of aminoglycoside resistance among gram-negative bacilli by producing plasmid-mediated 16s rrna methylases, such as rmtc, rmtb, and rmta, may indeed become an actual clinical hazard in the  near future.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of the successive or staggered use of eardrops.
AB  == chronic suppurative otitis media is still a significant health problem. several topical agents such as antibacterials, steroids and acid media eardrops are widely used alone or in combination to control active otorrhea and obtain a dry ear. patients frequently ask if there is any benefit or loss in the effect of these due to their use in a successive or staggered manner. this question led us  to design this in vitro study to investigate the effect of the acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate on the antimicrobial effects of some  ototopical antibiotics during their successive or staggered usage. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli were used  for testing the antimicrobial activities of the selected antibiotic drops. six microliters of acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were used  alone or together with 6 microl each of ciprofloxacin hcl, tobramycin and ofloxacin solution. drops were placed on whatman no. 1 paper disks with a diameter of 6 mm, and the disks were placed onto mueller-hinton agar plates on which bacteria had been swabbed over the entire surface. after overnight incubation of the plates at 35 degrees c, the diameters of the inhibition zones were recorded. there was no antibacterial effect in response to either acid solution or dexamethasone used alone. the inhibition zones of the antibiotics did not change with either steroid or acid media solution added onto the antibiotic disks alone or together. acid solution or steroids should be preferred to use in  combination with antibacterial otic drugs in in-vivo settings; no negative or positive effects were seen in in-vitro conditions. therefore, prescribed eardrops can be used in a successive or staggered manner without any influence on the treatment results.

TI  == case analysis of purple urine-bag syndrome at a long-term care service in a community hospital.
AB  == background: purple urine-bag syndrome (pubs) is a rare phenomenon in which the contents of urine bags turn purple or blue following patient catheterization. the condition often causes care givers tremendous distress. we investigated the prevalence and possible causes of pubs for a group of elderly patients. methods:  a total of 157 patients featuring urine catheterization, 13 of whom exhibiting pubs were analyzed with regards to age, functional status, duration of catheterization, number of daily medications, living location, feeding route, bowel habits, and the pattern of use of a urinary catheter. urine samples were cultured from all the pubs patients participating. results: two men who underwent cystostomy and 11 women who underwent urethral catheterization who exhibited pubs were observed for this study. the age, duration of catheterization, number of daily medications feeding pattern and functional status between the group exhibiting pubs and the group of patients without pubs demonstrated no significant differences. a total of 69.2% of the pubs-affected patients, as compared to 43.1% of the non-pubs patients, lived in nursing homes, and 84.6% of  the pubs-affected patients were constipated, as were 66% of the non-pubd subjects. in total, 72.7% of pubs patients were reported to be using a laxative suppository, compared with 41% of the non-pubs group, whereas 92.3% of pubs patients were catheterized using a plastic (pvc) foley, as compared to 70.8% of the non-pubs patients. the ph for 12 out of 13 pubs patients' urine was > or = 7. escherichia coli, provendicia var. spp., proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae were the common pathogens isolated from the urine samples provided by our pubs patients. conclusion: we found that pubs was more likely associated with the female gender, alkaline urine, constipation, institutionalization, the use of a plastic (pvc) urinary catheter, and certain bacteria such as provendicia var. spp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == dna sequence analysis of the genetic environment of various blactx-m genes.
AB  == objectives: over a 3 year period (2000-2003) 21 escherichia coli, 5 klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 serratia marcescens and 1 proteus mirabilis producing ctx-m-type beta-lactamase were collected from five different hospitals in paris, france. this study was conducted to analyse the genetic environment of these 28 bla(ctx-m) genes. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by  the disc diffusion method and mics of various beta-lactams were determined by an  agar dilution method. pcr was used to detect and sequence alleles encoding ctx-m, tem, shv and cmy enzymes. the genetic environment was analysed by amplification and direct sequencing using various set of pcr primers or cloning in pbk-cmv. results: sequence analysis revealed that these isolates contained seven different bla(ctx-m) genes: bla(ctx-m-1) (4 strains), bla(ctx-m-2) (2 strains), bla(ctx-m-3) (4 strains), bla(ctx-m-9) (1 strain), bla(ctx-m-14) (5 strains), bla(ctx-m-15) (11 strains), bla(ctx-m-24) (1 strain). tem-1 was associated with ctx-m-type enzymes in 15 isolates. two strains produced both ctx-m-15 and shv-2 or ctx-m-14 and cmy-2. in 25 strains the insertion sequence isecp1 was located upstream of the 5' end of the bla(ctx-m) gene. among these strains, in five isolates, isecp1 was disrupted by insertion sequences such as is26 (in three of them) or is1 or is10. insertion sequence is903 was found downstream of bla(ctx-m-14) or bla(ctx-m-24). examination of the other three bla(ctx-m) genes (two bla(ctx-m-2) and one bla(ctx-m-9)) by cloning, sequencing and pcr analysis revealed the presence of complex class 1 integrons, in35, an integron similar to  in60 and a novel integron. conclusions: this work further confirmed the predominant role of isecp1 in the mobilization of bla(ctx-m) genes of the ctx-m-1 cluster and the presence of in35, of an integron similar to in60 and a novel complex class 1 integron.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica).
AB  == the goal of the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained  in various geographic regions in the usa and canada. forty-one medical centres (30 from the usa and 11 from canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. susceptibility testing was determined using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) microdilution method. resistance breakpoints used were those published by the nccls, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/ml), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (smx/tmp) (resistant > or = 4 microg/ml), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or =  4 microg/ml) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/ml). of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the usa and 24.9% (496) were collected from canada. the mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. the most common organisms were escherichia coli (57.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), enterococcus spp. (6.6%), proteus mirabilis (5.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), citrobacter spp. (2.7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), klebsiella spp. (1.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to smx/tmp, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. for the 1142 e. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, smx/tmp 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. for all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 e. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in us compared with canadian medical centres. this study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in us versus canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == n,n-dichlorotaurine: chemical and bactericidal properties.
AB  == the biogenous antimicrobial agent n-chlorotaurine (nct) converts by disproportionation to n,n-dichlorotaurine (ndct) at a rate proportional to acidity. this occurs at appreciable amounts already in weakly acidic biological systems. to understand the consequences of ndct formation, a thorough investigation of this undescribed compound was mandatory, which needed its synthesis. differently from nct, this was possible in the aqueous system using trichloroisocyanuric acid. while the free acid, cl(2)hnch(2)ch(2)so(3)h, was not  available in pure form, its sodium and potassium salts were analytically pure and showed melting points (decomposition) of 125-128 degrees c (potassium) and 162-164 degrees c (sodium). the sodium salt demonstrated unexpected long-term stability even at room temperature (8.4 % loss of activity within 4 months). the  aqueous solutions of both salts exhibited a weak acid reaction, and they were less stable than nct. with regard to chlorination of amines (transhalogenation),  ndct was, surprisingly, less efficacious than nct, which manifested itself by a lack of reactivity at ph < 7, for which a mechanistic explanation is given. compared on a molar scale, ndct was more bactericidal than nct against the gram-negative bacteria e. coli, p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis, while there was no difference concerning the gram-positive ones, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. the increase of bactericidal activity at acidic ph was the same as observed with  nct and is attributed to a higher susceptibility of bacteria in this environment. taken together, ndct seems not to be suited to substitute nct as a preparation fit for medical practice.

TI  == the ability of proteus mirabilis to sense surfaces and regulate virulence gene expression involves flil, a flagellar basal body protein.
AB  == proteus mirabilis is a urinary tract pathogen that differentiates from a short swimmer cell to an elongated, highly flagellated swarmer cell. swarmer cell differentiation parallels an increased expression of several virulence factors, suggesting that both processes are controlled by the same signal. the molecular nature of this signal is not known but is hypothesized to involve the inhibition  of flagellar rotation. in this study, data are presented supporting the idea that conditions inhibiting flagellar rotation induce swarmer cell differentiation and  implicating a rotating flagellar filament as critical to the sensing mechanism. mutations in three genes, flil, flif, and flig, encoding components of the flagellar basal body, result in the inappropriate development of swarmer cells in noninducing liquid media or hyperelongated swarmer cells on agar media. the flil  mutation was studied in detail. flil- mutants are nonmotile and fail to synthesize flagellin, while complementation of flil restores wild-type cell elongation but not motility. overexpression of flil+ in wild-type cells prevents  swarmer cell differentiation and motility, a result also observed when p. mirabilis flil+ was expressed in escherichia coli. these results suggest that flil plays a role in swarmer cell differentiation and implicate flil as critical  to transduction of the signal inducing swarmer cell differentiation and virulence gene expression. in concert with this idea, defects in flil up-regulate the expression of two virulence genes, zapa and hpmb. these results support the hypothesis that p. mirabilis ascertains its location in the environment or host by assessing the status of its flagellar motors, which in turn control swarmer cell gene expression.

TI  == regional variation in the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates in the asia-pacific region (sentry 1998-2002).
AB  == we examined the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter koseri, and salmonella spp. that were isolated as part of  the sentry asia-pacific surveillance program between 1998 and 2002. during the study period, a total of 6,388 strains were gathered from 17 medical centers in 7 countries and examined for esbl production and hyperproduction of k. oxytoca chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase enzyme. high rates of confirmed esbl-producing isolates were found in k. pneumoniae strains from singapore (35.6%), followed by  those from mainland china (30.7%), south africa (28.1%), and the philippines (21.9%), whereas the rates were less than 10% in japan and australia. esbl-producing e. coli strains were also prominent in mainland china (24.5%), hong kong (14.3%), and singapore (11.3%). esbl-producing k. oxytoca were common in the philippines (38.5%), singapore (33.3%), and china (30.0%). hyperproduction of k. oxytoca chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase enzyme was common in australia and japan. p. mirabilis strains from singapore produced esbl (17.9%) despite the low  prevalence (0-8.1%) in other countries. few esbl-producing c. koseri and salmonella spp. strains were found in japan, singapore, taiwan, and south africa. although there was variation among countries in substrate preference, ceftazidime was more likely to detect presumptive esbl phenotype in k. pneumoniae and aztreonam more likely in e. coli, whereas ceftriaxone was the best substrate for  the confirmation of esbl production. esbl-producing strains showed high levels of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. imipenem retained activity against all esbl-producing strains. organisms expressing esbls are widely distributed in the asia-pacific region, although prevalence rates vary significantly.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of leg ulcer bacterial flora in patients hospitalized at dermatology department, poznan university hospital.
AB  == effective treatment of frequently infected, poorly healing wounds such as leg ulcers due to chronic venous insufficiency poses a major clinical problem. antibiotic resistance in dermatology patients, especially those with non-healing  leg ulcers, is a widespread phenomenon. various antibiotics, mainly broad-spectrum agents, are frequently and sometimes inappropriately prescribed, which often leads to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains. the  aim of this study was to analyze antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of bacterial isolates cultured from leg ulcers. wound swabs were obtained from patients admitted to dermatology department, poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period. bacteriologic diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. the analysis yielded 173 positive results, predominated by staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. bacterial isolates were evaluated for resistance to commonly used antibiotics, taking into consideration the presence of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus strains. antibiotic resistance profiles were compared between the years 1998 and 2002, with detailed account of clinical characteristics and history of leg ulcers disease. the study pointed to an increasing tendency of antibiotic resistance in the study group of patients.

TI  == antibacterial activity of zuccagnia punctata cav. ethanolic extracts.
AB  == the present study was conducted to investigate antibacterial activity of zuccagnia punctata ethanolic extract against 47 strains of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria and to identify bioactive compounds. inhibition of bacterial growth was investigated using agar diffusion, agar macrodilution, broth microdilution and bioautographic methods. zuccagnia punctata extract was active against all assayed bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia) with minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranging from 25 to 200 microg/ml. minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) values were identical or two-fold higher than the corresponding mic values. contact bioautography, indicated that zuccagnia punctata extracts possess one major antibacterial component against pseudomonas aeruginosa and at least three components against. klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. activity-guided fractionation of 1he  ethanol extract on a silica gel column yielded a compound (2',4'-dihydroxychalcone), which exhibited strong antibacterial activity with mic values between 0.10 and 1.00 microg/ml for proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia. these values are lower than imipenem (0.25-16 microg/ml). zuccagnia punctata might provide promising therapeutic agents against infections with multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel derivatives of benzofuran: part 1. synthesis and antimicrobial activity of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl) ketoxime derivatives.
AB  == the reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. new derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such  as, o-glycidylketoxime (4) and o-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted n-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. the syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. all of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis atcc 14153 and candida albicans atcc 10231. among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-o-[2-hydroxy-3-(n-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against s. aureus atcc 6538. the compounds 2, 5b, 6b,  6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against c. albicans atcc 10231. similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-o-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against c. albicans atcc 10231. none of the other compounds  exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.

TI  == elevated levels of igm and iga antibodies to proteus mirabilis and igm antibodies to escherichia coli are associated with early rheumatoid factor (rf)-positive rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == objective: antibodies to proteus mirabilis were previously detected in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (ra). we examined the prevalence of antibodies to p. mirabilis and their associations with ra in early synovitis patients. methods: two hundred and forty-six patients with inflammatory arthritis for less than 1 yr were prospectively evaluated for 1 yr. of these patients, 30%  had rheumatoid factor (rf)-positive ra, 16% rf-negative ra, 17% a spondyloarthropathy and 37% undifferentiated arthritis. serum antibodies to p. mirabilis, escherichia coli and other potentially arthritogenic organisms (chlamydia, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, yersinia and parvovirus b19) and for antibodies specific for immunoglobulin (ig) g damaged with advanced glycation end-products (anti-igg-age) were measured. results: igm and iga anti-proteus antibodies were significantly higher in patients with rf-positive ra compared with all other patient groups (p < 0.0005 and p < 0.005). anti-p. mirabilis igg,  and igg, iga, and igm antibodies to other potentially arthritogenic pathogens did not differ in the patient groups. igm antibodies to e. coli were elevated in rf-positive ra patients. anti-p. mirabilis igm and iga results were not explained by false-positive reactions, because after absorption of rf there was no decrease in antibodies to proteus in 10 of 12 patients. proteus and e. coli antibodies were highest in patients positive for both rf and anti-igg-age antibodies (p<0.001). patients with erosions tended to have higher iga anti-proteus titres,  but no association with the shared hla epitope or treatment was detected. conclusion: anti-p. mirabilis igm and iga and anti-e. coli igm antibody elevations are associated with early seropositive ra and the presence of anti-igg-age antibodies. the role that p. mirabilis or e. coli plays in early rf-positive ra requires further investigation.

TI  == effects of lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria on the level of thiols in blood platelets.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin, lps) activates blood platelets and stimulates generation of free radicals in these cells. the mechanism of platelet activation  induced by lps is not known. the aim of the present study was to examine how glutathione (gsh) and other thiol-containing compounds are involved in the oxidative stress in blood platelets caused by lps. the hplc technique has been used on the analysis of non-protein thiols from human blood platelets treated with lipopolysaccharides of different gram-negative bacteria (proteus mirabilis,  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). our results show that lpss caused an increase (about 10%) of the level of reduced glutathione (gsh) and other nonprotein thiols such as cysteine (csh) and cysteinylglycine (cgsh), whereas the total pool of these compounds was almost unchanged. lps may react directly with thiols, since after incubation of lpss with glutathione alone (in reduced form) we observed a distinct decrease of the level of platelet gsh.

AB  == the antibacterial and antioxidant activity of the ethanol extract from paullinia  cupana var. sorbilis mart. (sapindaceae) seeds, commonly called guarana, was assessed towards selected bacteria as well as in different antioxidant models. the extract, at a concentration between 16 and 128 microg/ml, showed a significant antibacterial effect expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. in particular, pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic=16 microg/ml), proteus mirabilis (mic=32 microg/ml),  proteus vulgaris (mic=32 microg/ml) and escherichia coli (mic=32 microg/ml) were  the most inhibited. the antioxidant activity was determined by the malonyldialdehyde (mda) test, measuring the mda concentration in 3t3-l1 cells after induced cellular damage using ferric ammonium citrate (fac). the reduction  of lipid peroxidation was 62.5% using a guarana extract with a concentration of 2 microg/ml. this effect was dose/dependent. the ethanol extract from paullinia cupana seeds was analysed by spectrophotometry to determine the concentration of  catechol substances after treatment of the extract with p-aminophenol. the total  phenolics content in the ethanol extract was also determined spectrophotometrically according to the folin-ciocalteu procedure and calculated  as gallic acid equivalents (gae). the concentration of catechol equivalent was 6.06+/-0.13 mg/g (mean+/-s.d.), while the total phenolic content was 8.43+/-0.21  mg/g (mean+/-s.d.). the correlation index between antioxidant activity and catechol content was 0.96.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of contemporary pathogens from uncomplicated urinary tract infections isolated in a multicenter italian survey:  possible impact on guidelines.
AB  == during 2004 four italian laboratories assessed the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis in female out-patients. a total of 600 urine samples from individuals aged 18-65 were studied. the overall prevalence of escherichia coli was 85.3%. klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus saprophyticus, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and other rarer species were far less represented. determination of the  antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the entire collection of e. coli (512 organisms) revealed that among the drugs analyzed ampicillin was the least active molecule with only 62.5% of the strains being inhibited. amoxicillin-clavulanate  and cefuroxime displayed a higher potency (87.7% and 89.2% respectively). cotrimoxazole inhibited only 70.1% of the uropathogens. the three fluoquinolones  tested had comparable activity ranging from 83.0% for ciprofloxacin, to 83.6% for levofloxacin and 84.9% for prulifloxacin, indicating an identical spectrum of cross resistance. nitrofurantoin (96.7%) and fosfomycin (98.6%) were the most potent drugs. against the whole collection of uropathogens, only cefuroxime, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin overcame the threshold of 90% activity, with the fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin-clavulanate suffering from about 15% resistance. the results of this survey strongly support the conclusions of recent italian guidelines concerning the best empiric treatment of uti in this country today.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == the first beta-lactamase was identified in an isolate of escherichia coli in 1940. to date, there are >130 tem-type and >50 sulfhydryl variable (shv)-type beta-lactamases, mainly in e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis  but also in other members of the enterobacteriaceae family and in some nonenteric organisms, such as acinetobacter species. the incidence of expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) varies, depending on which area of the globe the isolates originate from. esbls render the oxyimino-cephalosporins ineffective, and esbl-producing organisms frequently also possess resistance factors to other classes of antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, and possibly also piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime. these results suggest that microbiology laboratories should routinely test for the presence of these strains among their isolates and that the antibiotics of choice for infections believed to be caused by these types of organisms are the carbapenems.

AB  == sixty-four multidrug-resistant isolates of proteus mirabilis were collected from  retail meat products in oklahoma. the isolates showed four different patterns of  antibiotic resistance based on their resistant phenotype and genotypes. most of these isolates were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamycin, and kanamycin. class 1 integrons were detected as a common carrier of the antibiotic-resistant genes, such as aada1, aadb, and aada2. a few isolates (9%) contained class 2 integrons with three gene cassettes included: dhfr1, sat1, and  aada1. these isolates were even resistant to nalidixic acid due to mutations in gyra and parc. all ampicillin-resistant isolates contained blatem-1. plasmids that contained class 1 or 2 integrons and blatem-1 were able to be transferred from p. mirabilis isolates into escherichia coli by conjugation, indicating that  conjugal transfer could contribute to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance  genes between the enterobacteriaceae species.

AB  == introduction: xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a morphologically and clinically unique manifestation of chronic pyelonephritis with the formation of pus or granulomas. the most frequent predisposing factors for the development of  xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis are urinary obstruction (e. g., stones, tumors, congenital anomalies and functional impairment) and infection of the collecting system. case report: we describe a 2-year-old female patient with unclear abdominal complaints, diarrhea, malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, pale skin color, and recurrent and undulating fever in the presence of known left nephrolithiasis. based on the clinical examination and imaging, above all, ct, the presumptive diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis of the left kidney was made. a left lumbar nephrectomy was performed and histology confirmed  the diagnosis. conclusion: xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a relatively rare entity that is associated with obstruction (e. g., stones) and infection of  the urinary tract. its rarity and resultant unfamiliarity often delay diagnosis and therapy, which in turn affect the prognosis. furthermore, this entity can be  mistaken for renal tumors (renal cell carcinoma and wilms tumor), but nowadays this should be mostly eliminated with the advances in the imaging methods.

TI  == ampc disk test for detection of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae lacking chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases.
AB  == although plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases were first reported in the late 1980s, many infectious disease personnel remain unaware of their clinical importance. these enzymes are typically produced by isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. and are associated with multiple antibiotic resistance that leaves few therapeutic options. plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases have been associated with false in vitro susceptibility to cephalosporins. many laboratories do not test for this resistance mechanism because current tests are inconvenient, subjective, lack sensitivity and/or specificity, or require reagents that are not readily available. in this study a new test, the ampc disk test, based on filter paper disks impregnated with edta, was found to be a highly sensitive, specific, and convenient means of detection of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases in organisms lacking a chromosomally mediated ampc beta-lactamase. using cefoxitin insusceptibility as a screen, the test accurately distinguished ampc and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production and differentiated ampcs from non-beta-lactamase mechanisms of cefoxitin insusceptibility, such as reduced outer membrane permeability. the test is a potentially useful diagnostic tool. it can provide important infection control information and help to ensure that infected patients receive appropriate antibiotic therapy.

AB  == a prospective study to determine the causative agents of catheter-related bacteriuria was carried out on 99 patients with median age of 55 years, on admission in the oncology, paediatric surgery and obstetric and gynaecology wards of the lagos university teaching hospital. there was significant bacteriuria in seventy-one (72%) of the 99 urine samples. all catheter urine samples were contaminated by day 5 gram-negative bacilli were predominant (89.3%) of which pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.2%) was the most common, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes accounted for 15.5% each, closely followed by proteus mirabilis (14.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (9.5%). the gram positive isolates enterococcus faecalis (8.3%) and staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.4%) made up only 10.7% of isolates. most of the isolates from catheterised patients were resistant to the common antibiotics such as ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin and ceftriaxone with high susceptibility to ofloxacin and ceftazidime though the isolates of enterococcus faecalis was also resistant to ofloxacin. however, isolates of s. saprophyticus were still susceptible to the penicillins and tetracycline.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance transformation in community-acquired urinary infections].
AB  == objective: to detect the prevalence of uropathogens in community-acquired urinary tract infection in our environment, and the degree of sensitivity to antibiotics  used as empirical treatment. patients and method: retrospective longitudinal study on 16,392 consecutive urine cultures collected in the emergency department  of hospital del mar, between january 1997 and december 2001. resistance rates were compared through variance analysis. results: 8,743 urine cultures with significant count were obtained. 6,062 escherichia coli (69.3%), 517 proteus mirabilis (5.9%) and 390 klebsiella pneumoniae (4.5%) were identified. escherichia coli showed progressive growth rate and significant resistances to most of antibiotics evaluated, especially to quinolones which came close to 30%.  fosfomycin showed the least resistance rate (0.9%) and remained stable along the  years studied. conclusions: these results suggest that higher rate of resistance  to quinolones does not advise its use as empirical in community-acquired urinary  tract infection treatment in our environment. according to our experience, fosfomycin can be an excellent option for cystitis treatment in patients without  risk factors, while for the treatment of parenchymatous urinary tract infection,  complicated urinary tract infections, and urinary tract infections associated to  risk factors, preference could be second or third generation oral cephalosporins, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.

TI  == adaptation to extreme environments: macromolecular dynamics in complex systems.
AB  == what we previously thought of as insurmountable physical and chemical barriers to life, we now see as yet another niche harbouring 'extremophiles'. extremophiles and their macromolecules had to develop molecular mechanisms of adaptation to extreme physico-chemical conditions. using neutron spectroscopy, we have demonstrated that molecular dynamics represents one of these molecular mechanisms of adaptation. to which extent do hyper-saline conditions and extreme temperatures influence molecular dynamics? first, molecular dynamics were analysed for halophilic malate dehydrogenase from haloarcula marismortui (hm maldh) under different molar solvent salt concentration conditions influencing its stability. secondly, mean macromolecular motions were measured in-vivo in psychrophile (aquaspirillum arcticum), mesophile (escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis), thermophile (thermus thermophilus), and hyperthermophile (aquifex pyrofilus) bacteria. the mean constant force of hm maldh increases progessively with increasing stability. the results show that the molecular adaptation of hm maldh to hyper-saline conditions is achieved through an increasing resilience of  its structure dominated by enthalpic mechanisms. the study of bacteria has provided tools to quantify the macromolecular adaptation to extreme temperatures  in the naturally crowded environment of the cell. the macromolecular resilience of bacteria increases with adaptation to high temperatures.

AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of recently emerging cefoxitin-resistant and induction-positive isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and proteus mirabilis. strains  of enterobacteriaceae were isolated at a korean tertiary care hospital between june and december 2002. induction was tested using cefoxitin and aztreonam disks, the bladha allele was detected by pcr, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) patterns were also analyzed. among the cefoxitin-resistant isolates, 2.7%  of e. coli, 21.1% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 32.0% of klebsiella oxytoca, and 8.3% of p. mirabilis isolates showed induction, and were bladha-1 allele positive. to  the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of bladha-1 in p. mirabilis.  the mics of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam increased significantly by higher inoculum, suggesting that their clinical usefulness is limited. presence of multiple pfge patterns and identical patterns in some isolates suggest that the widely disseminated bladha-1 in klebsiella species was because of both horizontal and clonal spread.

TI  == prulifloxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of adults with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == introduction: the present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 10-day regimen of prulifloxacin 600 mg once daily as compared to ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (utis). materials and methods: 257 patients (mean age +/- sd 62.3 +/- 16.5) were enrolled and orally treated with prulifloxacin (127 patients) or ciprofloxacin (130 patients). the study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, controlled clinical trial. the primary efficacy parameter was the eradication of infecting strains (<10(3) cfu/ml). the  clinical outcome and tolerability were also assessed. results: at baseline, the most common infecting strains were escherichia coli (62.8%), proteus mirabilis (7.1%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%). at the early follow-up, the rate of patients showing successful treatment was 90.8% in the prulifloxacin group, and 77.8% in the ciprofloxacin group (p = 0.008). a positive clinical outcome was observed in 94.8 and 93.3% of prulifloxacin- and ciprofloxacin-treated patients.  both drugs were well tolerated. two patients dropped out for treatment-related adverse events. conclusions: the high urinary concentrations of prulifloxacin, combined with a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, allow its use in the empiric therapy of utis.

TI  == detection of paragonimus heterotremus eggs in experimentally infected cats by a polymerase chain reaction-based method.
AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) procedure for the detection of paragonimus heterotremus eggs in stool samples was developed and compared with stoll's egg count method. the primers were designed on the basis of a previously constructed  pph-13-specific dna probe, which produced an approximate 0.5-kb amplified product. this pcr method could detect as few as 5 eggs in 0.6 g of artificially inoculated feces of a healthy control cat or as little as 1 x 10(-4) ng of p. heterotremus genomic dna. the assay had 100% sensitivity in all infected cats. the method did not yield an approximate 0.5-kb product with dna from other parasites such as gnathostoma spinigerum, trichinella spiralis, fasciola gigantica, echinostoma malayanum, opisthorchis viverrini, dirofilaria immitis, and taenia saginata; exceptions were paragonimus siamensis and paragonimus westermani. in addition, no genomic dna from escherichia coli, burkholderia pseudomallei, acinetobacter anitratus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, beta-streptococcus gra, and proteus mirabilis or from the vertebrate and  invertebrate hosts of p. heterotremus was amplified in the pcr assay. this assay  has great potential for application in clinical epidemiological studies.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 11,475 clinical isolates obtained from 52 centers in 2002].
AB  == the susceptibilities of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (fqs), especially levofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents were investigated using 11,475 clinical isolates collected in japan during 2002. methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, the family of enterobactericeae, haemophilus influenzae and acinetobacter spp. exhibited stable and high susceptibilities to fqs. the rate of fqs-resistant mrsa was 80 approximately 90%, being markedly higher than that of fqs-resistant mssa. the fqs-resistance rate of mrcns was also higher than that of mscns, however, it was lower than that of mrsa. no fqs-resistant clinical isolates of salmonella spp. were detected in any of the surveys. thirteen of escherichai coli 696 isolates, 8 of klebsiella pneumoniae 630 isolates and 33 of  proteus mirabilis 373 isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl),  furthermore 6 of 13 in e. coli, 1 of 8 in k. pneumoniae and 14 of 31 esbl-producing isolates, and in p. mirabilis were fqs resistant. attention should be focused in the future on the emergence of esbl in relation to fqs resistance.  the rate of fqs-resistant p. aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infection (uti) was 40 approximately 60%, while 15 approximately 25% of isolates from respiratory tract infection (rti) were resistant. imp-1 type metallo beta-lactamase producing organisms were found in 49 of p. aeruginosa 1,095 isolates, 7 of s. marcescens 586 isolates and 4 of acinetobacter spp. 474 isolates, respectively. glycopeptide-resistant enterococci or s. aureus was not found.

TI  == chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  == objectives: although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely  clarified. using n-chlorotaurine (nct), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. it was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. methods: pathogens were incubated in nct, which was subsequently washed off. the oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. results: superficial chlorination in the form of covalent n-cl bonds to staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. for s. aureus, 3 min incubation with nct produced a cover of  3.3 x 10(-16) mol cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. the kind of microorganism, coating time, ph, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. the relative cover strength on  s. aureus by nct, chloramine t, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or n,n-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees c (>8 h at 1 degrees c), even  without a reduction of cfu. however, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal nh(2)cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. conclusions: the chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. furthermore, it may be a decisive  step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of ibafloxacin in micro-organisms isolated from cats.
AB  == the pharmacodynamic properties of ibafloxacin were investigated in micro-organisms isolated from cats. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of ibafloxacin (racemate, r- and s-enantiomers) and its metabolites (7-hydroxy- and  8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin) and time-kill kinetics were determined against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria isolated from dermal and respiratory and urinary tract infections in cats. racemic ibafloxacin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria. escherichia coli and pasteurella, klebsiella and staphylococcus spp. are commonly isolated from feline infections and all are susceptible to ibafloxacin (mic90 < or = 0.5 microg/ml), whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus spp. are considered intrinsic resistant. microbiological activity resides primarily in the s-enantiomer of ibafloxacin whereas the r-enantiomer is  less active. killing curves using concentrations of racemic ibafloxacin and 8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin, which are representative of the in vivo situation observed in cats, showed at least 99.9% reduction in viable bacterial isolates from feline clinical samples over 24 h. bacterial eradication was achieved in cats with cmax/mic and auc/mic values much lower than the target values previously established in man and laboratory animals. additional studies in dogs and cats are necessary to define more clearly the surrogate markers of antibacterial activity (i.e. cmax/mic, auc/mic ratios), which are associated with a good clinical response.

AB  == background: antibiotic resistance in the longterm-care facility (ltcf) setting is of increasing concern due to both the increased morbidity and mortality related to infections in this debilitated population and the potential for transfer of resistant organisms to other healthcare settings. longitudinal trends in antibiotic resistance in ltcfs have not been well described. design: correlational longitudinal survey study. setting: four ltcfs in pennsylvania. subjects: all clinical cultures of residents of the participating ltcfs (700 total beds) from 1998 through 2003. we assessed the annual prevalence of resistance to various antimicrobials of interest for the following organisms: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus species. results: a total of  4,954 clinical isolates were obtained during the study. a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was noted for many organism-drug combinations. this was  especially true for fluoroquinolone susceptibility among the enterobacteriaceae (susceptibility range, 51.3% to 92.2%). in addition, the prevalence of resistance to various agents differed significantly across study sites. finally, significant increasing trends in resistance were noted over time and were most pronounced for fluoroquinolone susceptibility among the enterobacteriaceae. conclusions: the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance has increased significantly in ltcfs, although trends have varied substantially across different institutions. these trends have been particularly pronounced for fluoroquinolone resistance among the enterobacteriaceae. these findings demonstrate that antimicrobial resistance is widespread and increasing in ltcfs, highlighting the need for future studies to more clearly elucidate the risk factors for, and potential interventions against, emerging resistance in these settings.

AB  == development of rapid molecular approaches for pathogen detection is key to improving treatment of infectious diseases. for this study, the kinetics and temperature-dependence of dna probe hybridization to uropathogen species-specific sequences were examined. a set of oligonucleotide probes were designed based on variable regions of the 16s gene of the escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a universal bacterial probe and probes-specific for gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were also included. the oligonucleotide probes discriminated among 16s genes derived from 11 different species of uropathogenic bacteria applied to nylon membranes in a dot-blot format. significant binding of oligonucleotide probes to target dna and  removal of nonspecific binding by membrane washing could both be achieved rapidly, requiring as little as 10 min. an oligonucleotide probe from the same species-specific region of the e. coli 16s gene was used as a capture probe in a  novel electrochemical 16-sensor array based on microfabrication technology. sequence-specific hybridization of target uropathogen 16s rdna was detected through horseradish peroxidase acting as an electrochemical transducer via a second, detector probe. the sensor array demonstrated rapid, species-specific hybridization in a time course consistent with the rapid kinetics of the dot-blot hybridization studies. as in the dot-blot hybridization studies, species-specific detection of bacterial nucleic acids using the sensor array approach was demonstrated both at 65 degrees c and at room temperature. these results demonstrate that molecular hybridization approaches can be adapted to rapid, room temperature conditions ideal for an electrochemical sensor array platform.

TI  == microbial resistance to antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections in mexican children.
AB  == urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in female children. this infection has a prevalence of 4.1 to 7.1% during infancy. the bacterial agents causing the urinary tract infection are escherichia coil (80-90%), followed by other gram negative germs such as klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococcus species and gram positive such as staphylococcus species. typical treatment for this infection is ampicillin or the mixture of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (tmt/smx) among others. however, a high incidence of microbial resistance to these antibiotics has been observed recently. the purpose of this study was to assess the microbial resistance of the most frequent infectious agents in urinary tract of mexican children from january to december 2000. a total of 725 urinary cultures were collected during all year. of these, 293 patients were positive of the most frequently reported bacteria including escherichia coil (205 patients, 69.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (67 patients, 22.8%) and proteus mirabilis (21 patients, 7.1%). infections produced by escherichia coil were highly resistant to ampicillin (83.5%) and tmt/smx (76.7%). results indicate a high incidence of microbial resistance to ampicillin and tmt/smx in urinary tract infections in mexican children and suggest caution before giving a treatment with antibiotic in this condition.

TI  == evaluation of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objective: we aimed to assess the performance of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of various species. methods: organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains comprising enterobacter aerogenes (3), enterobacter cloacae (10), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (26), klebsiella oxytoca (3) and proteus mirabilis (4). also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking esbls, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of ampc enzyme in citrobacter freundii (2), e. aerogenes (3), e. cloacae (3), e. coli (4), hafnia alvei (1) and morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase in k. pneumoniae (3) and e. coli (3) or hyperproduction of k1 enzyme in k. oxytoca (6). results: the microscan mic-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 esbl strains as esbl-positive and 23 of 30 non-esbl strains as esbl-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). false negatives among esbl producers were highest with enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between esbl and ampc beta-lactamases. false-positive classifications occurred in two acinetobacter spp., one e. coli producing plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase and two k. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. conclusion: the microscan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for esbl confirmation. however, this test has limitations in detecting esbls in enterobacter spp. and in discriminating esbl-related resistance from the k1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp.

TI  == bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in urinary isolates.
AB  == escherichia coli accounted for about 80% of organisms in uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis), followed by staphylococcus spp. especially staphylococcus saprophyticus, and proteus mirabilis. against e. coli isolates from patients with uncomplicated uti, faropenem was the most effective. up to 1999, fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were not observed in patients with uncomplicated uti, but in 2001 fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli isolates emerged and accounted for about 8%. various types of organisms were isolated in patients  with complicated uti. enterococcus faecalis, e. coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa  were the three most frequent organisms isolated. these three organisms accounted  for 44.6%. amongst oral agents, faropenem showed the lowest rate of resistance against e. coli followed by cephems. the rates of highly fluoroquinolone-resistant and cefpodoxime-resistant e. coli isolates increased rapidly from 1998 to 2001. fluoroquinolone-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates accounted for about 40% in 2001. against this species, amikacin was the most effective antimicrobials among all agents tested. about 17% of pseudomonas were resistant to carbapenem. eight milligram per litre of ampicillin inhibited all e. faecalis isolates; about 60% of enterococcus faecium were resistant to ampicillin. the rates of levofloxacin-resistant isolates of e. faecalis and e. faecium were 38 and 97% respectively. utis caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) are rare in japan.

TI  == proteus mirabilis zapa metalloprotease degrades a broad spectrum of substrates, including antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == the 54-kda extracellular metalloprotease zapa is an important virulence factor of uropathogenic proteus mirabilis. while zapa has the ability to degrade host immunoglobulins (igs), the dramatic attenuation of virulence in zapa mutants suggests that this enzyme may have a broader spectrum of activity. this hypothesis was tested by in vitro assays with purified zapa and an array of purified protein or peptide substrates. the data reveal that many proteins found  in the urinary tract are substrates of zapa proteolysis, including complement (c1q and c3), cell matrix (collagen, fibronectin, and laminin), and cytoskeletal  proteins (actin and tubulin). proteolysis of iga and igg was significantly enhanced by conditions that denatured the igs. it was discovered that the antimicrobial peptides human beta-defensin 1 (hbd1) and ll-37 are readily cleaved by the enzyme. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a bacterial protease capable of cleaving hbd1, a component of the human renal tubule innate immune response. proteolysis of hbd1 resulted in ca. six peptides,  while proteolysis of ll-37 resulted in at least nine products. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis of the molecular masses of the reaction products indicated that zapa preferred no distinct peptide bond. the antimicrobial activity of hbd1 and ll-37 was significantly reduced following zapa treatment, suggesting that proteolysis results in inactivation of these peptides. the data suggest that a function of zapa during urinary tract infections is the proteolysis of antimicrobial peptides associated with the innate immune response.

TI  == emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a european and north american surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  == background: globally icus are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. methods: antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant icu pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from the surveillance network (tsn) databases in europe (france, germany and italy), canada, and the united states (us). results: oxacillin resistance rates among staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. penicillin resistance  rates among streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in germany to as high as 20.2% in the us; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in germany to 3.4% in italy. vancomycin resistance rates among enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in france to 76.3% in the united states. putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production among enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among escherichia coli in the five countries studied. ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower  than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the enterobacteriaceae species examined. fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for e. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). p. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. imipenem was the most active compound tested against acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. conclusion: there was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. compared with other countries, italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of enterococcus spp., which were highest in the us. this data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in europe and north america and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of ave1330a, an innovative broad-spectrum non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  == objectives: production of beta-lactamases is the main mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in gram-negative bacteria. despite the current use of clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam, the prevalence of class a and class c enzymes is increasing worldwide, demanding new beta-lactamase inhibitors. here we report the antimicrobial properties of ave1330a, a representative of a novel class of bridged bicyclico[3.2.1]diazabicyclo-octanones in combination with ceftazidime. materials and methods: ic(50) and kinetic parameters of the hydrolysis reaction were used to characterize beta-lactamase inhibition by ave1330a. mics for >600 strains were determined with the combination ceftazidime/ave1330a at a fixed ratio of 4:1. results: ic(50)s of ave1330a for tem-1 and p99 enzymes were 0.0023  mg/l (8 nm) and 0.023 mg/l (80 nm), compared with 0.027 mg/l (130 nm) and 205.1 mg/l (1 x 10(6) nm) of clavulanic acid and 0.013 mg/l (40 nm) and 1.6 mg/l (5000  nm) of tazobactam. a highly stable covalent complex led to a low turnover of ave1330a. mics of ceftazidime/ave1330a for enterobacteriaceae were at least eight-fold lower than those of ceftazidime alone. all of the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter and proteus mirabilis strains, including ceftazidime-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 4-8 mg/l. only 2 mg/l were required to inhibit other proteeae, enterobacter, salmonella and serratia. conclusion: the combination of ceftazidime with ave1330a exhibited broad-spectrum activity against ambler class a- and class c-producing enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  == this study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (uti). during a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. fever higher than 38.5 degrees c was significantly more common in the bacteremic group  than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. e. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic uti than non-bacteremic uti (73% vs 49%; p<0.01).  bacteria other than e. coli (i.e., k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, proteus spp., morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, serratia marcescens, and providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic uti than bacteremic uti (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). e. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). isolates of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and  proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. the emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic uti in taiwan. further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial  resistance on the outcome in these conditions.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the role of haematogenous seeding in late prosthesis infection. in all, 45 male wistar albino rats were divided into three equal groups. a small piece of silicone prosthesis was implanted into the scrotum of all rats under sterile condition and antibiotic prophylaxis. in the first group, all silicones were removed after 6 months without any complication and were cultured for bacterial growth. in the second group, a disc, which was saturated with staphylococcus epidermidis, was inoculated subcutaneously in the legs of the rats in the 6th month, revealing a nodule formation 4-5 days after the inoculation and treated with an appropriate antibiotic after the nodule formation. in the third group, the same disc was inoculated, but all rats were treated immediately from the inoculation time onwards. the silicones of the second and third group were also removed at the end of the 6th month and were cultured to observe the bacterial growth. there was no evidence of prosthesis infection in any of the three groups. in the first group, three cultures were positive and revealed approximately 10 000 colonies of s. epidermidis in two and  proteus mirabilis in the remaining. three and four cultures were positive in the  second and third group, respectively. low colonies of four different organisms (escherichia coli, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa) were identified in these cultures. there was no statistical significance of positive cultures in the three groups. based on our results, there does not appear to be a true significance of haematogenous seeding on late prosthesis infection.

TI  == [bact-alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. first argentine multicentre study].
AB  == bact-alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. first argentine multicentre study. between january and december 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the bact-alert system (14,960 fan aerobics, 3,855 fan anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 fan pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of buenos aires city, one of la plata city and three  of the buenos aires province. a total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; enterococcus faecalis 1; streptococcus pneumoniae 2; campylobacter spp 1; escherichia coli 1; enterobacter cloacae 1; enterobacteraerogenes 1; citrobacter freundii 1; klebsiella pneumoniae 1; proteus mirabilis 1; serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of  cryptococcus neoformans). of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the  anaerobic standard (65% were propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the fan aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by fan pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and  1.4% by fan anaerobic bottle. our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the bact-alert system is unnecessary.

TI  == evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate esbl etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  == objectives: in this study, we evaluated the performance of a new esbl etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate esbl etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on enterobacter spp. methods: overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=10), escherichia coli (n=10), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and proteus mirabilis (n=3). to check etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to esbl, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of k. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. results: with this panel, esbl etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. concentrating on enterobacter spp., reliable esbl detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed esbl production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. a limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with k1 phenotypes of k. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. conclusion: the new etest esbl strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to  current methods for detection of esbls. in our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of esbls, particularly in enterobacter spp.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of recent antibiotic-resistant urinary pathogens to ertapenem and 12 other antibiotics.
AB  == background: the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections may require the use of a parenteral antibiotic with potent activity against the most common urinary pathogens. ertapenem is a broad-spectrum 1beta-methyl carbapenem with a long plasma half-life that allows administration of a single daily dose. methods: the purpose of this work was to test the in vitro susceptibility to ertapenem, ampicillin, cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, co-amoxiclav, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole of 482 strains of urinary pathogens of the family enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in the community of madrid (40%  from males). the distribution was as follows: escherichia coli (n = 315), proteus mirabilis (n = 42), klebsiella spp. (n = 14) and ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae (n = 111). the strains studied were selected based on their resistance to quinolones and aminoglycosides, and their production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) or ampc-type beta-lactamases. results:  all the strains were susceptible to ertapenem, imipenem and amikacin. the mic(90) of ertapenem ranged from a minimum of 0.03 mg/l for proteus vulgaris and a maximum of 1 mg/l for enterobacter spp. ertapenem was the most active of all drugs tested in all cases. on comparing antibiotic resistance among esbl-producing strains of e. coli (n = 35) and e. coli strains not producing esbls (n = 280), statistically significant differences were obtained for ciprofloxacin (p = 0.002) and gentamicin (p = 0.011). regarding ertapenem, only a slight increase in mic(50) was seen, the value being 0.015 mg/l for strains not producing esbls versus 0.03 mg/l for esbl-producing strains. conclusions: in view of its significant antibiotic potency against antibiotic-resistant enterobacteriaceae, ertapenem may constitute a good therapeutic alternative in urinary infections caused by these pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolates from inpatients and outpatients at yaounde central hospital, cameroon.
AB  == objective: to determine and compare antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogenic bacteria from inpatients and outpatients at a university teaching hospital in yaounde, cameroon. methods: gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 522), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) from inpatients and outpatients at yaounde central hospital between march 1995 and april 1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). results: of the 522 isolates recorded, 80.3% were enterobacteriaceae. a high incidence of resistance to amoxicillin (85%), piperacillin (75%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (71%) was observed. the proportion of antimicrobial-resistant isolates from inpatients was significantly  higher than that from outpatients (p < 0.05), except for piperacillin, tobramicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the combinations of antimicrobial and organism showed that the percentage of ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter cloacae were 26.8% and 24% respectively. the rate of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from inpatients was not significantly higher than that in isolates from outpatients for all the antimicrobial/organism combinations, except for ceftazidime-resistant escherichia coli, which was exclusively found in isolates from inpatients. among enterobacteriaceae, high and low level penicillinase (mostly in e. coli (13.6% and 11% respectively) and klebsiella spp. (9% and 8% respectively) were the most  important beta-lactam resistance phenotypes (31.2% and 23.6%, respectively). wild type (exclusively observed in e. coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella spp.) and low level penicillinase were higher in outpatient than inpatient isolates (wild type--17.9% vs 10.8% and low level penicillinase--29.4% vs 20.5%, respectively; p < 0.05). however, extended spectrum beta-lactamase strains (klebsiella spp. (3.5%), e. coli (2.6%), citrobacter spp. (0.7%), enterobacter spp. (0.4%) and p.  mirabilis (0.2%)) were exclusively recovered from inpatients. penicillinase and high level cephalosporinase resistance phenotypes were frequently observed in non-fermenter gram-negative bacilli (46.6% and 29.1% respectively). however, there were no significant differences in penicillinase and cephalosporinase resistance between inpatient and outpatient isolates. conclusion: as the incidence of antimicrobial resistance is substantially higher in isolates from inpatient than outpatient pathogens, more resources should be allocated within the hospital to encourage good antibiotic practices and good hospital hygiene.

TI  == [bacterial pathogens, resistance patterns and treatment options in community acquired pediatric urinary tract infection].
AB  == background: epidemiology and resistance patterns of bacterial pathogens in pediatric uti show large interregional variability and rates of bacterial resistances are changing due to different antibiotic treatment. we intended to evaluate data from northern germany. patients and methods: in 100 children (53 female, 47 male, mean age 4.4 +/- 4.2 years) with community acquired uti, who presented in the emergency department of our medical school from 2000 - 2002, urine cultures were performed. inclusion criteria were: acute voiding symptoms, significant bacteriuria with growth of at least 10 (5) colony-forming units/ml urine, leukocyturia > 50/ micro l. exclusion criteria were underlying renal diseases, anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, age < 2 months and recurrent uti. results: patients presented with a mean rectal temperature of 38.6 +/- 1.3 degrees c, mean crp of 66 +/- 68 mg/dl, mean wbc 13 500 +/- 5 600/ micro  l and mean urinary leukocytes of 425 +/- 363/ micro l. in urine cultures e. coli  was found in 47 % of the cases, enterococcus faecalis 23 %, proteus mirabilis 8 %, klebsiella oxytoca 4 %, pseudomonas aeruginosa 5 % and others 13 %. in 76 % one and in 24 % two different bacterial species (60 % enterococcus faecalis) were cultured. mean resistance rates were in all bacteria (in e. coli): ampicillin 53  % (69 %), ampicillin and sulbactam 51 % (61 %), cefalosporin 1 (st) generation (cefaclor) 48 % (24 %), cefalosporin 2 (nd) generation (cefuroxim) 40 % (3 %), cefalosporin 3 (rd) generation (cefuroxim) 33 % (0 %), tobramycin 30 % (2 %), ciprofloxacine 0 %, cotrimoxazole 40 % (42 %), nitrofurantoin 12 % (0 %). conclusion: the resistance rates to ampicillin (+/- sulbactam) did not increase as compared to previous analyses (1990 - 1995), however, resistance rates to cotrimoxazole and 1 (st) generation cefalosporines increased about 20 %. we conclude that the policies for treatment of uti in children should be re-evaluated every 5 years according to local resistance rates.

TI  == cefotaximases (ctx-m-ases), an expanding family of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == among the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, the cefotaximases (ctx-m-ases) constitute a rapidly growing cluster of enzymes that have disseminated geographically. the ctx-m-ases, which hydrolyze cefotaxime efficiently, are mostly encoded by transferable plasmids, and the enzymes have been found predominantly in enterobacteriaceae, most prevalently in escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. isolates of vibrio cholerae, acinetobacter baumannii, and aeromonas hydrophila encoding ctx-m-ases have also been reported. the ctx-m-ases belong to the molecular class  a beta-lactamases, and the enzymes are functionally characterized as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. this group of beta-lactamases confers resistance to penicillins, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and monobactams, and the enzymes are inhibited by clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam. typically, the ctx-m-ases hydrolyze cefotaxime more efficiently than ceftazidime, which is reflected in substantially higher mics to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime. phylogenetically, the ctx-m-ases are divided into four subfamilies that seem to have descended from chromosomal beta-lactamases of kluyvera spp. insertion sequences, especially isecp1, have been found adjacent to genes encoding enzymes  of all four subfamilies. the class i integron-associated orf513 also seems to be  involved in the mobilization of blactx-m genes. this review discusses the phylogeny and the hydrolytic properties of the ctx-m-ases, as well as their geographic occurrence and mode of spread.

TI  == proteus mirabilis genes that contribute to pathogenesis of urinary tract infection: identification of 25 signature-tagged mutants attenuated at least 100-fold.
AB  == proteus mirabilis, a common cause of urinary tract infections (uti) in individuals with functional or structural abnormalities or with long-term catheterization, forms bladder and kidney stones as a consequence of urease-mediated urea hydrolysis. known virulence factors, besides urease, are hemolysin, fimbriae, metalloproteases, and flagella. in this study we utilized the cba mouse model of ascending uti to evaluate the colonization of mutants of p. mirabilis hi4320 that were generated by signature-tagged mutagenesis. by performing primary screening of 2088 p. mirabilis transposon mutants, we identified 502 mutants that ranged from slightly attenuated to unrecoverable. secondary screening of these mutants revealed that 114 transposon mutants were reproducibly attenuated. cochallenge of 84 of these single mutants with the parent strain in the mouse model resulted in identification of 37 consistently out-competed p. mirabilis transposon mutants, 25 of which were out-competed >100-fold for colonization of the bladder and/or kidneys by the parent strain. we determined the sequence flanking the site of transposon insertion in 29 attenuated mutants and identified genes affecting motility, iron acquisition, transcriptional regulation, phosphate transport, urease activity, cell surface structure, and key metabolic pathways as requirements for p. mirabilis infection  of the urinary tract. two mutations localized to a approximately 42-kb plasmid present in the parent strain, suggesting that the plasmid is important for colonization. isolation of disrupted genes encoding proteins with homologies to known bacterial virulence factors, especially the urease accessory protein uref and the disulfide formation protein dsba, showed that the cba mouse model and mutant pools are a reliable source of attenuated mutants with mutations in virulence genes.

TI  == mortality in murine peritonitis correlates with increased escherichia coli adherence to the intestinal mucosa.
AB  == during peritonitis, bacterial adherence is the initial step in a series of events that include mucosal infection, bacterial translocation, organ dysfunction, and death. adherent escherichia coli levels increase in response to stress. this study was designed to assess the adherence of e. coli to the cecal mucosa after cecal ligation and puncture (clp) of increasing severity and to determine whether a relationship exists between adherence of bacteria and mortality. sham surgery,  sterile peritonitis (thioglycollate administration), lethal clp (18-gauge double-puncture), and nonlethal clp (23-gauge single-puncture) were performed on  swiss webster mice and compared with normal mice or before clp (time 0). specimens of bowel tissue were harvested, and serial log dilutions of homogenized specimens or bowel contents were plated and cultured on media selective for determination of individual bacterial species. low levels of e. coli and proteus  mirabilis adhered to the mucosa of unmanipulated controls; however, adherence of  both species increased significantly by 18 hours after both lethal and nonlethal  clp. after 18 hours, adherent e. coli levels increased by greater than 5 x 10(6)-fold compared to unmanipulated controls, whereas p. mirabilis levels decreased. after nonlethal clp, adherent p. mirabilis increased 3 x 10(6)-fold compared to unmanipulated animals, whereas e. coli levels did not increase after  24 hours. sterile peritonitis had little effect on bacterial adherence. higher levels of adherent e. coli in the cecum correlate with the increased mortality observed after lethal clp. higher levels of adherent p. mirabilis appear to prevent the overgrowth of adherent e. coli following nonlethal clp. our data indicate that e. coli plays a key role in mortality from polymicrobial peritonitis and that proteus may be antagonistic to e. coli in murine peritonitis.

AB  == moxifloxacin is a recent fluoroquinolone with an antibacterial spectrum encompassing both aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive strains, as well as anaerobic bacteria. in this study the activity of moxifloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and effects of subinhibitory concentrations on bacterial morphology and adhesion properties were compared with those of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone. the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive and  gram-negative pathogens was equal to or better than that of comparators. subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin significantly affected bacterial morphology of s. pneumoniae, m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa, leading to formation of spherical forms and filaments. moreover, bacterial adhesion to buccal cells and fibroblasts was reduced after treatment with 1/4 and 1/8 x mic of moxifloxacin. in conclusion, subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin remarkably interfere with some bacterial pathogenic factors, thereby contributing to its antimicrobial activity.

AB  == it has been suggested that proteus infection may be involved in the pathogenesis  of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). bacterial and peptide immune responses in patients  with ra and other control subjects were investigated in two geographically different populations. serum samples from finnish patients with early ( n=72) and advanced ( n=27) ra and 30 finnish healthy controls, as well as from japanese ra  patients from two different locations: tokyo ( n=30) and otsu ( n=30), 18 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and 23 japanese healthy controls were all screened for the total, and class-specific (igg, iga and igm) antibodies against proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and serratia marcescens by indirect immunofluorescence assay. these samples were also tested for the determination of levels of isotypic antibodies against the shared epitope involving 16-mer synthetic peptides containing the eqrraa or essral sequences and compared to scrambled control peptide by using an enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay method.  significantly elevated levels of igg and igm antibodies to p. mirabilis and antibodies against both eqrraa and essral peptides were detected in sera of finnish patients with early and advanced ra, and in japanese patients from otsu or tokyo compared to their corresponding control groups. in contrast, no difference either in the total or in any of the isotypic antibodies were observed between these groups when serum samples were screened against each of e. coli and s. marcescens or against the control peptide. furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the antibody levels against proteus bacteria only and both eqrraa and esrral peptides. our findings support the possibility for specific involvement of p. mirabilis in the etiopathogenesis of ra even in early  cases.

AB  == in this retrospective investigation, we documented the bacterial colonization of  79 patients with chronic wounds, who had been treated between january 2002 and may 2003 in an outpatient wound healing clinic of a university dermatology program. we isolated 106 facultative pathogenic bacterial strains of which 56 were staphylococcus aureus, 19 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11 escherichia coli, 4 proteus mirabilis, 4 enterobacter cloacae, 2 serratia marcescens, 2 streptococcus group g und 8 further species. 68 of these bacterial strains were gram-positive and 46 gram-negative. moreover we identified one patient with candida parapsilosis. therefore, 70.8% of all patients showed staphylococcus aureus in their chronic wounds. determination of the specific resistances showed 17 patients to be colonized with oxacillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus (orsa) strain; this corresponds to 21.5% of all patients. consequently, 30.4% of all staphylococcus aureus isolates were orsa strains. all of the orsa isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. sensitivity to tetracycline was documented in 15, to amikacin in 13, to clindamycin in 7, to gentamicin and erythromycin in 6 of the orsa-positive patients. in the case of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 10 were sensitive and 3 were intermediate in sensitivity. beside the obligate resistance  to oxacillin, penicillin g, ampicillin, cefuroxime and imipenem, none of the orsa was sensitive to ofloxacin. the results of our investigations demonstrate the actual spectrum of bacterial colonization in chronic wounds of patients in an university dermatologic wound clinic and underline the growing problem of orsa.

TI  == the status of antimicrobial resistance in taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (tsar) program, 2000.
AB  == in a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (taiwan surveillance of  antimicrobial resistance, tsar), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers  and regional hospitals throughout taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (tsar  ii). this report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) in the tsar ii collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (tsar i) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. resistance of the 5 enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in e. coli, 68% in p. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in k. pneumonia to 66% in s. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in k.  pneumoniae to 70% in p. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in taiwan than most western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant a. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant e. coli (12%). differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in tsar ii; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout taiwan.

TI  == current issues in the management of urinary tract infections: extended-release ciprofloxacin as a novel treatment option.
AB  == symptomatic urinary tract infections (utis) are a major public health concern in  the developed world, accounting for almost 8 million annual outpatient and emergency department visits in the us alone, while also representing one of the most common hospital-acquired infections. the vast majority of uncomplicated utis are caused by the gram-negative bacillus escherichia coli, with other pathogens including enterococci, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella spp. and proteus  mirabilis. effective management of utis in both the inpatient and outpatient settings has been complicated by the fact that many uropathogenic strains have developed resistance to antimicrobials, including cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), the current first-line treatment for uncomplicated utis in the us and many other countries. in some countries, other antimicrobial therapies, such as trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin, are also used for treatment of uncomplicated utis. antimicrobial resistance has been associated with an increased rate of clinical failure, and reports from canada and the us indicate that the prevalence of cotrimoxazole resistance exceeds 15% and can be as high as 25%.the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance can be reduced with the use of agents that have favourable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and convenient dose administration regimens that facilitate patient adherence and, therefore, pathogen eradication.  fluoroquinolones have been used successfully to treat a wide range of community-  and hospital-acquired infections, and the rates of fluoroquinolone resistance have remained low. use of fluoroquinolones is recommended for uncomplicated utis  in areas where the incidence of cotrimoxazole resistance exceeds 10%, as well as  for the treatment of complicated utis and acute pyelonephritis. ciprofloxacin is  a widely used fluoroquinolone with high bactericidal activity against uropathogens and well established clinical efficacy in the treatment of utis. a new, extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin (cipro xr) provides systemic drug exposure comparable with that achieved with twice-daily administration of conventional, immediate-release ciprofloxacin, while also attaining higher maximum plasma concentrations with less interpatient variability. therapeutic drug concentrations with extended-release ciprofloxacin are established immediately after dose administration and maintained throughout the 24-hour dosage interval, permitting convenient, once-daily treatment. clinical trial results confirm that extended-release ciprofloxacin is as safely used and effective as the conventional, immediate-release formulation of ciprofloxacin in  patients with uncomplicated utis, complicated utis or acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis. these findings support the use of extended-release ciprofloxacin  as a well tolerated, effective and convenient therapy for utis, which may improve patients' adherence to therapy and, thereby, reduce the risk of infection recurrence and emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (cmz) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan was evaluated yearly for two years from june  2000 to march 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and flomoxef (fmox). in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002. in these surveillances spanning two years, the mic90s of cmz against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (mssa, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 73%-->87%), staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (other cns, 13%-->18%), escherichia coli (4%-->1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), morganella morganii (7%-->0%), providencia spp. (17%-->0%),  peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, s. epidermidis, other cns, and other bacteroides spp. tended to increase. in addition, the percent resistance of b. fragilis was 10%. it is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and superior to that of sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the  tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that  of fmox. against b. fragilis and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was  almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of  sbt/cpz and fmox. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before cmz was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity.

TI  == different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  == we examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (egcg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods. compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of egcg against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, and s. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher mics (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against gram-negative rods, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. and difference was observed between the binding abilities of egcg with viable s. aureus and with e. coli. the bactericidal activity of egcg for s. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide  or dextran. it was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of egcg. these results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different  affinities of egcg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the  different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to egcg.

TI  == longitudinal trends in fluoroquinolone resistance among enterobacteriaceae isolates from inpatients and outpatients, 1989-2000: differences in the emergence and epidemiology of resistance across organisms.
AB  == we conducted a 12-year study to identify and compare trends in annual prevalence  of fluoroquinolone (fq) resistance among enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from inpatients and outpatients in our health care system. a total of 46,070 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates underwent susceptibility testing. although there were significant increases in inpatient fq resistance for all enterobacteriaceae, fq resistance trends differed significantly across enterobacteriaceae (p<.001). for isolates obtained from outpatients, only escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis demonstrated significant increases in fq resistance (p<.001 for each). trends in outpatient fq resistance also differed significantly across enterobacteriaceae (p<.001). there were significant differences between inpatient and outpatient fq resistance trends for all enterobacteriaceae except p. mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae. although hospital-wide use of certain antibiotics correlated significantly with inpatient  fq resistance, these correlations differed substantially across organisms. efforts to elucidate the epidemiology of fq resistance and identify targets for intervention must recognize and account for the variability of fq resistance across organisms and clinical settings.

TI  == [catheter-related urinary infections at the clinical center in banja luka].
AB  == introduction: catheter-associated urinary tract infections are the most common nosocomial infections of the urinary tract, and among the most common nosocomial  infections in general. the major problems of these infections include antibiotic  resistance and enormous direct and indirect cost of treatment. material and methods: a retrospective study on major causes of infections and antibiotic resistance was conducted at four clinics of the clinical center of banja luka. an anonymous questionnaire was distributed to nursing staff dealing with urinary catheters in order to get an overview of their clinical performance. results: the results showed that in 89% of cases (out of 198 patients with developed catheter-associated urinary tract infection) infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria, in 7% by gram-positive bacteria and in 4% by candida. the most common bacteria were: escherichia coli (33.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.1%), proteus mirabilis (13.3%), and enterobacter (10.5%). majority of bacteria presented with extremely high resistance (72-100%) to ampicillin, gentamycin and cotrimoxazole, and in some cases a significant resistance to ciproflaxacine, nalidixic acid, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. the questionnaire showed that nursing staff did not follow guidelines for medical care of patients  with urinary catheters. conclusion: it can be concluded that poor hygienic and epidemiological conditions, as well as irrational use of antibiotics contribute to uncontrolled development of urinary tract infections in catheterized patients.

TI  == results from the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme: report of the 2001 data from 15 united states medical centres.
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme is an international surveillance network of more than 100 medical centres where meropenem is the primary therapeutic carbapenem. institutions have  been monitored since 1997 (1999 in united states (us)) using national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) reference susceptibility methods to monitor in vitro activity of meropenem and selected other broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. in 2001, a total of 2874 strains were processed from the 15 us medical centres. molecular methods were associated with mic methods as needed  for defining epidemic spread of resistant strains. the meropenem mic(90) values were 0.03 mg/l for citrobacter spp., escherichia coli and klebsiella spp.; 0.06 mg/l for proteus mirabilis and serratia spp. and 0.12 mg/l for enterobacter spp.  this potency was 8-16-fold greater than that of imipenem and the meropenem spectrum of activity versus the enterobacteriaceae was the broadest of all tested antimicrobial agents. only piperacillin/tazobactam (mic(9), 64 mg/l) and tobramycin (mic(90), 4 mg/l) were active against more than 90.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa at the nccls susceptible breakpoint, and the carbapenems were the most active compounds against acinetobacter spp. however, acinetobacter spp. isolates  were resistant to all of the antimicrobial agents tested and the molecular typing results suggested that they were epidemiologically related. only ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime had significantly reduced activity against oxacillin-susceptible  staphylococci (87.9-92.6% susceptible. these 2001 us mystic programme results demonstrated no significant decline in carbapenem activity or susceptibility rates compared with the previously monitored years (1999-2000). most apparent were the decreasing susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime against staphylococci. continued surveillance in these institutions appears warranted as sites of high potential emerging resistance risk.

TI  == cephalosporin resistant urinary tract infections in young children.
AB  == objective: to describe the antibiotic resistance pattern of bacteria causing urinary tract infection (uti) in a cohort of australian children under 6 years of age. methods: data were collected over a 12-month period from children under 6 years of age with a provisional diagnosis of uti made in the emergency department of sunshine hospital, victoria. results: during the study period 100 culture-proven uti were identified in 97 children. three children had two episodes. out of the 100 episodes, 39% were male, 56% were under 12 months of age at presentation and 61% were managed as outpatients. clinical features were non-specific in the majority of cases. hydronephrosis and vesicoureteric reflux was detected in 5.5% and 28.6%, respectively, of children with their first investigated uti. a single bacterial isolate was cultured from 97 urines and two  from three samples. escherichia coli (n = 90) and proteus mirabilis (n = 5) were  the most common isolates. in vitro resistance to ampicillin/amoxycillin was found in 52% of isolates, to trimethoprim in 14% and to cephalothin/cephalexin in 24%.  this resistance rate to first generation cephalosporins is the highest reported to date in adult or paediatric uti in australia. conclusions: ampicillin/amoxycillin or cephalothin/cephalexin may not be the optimal choice of antibiotic for the empiric treatment of uti in this and possibly other paediatric populations.

TI  == adaptation to extreme environments: macromolecular dynamics in bacteria compared  in vivo by neutron scattering.
AB  == mean macromolecular dynamics was quantified in vivo by neutron scattering in psychrophile, mesophile, thermophile and hyperthermophile bacteria. root mean square atomic fluctuation amplitudes determining macromolecular flexibility were  found to be similar for each organism at its physiological temperature ( approximately 1 a in the 0.1 ns timescale). effective force constants determining the mean macromolecular resilience were found to increase with physiological temperature from 0.2 n/m for the psychrophiles, which grow at 4 degrees c, to 0.6 n/m for the hyperthermophiles (85 degrees c), indicating that the increase in stabilization free energy is dominated by enthalpic rather than entropic terms. larger resilience allows macromolecular stability at high temperatures, while maintaining flexibility within acceptable limits for biological activity.

(b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == differential regulation of the proteus mirabilis urease gene cluster by urer and  h-ns.
AB  == proteus mirabilis, a cause of catheter-associated urinary tract infection, relies on several virulence factors to colonize the urinary tract. among these, urease contributes to the development of urinary stones resulting from the increase in local ph due to urease-mediated hydrolysis of urea to nh(3) and co(2). urer, an arac-like transcriptional activator, activates transcription of the genes encoding the urease subunits and accessory proteins (uredabcefg) in the presence  of urea. urer also initiates transcription of its own gene in a urea-inducible manner by binding to the intergenic region between urer and ured. the intergenic  region contains poly(a) tracts that appear to be the target of h-ns. it has been  shown that escherichia coli and p. mirabilis h-ns acts to repress transcription of urer in an e. coli model system. it was hypothesized that h-ns represses urease gene expression in the absence of urer and urea by binding to the intergenic region. to demonstrate this the p. mirabilis hns gene was cloned and the 15.6 kda h-ns was overexpressed and purified as a myc-his tail fusion. using  a gel shift assay, purified h-ns-myc-his bound preferentially to a 609 bp dna fragment containing the entire urer-ured intergenic region. h-ns and urer were able to displace each other from the urer-ured intergenic region. circular permutation analysis revealed that the intergenic region is bent. moreover, h-ns  recognizes this curvature, binds the dna fragment and induces further bending of  the dna as shown by a circular ligation assay. the effects of h-ns, urea and temperature (25 vs 37 degrees c) on urease expression were shown in e. coli containing an hns knockout and p. mirabilis where expression was increased at 37  degrees c. increased transcription from p(urer) was seen in the e. coli hns knockout when temperature was increased from 25 to 37 degrees c. these findings suggest h-ns and urer differentially regulate urease in a negative and positive manner, respectively.

TI  == [urinary tract infection in institutionalized elderly patients. incidence of bacterial resistance and risk factors].
AB  == introduction: the goal of the present work was to study urinary tract infections  (uti) in a sociosanitary center in order to characterize etiology, define sensitivity profiles, and study associations between these profiles and various clinical parameters. material and methods: a prospective study of all urinary tract infections at the caring unit of a geriatric sociosanitary center was carried out. antibiograms were performed on all patients in which a uti was suspected, and the association between the isolated organism or e. coli resistance with various clinical parameters (gender, bed confinement, recurrence, incontinence, neural impairment, basic daily life activities and drug use) was studied using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. results: escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis are the most commonly isolated organisms (51% and 15%, respectively). the former is associated with bed confinement and the female gender. the latter shows an inverse relation with recurrence in 90 days. resistance to the antibiotics studied correlates with a number of clinical parameters, although associations vary for each antimicrobial agent. previous use of antibiotics and recurrence of infection have no influence on resistance. discussion: geriatric patients' characteristics may well account for some of the  results encountered. however, the development of resistance in the center may be  related to spreading from direct contact between patients. the relationship between resistance and drug use may be affected by the external administration, rather than in-center administration, of drugs.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in community and private health care centers.
AB  == in 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the aquitaine region in france produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). among these were 19 enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 escherichia coli isolates; 3 proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and providencia stuartii. esbl producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes  and 5 ambulatory patients. seven different esbls were characterized. these mainly consisted of tem-24 (25 isolates) and tem-21 (9 isolates), but tem-15 (2 isolates) and tem-3, tem-19, shv-4, and ctx-m-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. seven strains showed the coexistence of different tem- and/or shv-encoding genes, including a new shv-1 variant, shv-44, defined by the substitution r205l previously reported for shv-3 in association with s238g. the epidemiology of the esbl producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic dna, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the esbl, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the esbl-encoding plasmids. of the tem-24-expressing strains, 18 were e. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in france. of the tem-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. the presence of esbl producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in general practice.

TI  == comparison of two test methods for the determination of sufficient antimicrobial  activity of three commonly used alcohol-based hand rubs for hygienic hand disinfection.
AB  == in europe, the antimicrobial efficacy of alcohol-based hand rubs is determined with a quantitative suspension test (pren 12054) and a test under practical conditions (en 1500). another test method has recently been published by the german society for hygiene and microbiology (dghm) with four differences to the european system in the in vitro tests: additional qualitative suspension tests with product dilutions to the ineffective range; a selection of the most resistant gram-negative test strains in the qualitative suspension test, which should be used adjacent to pseudomonas aeruginosa in the quantitative suspension  test; a high organic load in the quantitative suspension tests (0.3% albumin and  0.3% sheep erythrocytes); and an aqueous control in the quantitative suspension test. according to dghm, the in vitro tests should be followed by en 1500. we have determined the antimicrobial efficacy of three commonly used alcohol-based hand rubs according to both methods. pren 12054 was carried out without organic load. the qualitative suspension tests (dghm) were carried out with p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus hirae and candida albicans. the quantitative suspension test (dghm)  was carried out with product dilutions of 75%, 50% and 25%, and a high organic load using the following test organisms: p. aeruginosa, p. mirabilis (one product only), s. aureus, e. hirae and c. albicans. all these suspension tests were carried out in quadruplicate with each product and exposure time. en 1500 was carried out with 3 ml of each product and an application time of 30 s. all three  products achieved the required bactericidal activity of pren 12054 and the new dghm method within 30 s, and were equally effective with the reference hand disinfection of en 1500 within 30 s. in our study, the dghm test method did not provide additional information for hand rubs which exhibit their bactericidal efficacy with 3 ml within 30 s (en 1500).

TI  == susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  == the aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. we created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 january, 1990 through 31 december, 2000). improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and  to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. during the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). the mean annual number  of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). the 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: escherichia coli (1494), staphylococcus aureus (1240), klebsiella pneumoniae (779), enterococcus spp. (631), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (488), streptococcus pneumoniae (447), enterobacter spp. (338), acinetobacter spp. (298), proteus mirabilis (260) and candida spp. (254). no significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations)  per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was e. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was candida (1, 0.3). forty percent of organisms (n=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ed), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (icus). trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ed enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the icu isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. the difference in susceptibility between ed and icu isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (p<0.001). a significant decrease in the susceptibility of e coli  to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. in k. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of k. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all  traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. susceptibility of s. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (p<0.001). marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for detection of enterobacteriaceae in foods.
AB  == a broad-range pcr assay for the detection of bacteria belonging to the enterobacteriaceae family was developed in this study. primers targeting the bacterial 16s rrna gene were newly designed and used in this pcr assay. to determine the specificity of the assay, 72 different bacterial species (of 49 genera), 2 fungi, 3 animals, and 4 plants were tested. results were positive for  every tested vibrioaceae or enterobacteriaceae strain except proteus mirabilis. for all other bacterial strains and eukaryotes tested, results were negative. bacterial dna for pcr was prepared by a simple procedure with the use of chelex 100 resin from culture after growth in brain heart infusion medium. to test this  pcr assay for the monitoring of the enterobacteriaceae family, either escherichia coli or salmonella enteritidis was inoculated into various foods as an indicator. prior to the pcr, the inoculation of 10 to 40 cfu of bacteria per g of food was followed by a 5-h enrichment culture step, and the pcr assay allowed the detection of bacterial cells. when actual examinations of the contamination of 15 noodle foods with enterobacteriaceae by this pcr assay were conducted, 33% (5 of  15) of the samples tested positive. these results agreed with those of the petrifilm enterobacteriaceae count plate assay. including the enrichment culture  step, the entire pcr detection process can be completed within 7 h.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four european countries, canada, and the united states in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  == access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. the present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in europe (france, germany, italy, and spain), canada, and the united states to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. all but two isolates of enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of proteus mirabilis from france and one isolate of morganella morganii from canada) were susceptible to imipenem. the susceptibility of escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for p. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except italy. in contrast, susceptibility  of e. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (spain) to 94.0% (france); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (spain) to 91.6% (united states). among klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of serratia marcescens and m. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. for s. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (france) to 94.1% (italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (germany) to 90.7%  (spain). enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of enterobacteriaceae studied. the present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro  activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == the xerc recombinase of proteus mirabilis: characterization and interaction with  other tyrosine recombinases.
AB  == xerc and xerd are two site-specific recombinases, which act on different sites to maintain replicons in a monomeric state. this system, which was first discovered  and studied in escherichia coli, is present in several species including proteus  mirabilis, where the xerd recombinase was previously characterized by our laboratory. in this paper, we report the presence of the xerc gene in p. mirabilis. using in vitro reactions, we show that the two p. mirabilis recombinases display binding and cleavage activity on the e. coli dif site and the cole1 cer site, together or in collaboration with e. coli recombinases. in vivo, p. mirabilis xerc and xerd are able to resolve and monomerize a plasmid containing two cer sites, increasing its stability. however, p. mirabilis xerc, in combination with e. coli xerd, is unable to perform these functions.

TI  == trends in fluoroquinolone resistance of bacteria isolated from canine urinary tracts.
AB  == fluoroquinolone (fq) antimicrobial agents are used extensively in human and veterinary medicine. widespread use of any antimicrobial agent can apply selective pressure on populations of bacteria, which may result in an increase in the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant isolates. antimicrobial-susceptibility  data on bacteria isolated from the canine urinary tract by the university of missouri-columbia veterinary medical diagnostic laboratory, columbia, mo, were used to determine whether there has been an increase in the prevalence of fq-resistant bacteria over time. between january 1992 and december 2001, minimum  inhibitory concentrations of either ciprofloxacin (1992-1998) or enrofloxacin (1998-2001) were determined for 1,478 bacterial isolates from the canine urinary  tract. the predominant bacterial species isolated were escherichia coli (547 isolates), proteus mirabilis (156), and staphylococcus intermedius (147). in all, there were 13 bacterial species with more than 25 isolates each. a significant increase in the overall proportion of resistant bacterial isolates was documented from 1992 to 2001 (cochran-armitage test for trend, p < 0.0001). the same increase in resistant isolates was documented when either ciprofloxacin or enrofloxacin was analyzed separately (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0002, respectively). no difference was detected in rates of bacterial fq resistance with regard to the sex of the dog from which the bacteria were isolated. the frequency with which some bacterial species were isolated differed with the sex of the infected dog. proteus mirabilis was found more often in females (p < 0.0001), whereas beta hemolytic streptococcus spp., were found more often in males (p = 0.0003). although the overall efficacy of fq antimicrobials remained high with greater than 80% of isolates being susceptible, the data demonstrated an increase in the  proportion of resistant bacteria isolated from the urinary tract of the dog.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == enhanced microbial biomass assay using mutant luciferase resistant to benzalkonium chloride.
AB  == in a biomass assay based on adenosine 5(')-triphosphate (atp) bioluminescence, extracellular atp is removed; then intracellular atp is extracted from the microorganism by an atp extractant and subsequently reacted with luciferase. to provide a highly sensitive assay, the concentration of benzalkonium chloride (bac) in the atp extractant was optimized by using a mutant luciferase resistant  to bac. the use of 0.2% bac, which was acceptable for the luciferase, simultaneously achieved the maximum extraction of intracellular atp from microorganisms and the inactivation of the atp-eliminating enzymes for removal of extracellular atp. the detection limit (blank+3 sd) for atp was 1.8x10(-14)m (1.8x10(-18)mol/assay) in the presence of the atp extractant with coefficients of variation of 0.7 to 6.3%. the reagent system coupled with the atp-eliminating enzymes allowed for the detection of 93 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of escherichia coli atcc 25922, 170cfu/ml of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, 170cfu/ml of proteus mirabilis atcc 29906, 68cfu/ml of staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, and 7.7cfu/ml of bacillus subtilis atcc 6051. the yeast cell of saccharomyces cerevisiae ifo 10217 could be detected at 1cfu/ml. with 54 kinds of microorganisms, the average atp extraction efficiency compared to the trichloroacetic acid extraction method was 81.0% in 24 strains among gram-negative bacteria, 99.4% in 13 strains among gram-positive bacteria, and 97.0% in 17 strains among yeast. the atp contents of the gram-negative bacteria,  gram-positive bacteria, and yeasts ranged from 0.40 to 2.70x10(-18)mol/cfu (mean=1.5x10(-18)mol/cfu), from 0.41 to 16.7x10(-18)mol/cfu (mean=5.5x10(-18)mol/cfu), and from 0.714 to 54.6x10(-16)mol/cfu (mean=8.00x10(-16)mol/cfu), respectively.

TI  == ampc beta-lactamase producing multidrug resistant strains of klebsiella spp. & escherichia coli isolated from children under five in chennai.
AB  == background & objectives: ampc beta-lactamases are group i cephalosporinases that  confer resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactam drugs. plasmid mediated ampc beta-lactamases has been discovered most frequently in isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, salmonella, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. the present study was undertaken to study the occurrence of multidrug resistant and ampc beta-lactamase producing klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli in children less than five years of age as this age group is very susceptible to intestinal and extraintestinal infections. methods: a total of 116 isolates of klebsiella species and 32 isolates of esch. coli were tested for resistance to cephamycin such as cefoxitin, third generation cephalosporin (3gc) antibiotics (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), ampicillin, amikacin, cephaloridine, cefuroxime, co-trimoxazole, gentamycin, imipenem and tetracycline by disc diffusion method. isolates found resistant to cefoxitin were tested for the production of ampc beta-lactamases by three dimensional extract method. transconjugation experiments were done to study the transfer of drug resistance and ampc beta lactamase production from ampc producing klebsiella and esch. coli isolates to a recipient  esch. coli strain (k12 j62-2). results: twenty eight isolates (24.1%) of klebsiella spp. and 12 (37.5%) of esch. coli were found to be ampc beta-lactamase producers; 66.6 per cent and 81 per cent of klebsiella and esch. coli isolates respectively showed resistance to all the 3gcs. all the strains were found to be  sensitive to imipenem. eighty four (72%) of klebsiella isolates and 20 (62.5%) of esch. coli were found to be resistant to cefoxitin. transfer of cefoxitin resistance to the recipient strain was observed in all the ampc producing strains of klebsiella spp. of the 12 ampc producing strains of esch. coli, only 4 (33.3%) showed the transfer of cefoxitin resistance to the recipient strain. interpretation & conclusion: this study has shown the occurrence of ampc beta-lactamase producing klebsiella and esch. coli strains in children in chennai. since ampc beta-lactamase production is frequently accompanied by multiresistance to antibiotics, therapeutic options become limited resulting a need for new measures for the management of klebsiella and esch. coli infections. also failure to identify ampc beta-lactamase producers may lead to inappropriate  antimicrobial treatment and may result in increased mortality. detecting plasmid  mediated ampc beta-lactamase producing strains is technically difficult and the phenotypic tests for ampc detection are not well defined. if an investigational ampc beta-lactamase inhibitor was made available for diagnostic testing, it could be useful in combination with a suitable cephamycin to confirm ampc production.

TI  == the influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome.  methods: from june 1995 to january 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant icu-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. we defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to  evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the  spss package (9.0). results: among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. in this last  group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. eleven percent developed  septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment.  the main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%),  respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). the microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and candida species (4.5% each). the frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (or 2.62; 95% ci: 1.10-6.21;  p = 0.015). the global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. the only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (p = 0.04; or = 0.35; 95% ci: 0.12-0.97). septic shock was related to attributable mortality (p = 0.03; or = 3.19; 95% ci: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (p = 0.24; or =  1.71; 95% ci: 0.66-4.78). conclusion: almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. this fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently  isolated and the source of the bacteremia.

TI  == in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
AB  == piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive,  clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised  disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp.,  but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance patterns among urine isolates from patients in a geriatric hospital and from older patients in a general hospital in jerusalem.
AB  == introduction and rationale: urinary tract infection is the most common cause of nosocomial infections in patients hospitalized in chronic care facilities. the changing spectrum of microorganisms involved in urinary tract infections and the  emerging resistance require continuous monitoring to provide crucial information  to guide empirical therapy and encourage prudent use of antibiotics. the aim of this survey was to assess the antimicrobial resistance profile of urine isolates  from patients hospitalized in a geriatric hospital and from elderly patients hospitalized in an acute care hospital in order to guide empirical therapy of urinary tract infections. methods: the survey was performed in two hospitals in jerusalem: a university-affiliated geriatric hospital- herzog -and an acute secondary- and tertiary-care university hospital- hadassah. we performed a retrospective analysis of antimicrobial resistance of all positive urine cultures obtained from patients in the geriatric division of herzog hospital and from patients aged 65 years and older hospitalized in the internal medicine departments in hadassah hospital during a 1-year period. results: the most common bacteria isolated from urine specimens in herzog hospital were, in order of frequency, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we demonstrated a high rate of antimicrobial resistance of those bacteria in both hospitals. the pattern we observed necessitates recommending ceftazidime as the most appropriate empirical therapy for urinary tract infection in herzog hospital. in hadassah hospital we recommend cefuroxime for those patients in good general condition and ceftazidime for those who present with clinical sepsis. antimicrobial resistance patterns should be assessed periodically and recommendations modified accordingly. infection control guidelines should be implemented in order to try to decrease the rate of antimicrobial resistance. further research is requested to assess the efficacy of such interventions in long-term care facilities.

TI  == bioactivity of secoiridoid glycosides from centaurium erythraea.
AB  == as part of our on-going search for bioactive compounds from scottish plants, two  secoiridoid glycosides, swertiamarin and sweroside, have been isolated from the aerial parts of centaurium erythraea rafn (family: gentianaceae) by reversed-phase preparative hplc coupled with a photo-diode-array detector. the structures of these compounds were elucidated unambiguously by uv, fabms and extensive 1d and 2d nmr spectroscopic analyses and also by comparing experimental data with literature data. antibacterial, free radical scavenging activities and  general toxicity of these glycosides have been assessed. both compounds inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli. while swertiamarin was also active against proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens, sweroside inhibited the growth of staphylococcus epidermidis. swertiamarin and sweroside exhibited significant general toxicity in brine shrimp lethality bioassay and the ld50 values were 8.0 microg/ml and 34 microg/ml, respectively, whereas that of the positive control podophyllotoxin, a  well known cytotoxic lignan, was 2.79 microg/ml. chemotaxonomic implications of these compounds in the family gentianaceae have also been discussed briefly.

TI  == pharmacological profile of extracts of pelargonium sidoides and their constituents.
AB  == in areas of southern africa, aqueous extracts from the roots of pelargonium sidoides are employed to cure various disorders. nowadays, a modern formulation (eps 7630), elaborated from the traditional herbal medicine, is successfully used for the treatment of respiratory tract diseases. we previously observed that root extracts of p. sidoides and their representative constituents exhibit moderate antibacterial and significant immunomodulatory capabilities. the present study was performed to further assess the efficacy and mode of action for these pharmacological activities. the results indicate that p. sidoides extracts may well possess antimycobacterial activity as claimed in traditional uses. furthermore, significant antibacterial properties against multi-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains as well as tnf-inducing potencies and prominent interferon-like activities in supernatants of sample-activated bone marrow-derived macrophages were observed using several functional assays. in addition, eps 7630 stimulated the synthesis of ifn-beta in mg 63 cells as demonstrated by a specific enzyme immunoassay. for gallic acid, a characteristic  constituent, evidence for the expression of inos and tnf-alpha transcripts in stimulated raw 264.7 cells and, hence, activation at the transcriptional level was revealed by rt-pcr. the present results, when taken together with the recently reported pharmacological activities, provide for a rationale basis of the utilization of eps 7630 in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

AB  == this retrospective study examined the characteristics of 338 pediatric patients presenting with a first episode of symptomatic urinary tract infection at taichung veterans general hospital from november 1996 to december 2001. escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (72.5%), followed by proteus mirabilis (8.3%), enterococcus (5.6%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (4.7%). they were more susceptible to first-generation cephalosporin in comparison with other  first-line antimicrobial agents such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and gentamicin. two hundred and eighty-seven (84.9%) of the 338 patients were divided into 3 groups according to the type of antibiotic treatment received, and the susceptibility rate and the averaged day of defervescence after effective antibiotic therapy were compared among the groups. group 1 consisted of those patients treated with cefazolin or cephalexin alone (95%, 2.1 days); group  2, cefazolin plus gentamicin (88.9%, 2.8 days); and group 3, ampicillin plus gentamicin (76.1%, 2.3 days). a total of 38 (13.2%) cases from the 3 antibiotic groups did not respond to empiric antibiotics. for non-susceptible infections, when the antibiotic regimen was switched from cefazolin plus gentamicin to ampicillin alone, only 4 (20%) strains became susceptible, compared with 10 strains (62.5%) becoming susceptible after switching from ampicillin plus gentamicin to cefazolin alone (p < 0.01). the results indicated that first-generation cephalosporin alone is an appropriate treatment for pediatric cases of community-acquired urinary tract infection and suggest that antimicrobial combinations should be reserved for serious or critical cases.

AB  == background: combination antimicrobial therapy is often necessary to eradicate infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. methods: to evaluate the potential benefit of aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combination therapy, the activity of aztreonam in combination with ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin was assessed using checkerboard testing for four clinical isolates of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, burkholderia cepacia and pseudomanas aeruginosa. results: all aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations demonstrated additive activity [fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) index >0.5-4] or synergy (fic index <or=0.5) for all 24 isolates tested. aztreonam plus ciprofloxacin was the most effective combination, demonstrating synergy against 16.7% of isolates (2 p. mirabilis, 1 e. cloacae, 1 b. cepacia). aztreonam in combination with moxifloxacin was synergistic against 2 isolates (p. mirabilis, e. cloacae), and in combination with gatifloxacin against 1 isolate (e. cloacae). aztreonam and levofloxacin demonstrated only additive activity. conclusion: additive activity was observed for the majority of the aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations tested against six species of gram-negative bacilli. synergy involving aztreonam  and fluoroquinolone combinations was less common than additive activity and was isolate dependent. although in vivo clinical successes have been documented using aztreonam in combination with other agents, confirmation by laboratory techniques requires further investigation.

TI  == trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities among enterobacteriaceae isolated from hospitalized patients in the united states from 1998 to 2001.
AB  == longitudinal surveillance of enterobacteriaceae for antimicrobial susceptibility  is important because species of this family are among the most significant and prevalent human pathogens. to estimate rates of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility among hospitalized patients in the united states, data from the surveillance network were studied for 14 agents tested against 10 species of enterobacteriaceae (n = 384,279) isolated from intensive-care-unit (icu) patients and non-icu inpatients from 1998 to 2001. cumulative susceptibility (percent) data for all species of enterobacteriaceae isolated from icu patients and non-icu inpatients, respectively, were ranked as follows: ampicillin-sulbactam (45.5 and  57.2) << ticarcillin-clavulanate (74.8 and 83.5) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (87.0 and 84.5) congruent with cefotaxime (82.9 and 92.6) = ceftazidime (82.3 and 91.0) = ceftriaxone (86.5 and 93.9) = piperacillin-tazobactam (83.5 and 90.5) < levofloxacin (89.3 and 90.6) = ciprofloxacin (91.0 and 91.7) < gentamicin (91.8 and 94.3) < cefepime (95.0 and 97.9) < amikacin (98.5 and 99.2) < imipenem (100 and 100) = meropenem (100 and 100). of those agents studied only susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin (94 to 89%) and levofloxacin (93 to 89%) decreased in a stepwise manner from 1998 to 2001. decreased fluoroquinolone susceptibility was most pronounced for escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae. for all species of enterobacteriaceae, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance was more commonly observed in isolates with a single-drug resistance phenotype while  gentamicin and fluoroquinolone resistances were more common in isolates resistant to at least one additional class of antimicrobial agent. ongoing surveillance of  enterobacteriaceae will be particularly important to monitor changes in fluoroquinolone susceptibility, as well as changes in the prevalence of isolates  resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == bacteriology of burns at the queen elizabeth central hospital, blantyre, malawi.
AB  == a retrospective study to determine the bacterial profile and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of burn isolates at the queen elizabeth central hospital (qech), blantyre, malawi was undertaken. while a total of 1825 burn patients were admitted to the hospital over a 6-year period (january 1994 to december 1999) only 317 (17.4%) specimens selected from as many patients were processed. one hundred and seventy (170/53.6%) specimens yielded single while the rest (147/46.4%) had multiple isolates giving a total of 535 bacterial isolates. of this number, 236 (44.1%) were gram-negatives and 299 (55.9%), gram-positives. among the gram-negatives, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, coliforms/escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common accounting for 94.1% while in the gram-positive group, staphylococcal and streptococcal spp. predominated (100%). however, the three most common isolates were staphylococcus aureus (37.6%), p. aeruginosa (22.4%) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (13.6%). while s. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were most  susceptible to penicillin (33.3 and 64.4% susceptibility, respectively), gentamycin appeared most effective against p. aeruginosa (53.3%). a general broad-spectrum resistance to panels of antibiotics used in the study was however  observed among the bacterial isolates. from these results, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, streptococcal spp., p. mirabilis, coliforms and k. pneumoniae representing 96.4% of all isolates were the most common in the burns unit.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == a uk multicentre study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == objectives: to determine the prevalence of resistance amongst urinary tract pathogens against antimicrobials used to treat urinary tract infections (utis) in the uk to provide data to help direct empirical therapy. method: during 1999-2000, a total of 1291 bacterial isolates causing uti were collected from 8 centres in the uk. isolates were cultured from patients with (1). community-acquired uti in those less than 65 years old (397), (2). hospital-acquired uti other than those admitted with pyelonephritis (394), (3). pyelonephritis (108) and (4). community-acquired uti in those greater than 65 years old (392). after re-identification, mics for a range of antimicrobials were determined and interpreted using nccls procedures and interpretive guidelines. results: escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen in all categories but the  total percentage for each category varied (56.3-77.3%). the next three pathogens  of importance were enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis which varied in prevalence slightly from category to category. the activity of amoxycillin against e. coli (51.3% susceptible) was greatly reduced as a result of beta-lactamase production and only partially restored by the addition of clavulanic acid (78.8% susceptible). cefuroxime was very active against e. coli using parenteral form breakpoints (97.1% susceptible) but less so using oral form breakpoints (68.6% susceptible). cefuroxime was inactive against  enterococcus spp. and pseudomonas spp. nitrofurantoin was very active against isolates of e. coli (96.3% susceptible) and e. faecalis but not against k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa. overall susceptibility to trimethoprim ranged from 58.1% to 84.5% for the most prevalent pathogens. ciprofloxacin was highly active against the uti pathogens examined in this study  with susceptibilities of between 88.6% and 97.7% for the most prevalent pathogens (e. coli, n=864, 97.7% susceptible) and was the only oral agent tested with activity against pseudomonas spp. conclusion: these data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance amongst pathogens currently causing uti in the uk.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == the etiology of urinary tract infection: traditional and emerging pathogens.
AB  == the microbial etiology of urinary infections has been regarded as well established and reasonably consistent. escherichia coli remains the predominant uropathogen (80%) isolated in acute community-acquired uncomplicated infections,  followed by staphylococcus saprophyticus (10% to 15%). klebsiella, enterobacter,  and proteus species, and enterococci infrequently cause uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis. the pathogens traditionally associated with uti are changing  many of their features, particularly because of antimicrobial resistance. the etiology of uti is also affected by underlying host factors that complicate uti,  such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, or catheterization. consequently, complicated uti has a more diverse etiology than uncomplicated uti, and organisms that rarely cause disease in healthy patients can cause significant disease in hosts with anatomic, metabolic, or immunologic underlying disease. the majority of community-acquired symptomatic utis in elderly women are caused by e coli. however, gram-positive organisms are common, and polymicrobial infections account for up to 1 in 3 infections in the elderly. in comparison, the most common organisms isolated in children with uncomplicated uti are enterobacteriaceae. etiologic pathogens associated with uti among patients with diabetes include klebsiella spp., group b streptococci, and enterococcus spp., as well as e coli.  patients with spinal cord injuries commonly have e coli infections. other common  uropathogens include pseudomonas and proteus mirabilis.recent advances in molecular biology may facilitate the identification of new etiologic agents for uti. the need for accurate and updated population surveillance data is apparent,  particularly in light of concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance. this information will directly affect selection of empiric therapy for uti.

TI  == acrab multidrug efflux pump is associated with reduced levels of susceptibility to tigecycline (gar-936) in proteus mirabilis.
AB  == tigecycline has good broad-spectrum activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens with the notable exception of the proteeae: a study was performed to identify the mechanism responsible for the reduced susceptibility to tigecycline in proteus mirabilis. two independent transposon insertion mutants of p. mirabilis that had 16-fold-increased susceptibility to tigecycline were mapped to the acrb gene homolog of the escherichia coli acrrab efflux system. wild-type  levels of decreased susceptibility to tigecycline were restored to the insertion  mutants by complementation with a clone containing a pcr-derived fragment from the parental wild-type acrrab efflux gene cluster. the acrab transport system appears to be associated with the intrinsic reduced susceptibility to tigecycline in p. mirabilis.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == integration of a transposon tn1-encoded inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamase gene,  bla(tem-67) from proteus mirabilis, into the escherichia coli chromosome.
AB  == proteus mirabilis nel-1 was isolated from a urine sample of a patient hospitalized in a long-term care facility. strain nel-1 produced a beta-lactamase with a pi of 5.2 conferring resistance to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid. sequencing of a pcr amplicon by using tem-specific primers revealed a novel bla(tem) gene, bla(tem-67). tem-67 was an irt-1-like tem derivative related to tem-65 (lys39, cys244) with an additional leu21ile amino acid substitution in the leader peptide. the biochemical properties of tem-67 were equivalent to those described for tem-65. analysis of sequences surrounding bla(tem-67) revealed that it was located on a transposon, tn1, which itself was located on a 48-kb non-self-transferable plasmid, pang-1. electroporation of plasmid pang-1 into escherichia coli dh10b resulted in the integration of bla(tem-67) into the chromosome, whereas it remained episomal in the p. mirabilis cip103181 reference  strain. further characterization of pang-1 revealed the presence of two identical sequences on both sides of tn1 that contained an is26 insertion sequence followed by a novel colicin gene, colz, which had 20% amino acid identity with other colicin genes. the characterization of this novel tem derivative provides further evidence for the large diversity of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases produced in p. mirabilis and for their spread to other enterobacterial species through transposable-element-mediated events.

TI  == [amyloidosis associated with chronic granulomatous disease in a patient with a renal transplant and recurrent urinary tract infections].
AB  == chronic granulomatous disease is a group of syndromes which share a defect in a component of the phagocyte nadph-oxidase complex. without this enzyme activity, phagocytic cells cannot produce superoxide, peroxide, and other potent microbicidal radicals, and are less able to kill ingested pathogens. the clinical picture is characterised by recurrent life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and abnormal tissue granuloma formation. on the other hand, amyloidosis is a systemic disease with renal involvement occurring in the majority of cases. recurrent amyloidosis is a rare but well documented event in renal transplant recipients. however, graft loss secondary to amyloidosis has been noted infrequently. in addition, de novo amyloidosis has not been previously associated with graft loss. we report here a renal transplant recipient with chronic granulomatous disease and history of recurrent urinary tract infections,  who developed nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal insufficiency secondary to de novo aa amyloidosis leading to graft loss 66 months after transplantation.

AB  == background: necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum is a fulminant, life-threatening condition. this infection is usually polymicrobial and may be idiopathic or secondary to local trauma or surgery. histologically, it is characterized by obliterative endarteritis and thrombosis of the subcutaneous vessels, fascial necrosis, and leukocytic infiltration. mortality rates of 25-75% have been reported. most cases of necrotizing gangrene begin insidiously, with scrotal discomfort and malaise. later, erythema, increasing pain, and swelling, associated with fever and chills, develop. a biopsy is useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to obtain culture samples. ultrasound imaging may reveal gas or testicular involvement and may help to distinguish this infection from other causes of scrotal pathology. materials and methods: fifteen patients with necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum, seen at the dermatology and plastic surgery sections of our institutions between 1994 and 1999, are described. results: this series included 11 men (73%) and four women (27%), aged  39-68 years (mean, 51 years). in our series, clostridium perfingens, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus viridans, acinetobacter baumani, escherichia coli, and candida albicans were isolated. hemodynamic stabilization and monitoring were performed in all patients. intravenous antimicrobial therapy was promptly instituted. in most cases, two or more drugs were used. concurrent surgical debridement of all necrotic areas was always required. when needed, split-thickness skin grafts were used to cover the penile shaft. expanded mesh grafts were used to reconstruct the vulva and other denuded beds. the survival rate in this series was 87%. conclusions: necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum continues to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. the usual polymicrobial infection with vascular involvement demands hemodynamic stabilization, systemic antimicrobial therapy, and surgical debridement. in some patients, genital, perineal, and abdominal wall reconstruction is also required.

TI  == role of rsma in the regulation of swarming motility and virulence factor expression in proteus mirabilis.
AB  == swarming by proteus mirabilis involves differentiation of typical short vegetative rods into filamentous hyper-flagellated swarm cells that undergo cycles of rapid and co-ordinated population migration across surfaces and exhibit high levels of virulence gene expression. rsma (repressor of secondary metabolites) and csra, its homologue in escherichia coli, control many phenotypic traits, such as motility and pathogenesis in erwinia species, glycogen biosynthesis, cell size and biofilm formation in escherichia coli and swarming motility in serratia marcescens. to investigate the role of rsma in proteus mirabilis, the rsma gene from proteus mirabilis (hereafter referred to as rsma(pm)) was cloned. rsma(pm) showed high sequence similarity to escherichia coli csra and rsma cloned from erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae and bacillus subtilis and could complement an  escherichia coli csra mutant in glycogen synthesis. a low-copy-number plasmid carrying rsma(pm) expressed from its native promoter caused suppression of swarming motility and expression of virulence factors in proteus mirabilis. mrna  stability assays suggested that rsma(pm) inhibited virulence factor expression through promoting mrna degradation. rsma homologues cloned from serratia marcescens and erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora could also inhibit swarming and virulence factor expression in proteus mirabilis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils isolated from portuguese endemic species of thymus.
AB  == aims: thymus species are wild species mostly found in the arid lands of portugal. possible antimicrobial properties of thymus essential oils have been investigated. the chemical composition of the essential oils and the antimicrobial activity of thymus mastichina (l) l. subsp. mastichina, t. camphoratus and t. lotocephalus from different regions of portugal were analysed. methods and results: hydrodistillation was used to isolate the essential oils and the chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography (gc) and gc coupled to mass spectrometry. the antimicrobial activity was tested by the disc agar diffusion technique against candida albicans, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp. and staphylococcus aureus. pure linalool, 1,8-cineole and a mixture (1 : 1) of these compounds were included. linalool, 1,8-cineole or linalool/1,8-cineole and linalool/1,8-cineole/linalyl acetate were the major components of the essential oils, depending on the species or sampling place. the essential oils isolated from the thymus species studied demonstrated antimicrobial activity but the micro-organisms tested had significantly different sensitivities. conclusions: the antimicrobial activity of essential oils may be related to more than one component. significance and impact of the study: portuguese endemic species of thymus can be used for essential oil  production for food spoilage control, cosmetics and pharmaceutical use. further studies will be required to elucidate the cell targets of the essential oil components.

TI  == epidemiology of bloodstream infection in nursing home residents: evaluation in a  large cohort from multiple homes.
AB  == this study sought to reevaluate the epidemiology of bloodstream infection in nursing home residents. the records of 166 nursing home residents admitted to an  urban, public, university-affiliated hospital with 169 episodes of bloodstream infection between january 1997 and april 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. the  most common organisms isolated were escherichia coli (27% of isolates), staphylococcus aureus (18%; 29% were methicillin-resistant strains), and proteus  mirabilis (13%). there was minimal resistance to quinolones and third-generation  cephalosporins among aerobic gram-negative bacilli. the most common sources were  the urinary tract (51% of episodes) and the lungs (11%); a source was not identified in 22% of episodes. hospital mortality was 18%. independent predictors of hospital mortality were a pulmonary source of infection, systolic blood pressure <90 mm hg, and leukocytosis >20,000 cells/mm3. compared with other studies published in the past 2 decades, mortality was lower. the most common resistant organism was methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == first occurrence of transferable extended-spectrum beta-lactamase hydrolyzing cefoperazone in multiresistant nosocomial strains of klebsiella pneumoniae from two hospitals in czech and slovak republics.
AB  == the occurrence of positive synergy between antibiotic discs of amoxicillin/clavulanate and cefoperazone was registered in two klebsiella pneumoniae strains, isolated from hospitals in czech and slovak republic, indicating the presence of genes coding for an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase active also against cefoperazone, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. sulbactam inhibited the hydrolysis of cefoperazone by cell-free lysates of these strains which substantiates its use in combination with cefoperazone. resistance to cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime and aztreonam was transferred from k. pneumoniae isolates to escherichia coli k-12 3110 and to proteus mirabilis p-38 recipient strains.

TI  == the helicobacter pylori flba flagellar biosynthesis and regulatory gene is required for motility and virulence and modulates urease of h. pylori and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == helicobacter pylori and proteus mirabilis ureases are nickel-requiring metallo-enzymes that hydrolyse urea to nh3 and co2. in both h. pylori and in an escherichia coli model of h. pylori urease activity, a high affinity nickel transporter, nixa, is required for optimal urease activity, whereas the urea-dependent urer positive transcriptional activator governs optimal urease expression in p. mirabilis. the h. pylori flba gene is a flagellar biosynthesis and regulatory gene that modulates urease activity in the e. coli model of h. pylori urease activity. all flba mutants of eight strains of h. pylori were non-motile and five had a strain-dependent alteration in urease activity. the flba gene decreased urease activity 15-fold when expressed in e. coli containing  the h. pylori urease locus and the nixa gene; this was reversed by disruption of  flba. the flba gene decreased nixa transcription. flba also decreased urease activity three-fold in e. coli containing the p. mirabilis urease locus in a urea- and urer-dependent fashion. here the flba gene repressed the p. mirabilis urease promoter. thus, flba decreased urease activity of both h. pylori and p. mirabilis, but through distinct mechanisms. h. pylori wild-type strain ss1 colonised gerbils at a mean of 5.4 x 10(6) cfu/g of antrum and caused chronic gastritis and lesions in the antrum. in contrast, the flba mutant did not colonise five of six gerbils and caused no lesions, indicating that motility mediated by flba was required for colonisation. because flba regulates flagellar  biosynthesis and secretion, as well as forming a structural component of the flagellar secretion apparatus, two seemingly unrelated virulence attributes, motility and urease, may be coupled in h. pylori and p. mirabilis and possibly also in other motile, ureolytic bacteria.

AB  == among 730 escherichia coli, 438 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 141 proteus mirabilis  isolates obtained between september 2000 and september 2001 in seven hospitals in ho chi minh city, vietnam, 26.6% were resistant to ceftazidime, 30% were resistant to cefotaxime, 31.5% were resistant to ceftriaxone, 15.9% were resistant to cefoperazone, and 6% were resistant to cefepime. resistance to imipenem was found in 5.6% of the isolates. in 55 strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (32 e. coli isolates, 13 k. pneumoniae isolates, and 10 p. mirabilis isolates), structural genes for veb-1 (25.5%), ctx-m (25.5%), shv (38.1%), and tem (76.3%) enzymes were detected alone or in combination. sequencing of the pcr products obtained from the k. pneumoniae isolates revealed the presence of bla(veb-1), bla(ctx-m-14), bla(ctx-m-17), bla(shv-2), and bla(tem-1). molecular typing of the strains with a similar resistance phenotype to broad-spectrum cephalosporins indicated polyclonal spread. isecp1 was presumably responsible for dissemination of the bla(ctx-m-like) gene.

TI  == serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.
AB  == background: controversy exists regarding the appropriate prophylactic dose of cefazolin for coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) because the effect of cpb on serum drug levels is poorly understood. current standards of prophylaxis are based primarily on empiric studies. few studies have attempted to quantify serum cefazolin levels in either cardiac or noncardiac surgeries. this study was conducted to measure and assess the adequacy of the intraoperative serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin  in cpb surgery. methods: this prospective study serially measured six intraoperative serum cefazolin levels in 10 subjects undergoing elective and urgent cabg surgery. we compared the serum levels with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic90) for the most common organisms causing postoperative infection. results: serum-free cefazolin levels fluctuated considerably during the operation but remained above the mic90, for staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. the serum levels fell below the mic90 for enterobacter, serratia, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis. conclusions: serum cefazolin levels during cpb remained consistently above the mic for two of the three main organisms causing postoperative infection but were suboptimal for the remainder.  additional studies are needed to assess the intraoperative serum levels of single-dose cefazolin prophylaxis and to explore alternate dosing methods that minimize intraoperative fluctuations in serum cefazolin levels.

TI  == is there a need for postoperative surveillance after day case groin surgery in children?
AB  == there is increasing awareness of the value of day case paediatric surgery in fulfilling the needs of the community. is this cost effective, are there hidden complications and is there a need for routine follow-up? seven hundred and thirty-one children attending the red cross war memorial children's hospital day  surgery unit over a 32-month period, and undergoing 912 procedures confined to the inguinoscrotal region, were enrolled in the study. surgical procedures performed included inguinal herniotomy, orchidopexy and circumcision. of the 731  children, 159 consecutive children had their inguinal and perineal skin flora analysed preoperatively and in 59 of these children three skin swabs were taken from the groin area: before routine skin preparation for surgery, after the skin  preparation and on completion of the operation. staphylococcus epidermidis predominated as the normal skin flora (70%), followed by escherichia coli (19%) and proteus mirabilis (10%), while s. aureus was only found in 2.5% of cases. the efficacy of cleaning with 4% chlorhexidine and 2% povidone-iodine in 70% alcohol  is shown by virtual complete eradication of the organisms isolated from the preoperative skin cultures. in only 2 cases (3.4%) were organisms (s. aureus and  s. epidermidis respectively) isolated following skin preparation. cultures taken  at the end of operative procedures grew predominantly s. epidermidis (5 cases, 8.5%). children were discharged from the day unit once they had taken fluids and  had passed urine. the wounds were also checked for any evidence of bleeding. follow-up was done 2 weeks later by means of a visit to the day unit where the same surgeon assessed wound healing according to the southampton wound assessment scale. ninety-four per cent of the wounds had healed by primary intention; 4.5% had minor complications and 1.5% had septic complications. our trial confirms that wound sepsis is an infrequent but significant complication of day case groin surgery. routine follow-up by surgical day units of minor surgical cases is not warranted and will incur unnecessary cost. only 1.5% of postoperative cases will  require further medical attention and septic lesions in the lymphatic drainage area should be regarded as risk factors.

AB  == objective: to study the infectious background of patients with a history of acute anterior uveitis (aau) and healthy control subjects. methods: sixty four patients with previous aau and 64 sex and age matched controls were studied. serum antibodies to salmonellae, yersiniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, campylobacter jejuni, and borrelia burgdorferi were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), and antibodies to chlamydia trachomatis and chlamydia pneumoniae by microimmunofluorescence test. peripheral  blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs), separated by density gradient centrifugation, were studied for salmonella and yersinia antigens by means of an immunofluorescence test, and for c pneumoniae dna with a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: neither prevalence nor levels of single microbial antibodies studied differed between the patients and control subjects, or between subgroups of patients created on the basis of clinical characteristics. in logistic regression analysis, the high number of recurrences (>10) of aau was independently related to the presence of single or multiple bacterial antibodies  (p=0.04). none of the pbmc samples of the patients were positive for yersinia or  salmonella antigens. c pneumoniae pcr was positive in a patient who was negative  for c pneumoniae antibodies. conclusion: although neither the prevalence nor the  levels of single microbial antibodies studied differed between the patients and the controls, current data suggest that the presence of single or multiple antibodies in patients with many recurrences of aau compared with patients with none or few recurrences may be a sign of repeated infections, antigen persistence, or raised innate immune responsiveness.

AB  == since ages mallotus peltatus (geist) muell. arg. var acuminatus (euphorbiaceae) leaf and stem bark is used in folk medicine to cure intestinal ailments and skin  infections. in several intestinal ailments, localized inflammation is of common occurrence and hence we have evaluated the antimicrobial as well as anti-inflammatory activity of m. peltatus leaf extract. the crude methanol extract of m. peltatus leaves was found to be active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis,  escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis and the dermatophytic fungi microsporum gypseum. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) ranges from 128 to 2000 microg ml(-1) for bacteria and 128 mg ml(-1) for fungi, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was 2-4-fold higher than mic. the methanol-water fraction of the extract showed similar activity against staphylococcus, streptococcus, bacillus and proteus isolates. the anti-inflammatory activity of the extract against carrageenan (acute model) and dextran-induced (subacute model) rat paw oedema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma (chronic model) in rats were studied using indomethacin (10 mg kg(-1)), a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug, as standard. the methanol extract at 200 and 400 mg kg(-1), and the n-butanol fractions a and b at 25 mg kg(-1), exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity in albino rats, compared with indomethacin. phytochemical study revealed the presence of tannins, saponins, terpenoids, steroids and reducing sugars in the crude extract while the n-butanol fractions showed the presence of ursolic acid, beta-sitosterol and some fatty acids as major compounds. further study with fractions showed that the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity is due to either fraction a (ursolic acid) alone or the combination of fractions a and b (beta-sitosterol and fatty acids) of the extract.

TI  == development of an elisa using a recombinant 41 kda partial protein (p45n') for the detection of riemerella anatipestifer infections in ducks.
AB  == riemerella anatipestifer, a gram-negative bacillus, is the causative agent of duck septicemia, a disease which could incur much economic loss in the duck industry. an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) has been developed to facilitate early detection of r. anatipestifer infection in ducks. the antigen used was a recombinant 41 kda n-terminal fragment (rp45n') of a newly characterized r. anatipestifer potential surface protein, p45, which was expressed in escherichia coli as an n-terminal gst fusion protein. the rp45n'-based elisa successfully detected p45 antibodies in the sera of 20 ducks immunized with bacterin preparations of r. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 10 15, 19 and the atcc11845 strain. antibodies to p45 were also detected in the sera of 25% (75/296) of white pekin ducks which were imported into singapore from three different farms. successful discrimination was obtained between sera from infected ducks and that of specific-pathogen free ducks (p<0.01). the rp45n'-gst  antigen did not cross-react with antibodies in sera from guinea pigs which were infected with other gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including aeromonas hydrophila, citrobacter freundii, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pastuerella multocida, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., serratia maccescens, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica. in addition, the dna sequence encoding p45 was detected in r. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and the atcc11845 strain, suggesting that  p45 is probably also universally expressed in these r. anatipestifer serotypes. thus, the elisa described is applicable to the detection of r. anatipestifer infection in ducks.

AB  == stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen associated with opportunistic infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, cancer, and hiv. adherence of this organism to abiotic surfaces such as medical implants and catheters represents a major risk for hospitalized patients. the adhesive surface factors involved in adherence of these bacteria are largely unknown, and their flagella have not yet been characterized biochemically and antigenically. we purified and characterized the flagella produced by s. maltophilia clinical strains. the flagella filaments are composed of a 38-kda subunit, sm(flic), and analysis of its n-terminal amino acid sequence showed considerable sequence identity to the flagellins of serratia marcescens (78.6%), escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei (71.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.2%). ultrastructural analysis by scanning electron microscopy of bacteria adhering to  plastic showed flagellalike structures within the bacterial clusters, suggesting  that flagella are produced as the bacteria spread on the abiotic surface.

TI  == assessment of peo/ptmo multiblock copolymer/segmented polyurethane blends as coating materials for urinary catheters: in vitro bacterial adhesion and encrustation behavior.
AB  == the effective long-term use of indwelling urinary catheters has often been hindered by catheter-associated infection and encrustation. in this study, the suitability of poly(ethylene oxide) (peo)-based multiblock copolymer/segmented polyurethane (spu) blends as coating materials for the commercial urinary catheters was assessed by measuring swellability, bacterial adhesion, and encrustation behavior. when exposed to pbs (ph 7.4), the blends absorbed a significant amount of water, which was proportional to the copolymer content. it  was demonstrated from bacterial adhesion tests that compared to bare spu, the blend surfaces could significantly reduce the adhesion of e. coli, p. mirabilis,  and s. epidermidis; the number of adherent bacteria correlated with the amount of copolymer additive. indicating that the swellability of the blends affected bacterial adhesion. of the bacteria studied, the greatest effect of the copolymer additive was observed in s. epidermidis adhesion, in which there was an 85% decrease compared to bare spu with a small amount of copolymer additive as low as 5% based on a dried blend. by using an artificial bladder model, allowing the catheter to be blocked by encrustation, it was revealed that the blend surfaces could effectively resist encrustation. the duration of patency was extended up to 20 +/- 3.1 h on the blend surface containing 10% of the copolymer additive, whereas the silicone-coated catheter, a control, required the least time for blockage, 7.8 +/- 3.1 h. the superior characteristics of the blends compared to other surfaces might be attributed to their peo-rich surfaces, produced by the migration of peo phase in the copolymer chain of the blends in an aqueous environment, and provide promising potential as a coating material on the urinary catheter for long-term catheterization.

TI  == evaluation of a new etest for detecting metallo-beta-lactamases in routine clinical testing.
AB  == several etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) gradient formats were developed for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases based on the reduction of imipenem (ip) or ceftazidime (tz) mics in the presence of edta or 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa).  the etest metallo-beta-lactamase (etest mbl) strips consisted of a double-sided seven-dilution range of ip or tz (4 to 256 microg/ml) and ip or tz (1 to 64 microg/ml) overlaid with a constant concentration of edta or mpa. the prototype strips were evaluated on several agar media (brain heart infusion agar, isosensitest agar, nutrient agar, and mueller-hinton agar for aerobes and brucella blood agar for anaerobes) with 138 challenge strains: acinetobacter spp. (n = 9), aeromonas spp. (n = 8), chryseobacterium spp. (n = 28), escherichia coli (n = 1), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), proteus  mirabilis (n = 3), serratia spp. (n = 10), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 43), sphingobacterium spp. (n = 3), and bacteroides fragilis group (n = 15). pcr analysis using specific primers for imp-1, l1, ccra, and bla(b/c) confirmed the presence of the metallo-beta-lactamase genes. enzyme assays were also performed with ip as an indicator substrate followed by edta inhibition profiles. edta was  found to be a better inhibitor of metallo-beta-lactamases, especially for anaerobes. ip was a better than tz. mueller-hinton agar was the preferred medium, particularly when compared to isosensitest agar, which frequently produced falsely low mics for ip. etest ip plus ip-edta with mueller-hinton agar had a sensitivity of 94% (79 of 84) and specificity of 95% (124 of 130). the etest mbl  strip appears to be an acceptable diagnostic reagent to detect metallo-beta-lactamase phenotypes in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == interaction of the atypical prokaryotic transcription activator flhd2c2 with early promoters of the flagellar gene hierarchy.
AB  == the transcriptional activator flhd2c2 is the master regulator of bacterial flagellum biogenesis and swarming migration, activating the "early" class ii promoters of the large flagellar gene hierarchy. using primer extensions, band-shift assays, and enzymatic and chemical footprinting, we describe the binding of the flhd2c2 heterotetramer to the promoter regions of four class ii flagella operons, fliaz, flhba and the divergent flgamn and flgbcd(efghij). each  of the promoter regions was bound by a single heterotetramer, i.e. the flgamn and flgbcd operons are characterised by a single flhd2c2 binding site. binding affinity differed, and correlated with previously reported promoter strength and  order of activation. methylation protection and interference, and depurination and depyrimidation interference provided a detailed map of critical bases within  a common 46-59bp dnasei footprint overlapping the promoter -35 sequences. these data and compilation of the 12 known class ii promoter sequences of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella typhimurium allowed determination of a flhd2c2 binding site with pseudo symmetry, comprising two 17-18bp inverted repeats, each a consensus flhd2c2 box, separated by a 10-11bp spacer. dnasei hypersensitivity indicated that binding may cause a conformational change in the  promoter regions. only the flhc subunit can bind dna independently, but the specificity and stability of the interaction is strengthened by flhd. here, photo-crosslinking established that both flhc and the stabilising flhd contact the dna within the flhd2c2 tetramer. our data suggest that specificity of recognition and stability of the flhd2c2/dna complex require protein-protein interaction and interaction of both flhc and flhd subunits with dna. these characteristics of the flhd and flhc subunits in the flhd2c2/dna complex are strikingly atypical of prokaryotic regulators.

TI  == resistant pathogens in urinary tract infections.
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria causing urinary tract infection (uti) has evolved over several decades as antimicrobial exposure has repeatedly been followed by emergence of resistance. older populations in the community, long-term care facilities, or acute care facilities have an increased prevalence  of resistant bacteria isolated from uti. resistant isolates are more frequent in  long-term care populations than the community. resistant isolates include common  uropathogens, such as escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis, and organisms with higher levels of intrinsic resistance, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa or providencia stuartii. isolation of resistant organisms is consistently associated with prior antimicrobial exposure and higher functional impairment. the increased likelihood of resistant bacteria makes it essential that a urine specimen for culture and susceptibility testing be obtained before instituting antimicrobial therapy. therapy for the individual patient must be balanced with the possibility that antimicrobial use will promote further resistance. antimicrobial therapy should be avoided unless there is a clear clinical indication. in particular, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antimicrobials. where symptoms are mild or equivocal, urine culture results should be obtained before initiating therapy. this permits selection of specific therapy for the infecting  organism and avoids empiric, usually broad-spectrum, therapy. where empirical therapy is necessary, prior infecting organisms should be isolated, and recent antimicrobial therapy, as well as regional or facility susceptibility patterns, should be considered in antimicrobial choice. where empirical therapy is used, it should be reassessed 48 to 72 hours after initiation, once pretherapy cultures are available.

TI  == the etiology of urinary tract infection: traditional and emerging pathogens.
AB  == the microbial etiology of urinary infections has been regarded as well established and reasonably consistent. escherichia coli remains the predominant uropathogen (80%) isolated in acute community-acquired uncomplicated infections,  followed by staphylococcus saprophyticus (10% to 15%). klebsiella, enterobacter,  and proteus species, and enterococci infrequently cause uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis. the pathogens traditionally associated with uti are changing  many of their features, particularly because of antimicrobial resistance. the etiology of uti is also affected by underlying host factors that complicate uti,  such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, or catheterization. consequently, complicated uti has a more diverse etiology than uncomplicated uti, and organisms that rarely cause disease in healthy patients can cause significant disease in hosts with anatomic, metabolic, or immunologic underlying disease. the majority of community-acquired symptomatic utis in elderly women are caused by e coli. however, gram-positive organisms are common, and polymicrobial infections account for up to 1 in 3 infections in the elderly. in comparison, the most common organisms isolated in children with uncomplicated uti are enterobacteriaceae. etiologic pathogens associated with uti among patients with diabetes include klebsiella spp., group b streptococci, and enterococcus spp., as well as e coli.  patients with spinal cord injuries commonly have e coli infections. other common  uropathogens include pseudomonas and proteus mirabilis.recent advances in molecular biology may facilitate the identification of new etiologic agents for uti. the need for accurate and updated population surveillance data is apparent,  particularly in light of concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance. this information will directly affect selection of empiric therapy for uti.

TI  == a comparison of the performance of cystine lactose electrolyte deficient (cled) agar with oxoid chromogenic urinary tract infection (cuti) medium for the isolation and presumptive identification of organisms from urine.
AB  == aims: as part of the uk antimicrobial resistance strategy and action plan, the public health laboratory service (phls) is required to collect antibiotic susceptibility data so that resistance trends and patterns can be monitored. most laboratories report urine gram negative isolates, as "coliforms" according to morphological appearance, but without an acceptable identification system the antimicrobial surveillance data will be meaningless. commercially available identification systems tend to be expensive and time consuming. chromogenic agars, which claim to improve the detection of mixed cultures and identification  of organisms from urine, have now become available and may provide a cost effective alternative. the primary aim of this study was to compare the performance of cystine lactose electrolyte deficient (cled) agar with a chromogenic agar (oxoid urinary tract infection medium; cuti) in terms of isolation rates and ability to detect mixed cultures. secondary aims were to evaluate the correlation of "presumptive" identification of isolates from chromogenic media with that of two commercial identification systems and to appraise the sensitivity of the semiquantitative loop and filter paper strip culture techniques. method: one thousand, four hundred and sixty six urine samples were examined in four laboratories using the semiquantitative culture methods of 1 microl loop and filter paper strip. the degree of accuracy of organism identification was measured by comparing the presumptive identification  using colony colour supplemented with simple bench tests, with identification obtained from two more complex commercial systems. results: there was no significant difference between the performance of the loop and filter paper strip methods on the cled agar, but the cuti agar performed significantly better than the cled agar for the detection of significant isolates and mixed cultures. this  difference was greater using the loop method. identification of the organisms using the commercial systems gave > 99% agreement and was therefore considered suitable as a standard against which to compare the presumptive cuti identification. using the manufacturer's colony colour criteria in combination with a bench indole test, the cuti medium was 99% specific for escherichia coli,  although this was reduced to 97% if the indole test was omitted. citrobacter spp  were the most commonly misidentified organisms, giving false presumptive identification as e coli. by testing oxidase activity to differentiate pseudomonas spp and the absence of indole production to support the identification of proteus mirabilis, the cuti medium provided a suitable identification for 86.8% of gram negative isolates. the remaining 13.2% would require further identification. conclusion: cuti medium improves the detection of mixed cultures, thereby improving the reliability of reporting of significant isolates when compared with cled agar. when supplemented with simple bench tests  it provides an identification system capable of speciating 86.8% of gram negative isolates and providing a valuable cost effective mechanism for antimicrobial resistance surveillance.

TI  == emerging fluoroquinolone-resistance for common clinically important gram-negative bacteria in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the three most commonly used fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was measured for 2235 isolates of seven common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. collected from a major teaching hospital in taiwan during the years 1985-86, 1989-90, and 1996-97, the samples were evaluated using the agar dilution method. the overall susceptibility to fluoroquinolones has decreased rapidly after the wide use of these antimicrobial agents. isolates of escherichia coli and morganella morganii  proved quite susceptible to the fluoroquinolones until 1996. by 1996-97, 20% of the bacteria had become resistant to the fluoroquinolones. activity against klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis remained excellent, however, with more than 90% of the isolates susceptible during the survey period. interestingly, some strains of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrating in vitro resistance even before the fluoroquinolones were launched in taiwan. this resistance increased rapidly, with around 20-30% of s. marcescens isolates fluoroquinolone-resistant by 1996-1997. after the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, resistance was demonstrated for about 15% of the p. aeruginosa isolates, and 20% of enterobacter cloacae isolates, with the susceptibility rate remaining steady state through the 1990s. different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns have been demonstrated for most fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, suggesting that the increased resistance was  not due to the spread of a single clone. we conclude a trend of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance for many common gram-negative bacteria in taiwan, especially in recent years. appropriate use of the new fluoroquinolones should be encouraged in order to prevent the rapid emergence and increase of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria.

TI  == new carbenicillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase (carb-7) from vibrio cholerae non-o1, non-o139 strains encoded by the vcr region of the v. cholerae genome.
AB  == in a previous study, an analysis of 77 ampicillin-nonsusceptible (resistant plus  intermediate categories) strains of vibrio cholerae non-o1, non-o139, isolated from aquatic environment and diarrheal stool, showed that all of them produced a  beta-lactamase with a pi of 5.4. hybridization or amplification by pcr with a probe for bla(tem) or primers for bla(carb) gene families was negative. in this work, an environmental ampicillin-resistant strain from this sample, me11762, isolated from a waterway in the west region of argentina, was studied. the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene of the beta-lactamase was determined by bidirectional sequencing of a sau3ai fragment belonging to this isolate. the gene encodes a new 288-amino-acid protein, designated carb-7, that shares 88.5% homology with the carb-6 enzyme; an overall 83.2% homology with pse-4, pse-1, carb-3, and the proteus mirabilis n29 enzymes; and 79% homology with carb-4 enzyme. the gene for this beta-lactamase could not be transferred to escherichia  coli by conjugation. the nucleotide sequence of the flanking regions of the bla(carb-7) gene showed the occurrence of three 123-bp v. cholerae repeated sequences, all of which were found outside the predicted open reading frame. the  upstream fragment of the bla(carb-7) gene shared 93% identity with a locus situated inside v. cholerae's chromosome 2. these results strongly suggest the chromosomal location of the bla(carb-7) gene, making this the first communication of a beta-lactamase gene located on the vcr island of the v. cholerae genome.

AB  == dipstreak is a new urine culture device with two types of agar attached back-to-back on a plastic paddle. it combines dip-slide technology and an original streaking inoculation mechanism, allowing for bacterial counting and colony isolation. the performance of the dipstreak device with two different medium formulations, chromagar and macconkey media in study a and uriselect 3 and macconkey media in study b, was evaluated and compared to that of the reference streak method by using plates of cystine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient (cled) agar, tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep blood, and uriselect 3 medium. in study a, 2,000 urine specimens were processed and 511 cultures were found positive. the dipstreak device and the uriselect 3 and cled medium plates gave the same detection rate, 99.7%. for the direct identification of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterococcus sp. isolates, the dipstreak device and the uriselect  3 medium plate showed overall sensitivities of 97 and 93.4%, respectively. in study b, 3,000 urine specimens were processed and 714 cultures were found positive. the dipstreak device and the uriselect 3 and cled medium plates gave detection rates of 99.4, 99.9, and 99.2%, respectively. for the direct identification of e. coli, p. mirabilis, and enterococcus sp. isolates, the dipstreak device and the uriselect 3 medium plate showed overall sensitivities of 88 and 94.4%, respectively. in conclusion, the dipstreak device with both medium  formulations represents an attractive and excellent screening method for the reliable detection, counting, and presumptive identification of urinary tract pathogens. it enables bedside urine inoculation and provides a valid means of transporting the sample back to the laboratory, decreasing drastically the rate of false-positive results due to bacterial overgrowth and reducing associated costs.

TI  == detection of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase genes in clinical isolates by using multiplex pcr.
AB  == therapeutic options for infections caused by gram-negative organisms expressing plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases are limited because these organisms are usually resistant to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, except for cefepime, cefpirome, and the carbapenems. these organisms are a major concern in nosocomial infections and should therefore be monitored in surveillance studies. six families of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases have been identified, but no phenotypic test can differentiate among them, a fact which creates problems for surveillance and epidemiology studies. this report describes the development of a multiplex pcr for the purpose of identifying family-specific ampc beta-lactamase  genes within gram-negative pathogens. the pcr uses six sets of ampc-specific primers resulting in amplicons that range from 190 bp to 520 bp and that are easily distinguished by gel electrophoresis. ampc multiplex pcr differentiated the six plasmid-mediated ampc-specific families in organisms such as klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella enterica serovar  typhimurium. family-specific primers did not amplify genes from the other families of ampc genes. furthermore, this pcr-based assay differentiated multiple genes within one reaction. in addition, wave technology, a high-pressure liquid chromatography-based separation system, was used as a way of decreasing analysis  time and increasing the sensitivity of multiple-gene assays. in conclusion, a multiplex pcr technique was developed for identifying family-specific ampc genes  responsible for ampc beta-lactamase expression in organisms with or without a chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase gene.

TI  == effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukin-4 on bacteria-enterocyte interactions.
AB  == background: little is known about the mechanisms involved in bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen to extraintestinal sites. because the cytokine cascade associated with sepsis, inflammation, and trauma has been shown  to affect intestinal epithelial permeability, experiments were designed to clarify the effects of selected cytokines on bacterial adherence to and internalization by cultured ht-29 and caco-2 enterocytes. methods: mature, confluent enterocytes were pretreated 48 to 72 h with tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), interferon gamma, (ifn-gamma), or interleukin-4 (il-4). adherence of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and bacterial  internalization was quantified by the gentamicin protection assay. enterocyte permeability was measured by transepithelial electrical resistance and by flux of 40-kda fluorescent dextran. bacterial transmigration across confluent enterocytes was measured using enterocytes cultivated on permeable supports. results: tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, and il-4 had variable effects on bacterial adherence to ht-29 and caco-2 enterocytes, although the most consistent finding was increased  bacterial adherence associated with inf-gamma. however, none of these cytokines had a noticeable effect on bacterial internalization by either caco-2 or ht-29 enterocytes. in addition, none of these cytokines had a noticeable effect on the  permeability of confluent enterocytes as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance or dextran flux. bacterial transmigration across confluent ht-29 enterocytes was not altered by tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, or il-4; however, il-4 consistently decreased bacterial transmigration across confluent caco-2 enterocytes. conclusions: ifn-gamma may augment the epithelial adherence of selected species of enteric bacteria, and il-4 may act as a barrier-sustaining agent to decrease bacterial migration across the intestinal epithelium.

AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == diversity of ctx-m beta-lactamases and their promoter regions from enterobacteriaceae isolated in three parisian hospitals.
AB  == nine clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae (six escherichia coli and three proteus mirabilis) isolated in three parisian hospitals between 1989 and 2000 showed a particular extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistance profile characterized by resistance to cefotaxime and aztreonam but not to ceftazidime. ctx-m-1, ctx-m-2, ctx-m-9, ctx-m-14 and two novel plasmid-mediated ctx-m beta-lactamases (ctx-m-20, and ctx-m-21) were identified by polymerase chain reaction and isoelectric focusing (pi>8) and were associated in eight cases with  tem-1 (pi=5.4) or tem-2 (pi=5.6) beta-lactamases. we used internal isecp1 and is26 forward primers and the ctx-m consensus reverse primer to characterize the ctx-m beta-lactamase promoter regions and showed their high degree of structure diversity. we found upstream of some bla(ctx-m) genes, a 266-bp sequence 100% identical to the sequence upstream of the kluyvera ascorbata beta-lactamase gene, suggesting that this chromosomal enzyme is the progenitor of the ctx-m-2/5 cluster.

TI  == trends in fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) resistance in enterobacteriaceae from bacteremias, england and wales, 1990-1999.
AB  == the public health laboratory service receives antibiotic susceptibility data for  bacteria from bloodstream infections from most hospitals in england and wales. these data were used to ascertain resistance trends to ciprofloxacin from 1990 through 1999 for the most prevalent gram-negative agents: escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., and proteus mirabilis. significant increases  in resistance were observed for all four species groups. for e. coli, ciprofloxacin resistance rose from 0.8% in 1990 to 3.7% in 1999 and became widely scattered among reporting hospitals. the prevalence of resistance in klebsiella spp. rose from 3.5% in 1990, to 9.5% in 1996 and 7.1% in 1999, while that in enterobacter spp. rose from 2.1% in 1990 to 10.5% in 1996 and 10.9% in 1999. for  both klebsiella and enterobacter spp., most resistance was localized in a few centers. resistance was infrequent and scattered in p. mirabilis, but reached a prevalence of 3.3% in 1999.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == [can we rely on the results of urine microscopy and culture when tests are performed in general practice?].
AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant  bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). a microbiological diagnosis can be made  by examination of a urine sample, and in danish family practice the diagnosis of  uti is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. these methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. the aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria  by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. material and methods: urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent  to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. no prior instruction in testing procedure was given. as the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the department of microbiology, university of southern denmark, were used. results: significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. the corresponding figures for urine  culture were 95% and 96%. the morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified  correctly in terms of their motility. discussion: the results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.

TI  == prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae: an italian survey.
AB  == the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production by consecutive non-repeated isolates of enterobacteriaceae was determined over a 6-month period. a total of 8015 strains were isolated from ten italian laboratories and 509 (6.3%) of these were designated esbl producers from the results of a double-disk synergy test. escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. providencia stuartii (28.1%) was the most frequently isolated esbl producer, followed by k. pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes (20.5%). however, amongst all esbl producers, k. pneumoniae (38.2%) was the most represented followed by p. mirabilis (25.7%). all the strains positive to dd tests were confirmed for the carriage of tem and shv genes using colony-blot hybridisation (ch). a total of 447 strains (88.0%) were ch-positive, of which 42.3% hybridised with the tem-type probe, 30.1% with the shv-type probe and 15.6% with both probes. in conclusion, our findings indicate that 6.3% of all enterobacteriaceae tested produced esbls,  42.3% of which were tem-derived enzymes. more than 20% of p. stuartii, k. pneumoniae and e. aerogenes harbour these enzymes. the double-disk test seems to  be a useful test to identify esbl producing strains.

TI  == prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing clinical isolates in the asia-pacific region and south africa: regional results from sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1998-99).
AB  == the frequency of occurrence of esbl-producing clinical strains varies widely in distinct geographic areas. the objective of this study was to describe the frequency of occurrence, the preferred substrate, and the co-resistance patterns  of the esbl-producing isolates collected from the asia-pacific region and south africa through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program between january 1998 and december 1999. a total of 1,377 escherichia coli, 678 klebsiella pneumoniae,  and 138 proteus mirabilis isolates were collected from diverse body sites. using  nccls criteria, 139 e. coli (10.1%), 171 k. pneumoniae (25.2%), and 2 p. mirabilis (1.4%) had presumptive esbl phenotypes; 100, 146 and 1 strain respectively were confirmed to be esbl producers on clavulanate enhancement testing. the frequency of occurrence of confirmed esbl-producing e. coli by the medical centers varied from 0-1% for centers located in australia to 13-35% for mainland chinese centers. the higher prevalence rates (>20%) of esbl k. pneumoniae phenotypes were observed in all mainland chinese centers, one japanese and one taiwanese center, and in the philippine, south african, singaporean and medical centers. the spread of the presumptive esbl phenotype to the enterobacter species was observed in nine medical centers. overall, ceftriaxone and aztreonam  were the best substrates for the detection of the esbl phenotype between both e.  coli isolates and k. pneumoniae esbl phenotypes; however, there was significant variation between countries in substrate preference. co-resistances to gentamicin, tobramycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were common throughout isolates collected from most medical centers. ciprofloxacin resistance rates were very high among isolates collected from hong kong, mainland china, singapore, and the philippines. the best coverage against esbl-producing isolates was obtained with imipenem (0% resistance), followed by amikacin (6% resistance).

TI  == properties and utility of the peculiar mixed disulfide in the bacterial glutathione transferase b1-1.
AB  == bacterial glutathione transferases appear to represent an evolutionary link between the thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase and glutathione transferase superfamilies. in particular, the observation of a mixed disulfide in the active  site of proteus mirabilis glutathione transferase b1-1 is a feature that links the two families. this peculiar mixed disulfide between cys10 and one gsh molecule has been studied by means of esr spectroscopy, stopped-flow kinetic analysis, radiochemistry, and site-directed mutagenesis. this disulfide can be reduced by dithiothreitol but even a thousand molar excess of gsh is poorly effective due to an unfavorable equilibrium constant of the redox reaction (k(eq) = 2 x 10(-4)). although cys10 is partially buried in the crystal structure, in solution it reacts with several thiol reagents at a higher or comparable rate than that shown by the free cysteine. kinetics of the reaction of cys10 with 4,4'-dithiodipyridine at variable ph values is consistent with a pk(a) of 8.0 +/- 0.1 for this residue, a value about 1 unit lower than that of the free cysteine.  the 4,4'-dithiodipyridine-modified enzyme reacts with gsh in a two-step mechanism involving a fast precomplex formation, followed by a slower chemical step. the natural cys10-gsh mixed disulfide exchanges rapidly with free [3h]gsh in a futile redox cycle in which the bound gsh is continuously replaced by the external gsh.  our data suggest that the active site of the bacterial enzyme has intermediate properties between those of the recently evolved glutathione transferases and those of the thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase superfamily.

TI  == the migration of proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over foley catheters.
AB  == objective: to examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of foley catheters. materials and methods: in a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. the sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. the plates were incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms  on the agar on the other side of the bridges. a collection of swarming, swimming  and nonmotile species were tested in the model. the relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage  of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. results: the swarmer cells of proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris migrated  successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. the migration index of serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. the mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). the swarmer cells of p. mirabilis  moved through populations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections  of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. they were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of k. pneumoniae and s. aureus over the catheters. the migration index of p. mirabilis  swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of ps. aeruginosa and s. marcescens. conclusions: hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. with the exception of s. marcescens, the  incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and p. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. this suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.

TI  == novel bacterial membrane surface display system using cell wall-less l-forms of proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli.
AB  == we describe a novel membrane surface display system that allows the anchoring of  foreign proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane (cm) of stable, cell wall-less l-form cells of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. the reporter protein, staphylokinase (sak), was fused to transmembrane domains of integral membrane proteins from e. coli (lactose permease lacy, preprotein translocase secy) and p. mirabilis (curved cell morphology protein ccma). both l-form strains overexpressed fusion proteins in amounts of 1 to 100 microg ml(-1), with higher expression for those with homologous anchor motifs. various experimental approaches, e.g., cell fractionation, percoll gradient purification, and solubilization of the cm, demonstrated that the fusion proteins are tightly bound to the cm and do not form aggregates. trypsin digestion, as well as electron microscopy of immunogold-labeled replicas, confirmed that the protein was localized on the outside surface. the displayed sak showed functional activity, indicating correct folding. this membrane surface display system features endotoxin-poor organisms and can provide a novel platform for numerous applications.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among commonly isolated gram-negative bacilli  in 2000: trust and tsn data for the united states. tracking resistance in the united states today. the surveillance network.
AB  == from january to may 2000, as part of the tracking resistance in the united states today (trust) surveillance initiative, clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n=2519) and non-fermentative gram-negatives (n=580) were prospectively collected from 26 hospital laboratories across the united states. isolates were tested for  susceptibility to three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin) and seven other agents. in addition, data for the same period were  collected from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa, an electronic surveillance network that receives data from more than 200 laboratories in the us. both surveillance methods produced similar results. against isolates of enterobacteriaceae, imipenem was the most active agent, followed by the fluoroquinolones; > or = 86.7% of isolates of all species of enterobacteriaceae except providencia spp. were susceptible to fluoroquinolones by trust and tsn surveillance. trust identified differences in susceptibility to the three fluoroquinolones of > or = 2% for citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens. isolates of p. mirabilis were considerably more susceptible to levofloxacin (94.0%) than to ciprofloxacin (87.7%) and gatifloxacin (87.7%). other results from trust included pseudomonas aeruginosa being slightly more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (73.5%) and levofloxacin (73.0%) than gatifloxacin (71.0%). imipenem was the only compound with significant activity (95.1% susceptible, trust; 87.4% susceptible, tsn) against acinetobacter baumannii, but it was inactive against stenotrophomonas maltophilia. s. maltophilia isolates were more susceptible to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin (77.7-79.8%) than ciprofloxacin (29.7-33.0%). against 513 urinary isolates of escherichia coli in trust, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equipotent. age and gender had no clear effect on the activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or gatifloxacin. similar results for all three fluoroquinolones were seen in outpatients and inpatients. trust and tsn data indicated that resistance rates had not changed appreciably for any compound studied since a similar study conducted in 1999. trust centralized in vitro and electronic (tsn)  surveillance methods provided an effective strategy for monitoring trends in resistance.

TI  == sudden increase in pseudomonas aeruginosa nosocomial strains with broad host range transfer of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == we investigated transfer of antibiotic resistance from 51 multiply resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from seriously ill patients in the frankfurt university clinics. nine isolates directly transferred resistance to three recipient strains used. ticarcillin and cephalothin resistance determinants were accepted from eight isolates, and in one case a kanamycin resistance determinant was transferred. the total spectrum of resistance transferred demonstrated that several donor strains transferred a different set of resistance determinants to all three recipient strains. two p. aeruginosa isolates transferred spectrum of seven resistance determinants including ceftazidime, cefepime and aztreonam, three isolates transferred five determinants and four isolates transferred four resistance determinants. the fact that identical spectra of multiple drug resistance were transferred to recipient strains belonging to three different species (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and p.  aeruginosa), indicates a broad host range in all three transferable genetic elements not observed in previous transfers from p. aeruginosa strains.

TI  == occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in members of the family enterobacteriaceae in italy: implications for resistance to beta-lactams and other antimicrobial drugs.
AB  == an italian nationwide survey was carried out to assess the prevalences and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of members of the family enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). over a 6-month period, 8,015 isolates were obtained from hospitalized patients and screened for resistance to  extended-spectrum cephalosporins and monobactams. on the basis of a synergistic effect between clavulanate and selected beta-lactams (ceftazidime, aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefepime, and ceftriaxone), 509 isolates were found to be esbl positive (6.3%). colony blot hybridization with bla(tem) and bla(shv) dna probes  allowed one to distinguish four different genotypes: tem-positive, shv-positive,  tem- and shv-positive, and non-tem, non-shv esbl types. mics for each isolate (e-test) were obtained for widely used beta-lactams, combinations of beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. among esbl-positive strains, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia  coli accounted for 73.6% of isolates. overall, tem-type esbls were more prevalent than shv-type enzymes (234 versus 173), whereas the prevalence of strains producing both tem- and shv-type esbls was similar to that of isolates producing  non-tem, non-shv enzymes (55 and 38, respectively). in vitro, all but one of the  esbl-producing isolates remained susceptible to imipenem. susceptibility to other drugs varied: piperacillin-tazobactam, 91%; amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 85%; cefoxitin, 78%; amikacin, 76%; ampicillin-sulbactam, 61%; ciprofloxacin, 58%; and gentamicin, 56%. associated resistance to aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin was observed most frequently among tem-positive strains. since therapeutic options for multiresistant enterobacteriaceae are limited, combinations of beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors appear to represent an important alternative for treating infections caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae:

TI  == retrospective study of children with acute pyelonephritis. evaluation of bacterial etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, drug management and imaging studies.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to investigate the management of pyelonephritis in a large italian pediatric population. a total of 1,333 patients (36% male) were considered. escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated agent (89.9%), followed by proteus mirabilis (3.6%) and klebsiella oxytoca (2.1%). 27% of microorganisms were resistant to amoxicillin, 4% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,  11% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 2.4% to gentamicin and less than 2% to ceftazidime. despite this resistance pattern showing that oral antibiotics, such  as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, are effective in vitro as well as parenteral antimicrobials, a parenteral antibiotic was given initially to 756 (57.2%) children. a prophylactic regimen was started in 922 patients with a rate of reinfection during prophylaxis of 9.5%; a higher rate of reinfection was observed in patients with reflux (25%) compared to children without reflux (3%) (p < 0.0001). vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 30% of patients. the number of renal abnormalities detected by dmsa in patients with and without reflux was significantly different (p < 0.001). crp was higher in patients with scars (p < 0.02). in conclusion, pyelonephritis represents a common disease with about 2,500 days of hospitalization per year in the veneto region where there is a pediatric  population of about 800,000 under 15 years of age. the results of antimicrobial in vitro tests indicate that amoxillicin/clavulanic acid could represent the antibiotic of choice. the high frequency of malformations, observed even in children between 6 and 12 years of age, may suggest the need of an imaging study  including dmsa scan and vcug in all age groups.

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers.
AB  == in a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (ubts) at intervals for up to 144 h. ofloxacin showed higher  concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. the median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug  administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. the ubts, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were  still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens  for which the mics of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: escherichia coli atcc 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively;  pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. generally, the ubts for  gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the ubts for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. according to the ubts, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (mics, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.

TI  == gram-negative bacterial toe web infection: a survey of 123 cases from the district of cagliari, italy.
AB  == background: foot intertrigo is mostly caused by dermatophytes and yeasts, less frequently by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. nevertheless, the importance of polymicrobial infections and especially colonizations of pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause therapy problems in relation to antibiotic resistance and the risk of potentially lethal complications. objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the main epidemiologic and clinical features of intertrigo from gram-negative bacteria, the function of promoting factors, and the measures taken to treat and prevent this disorder. methods: between 1989 and  1998, 123 cases of intertrigo from gram-negative bacteria were observed at the cagliari university dermatology department. routine clinical and blood examinations, repeated bacterioscopic and mycologic examinations, cultures aimed  at identifying the responsible bacteria, and antibiograms were performed. results: p aeruginosa was found to be the prevailing pathogen, both alone and associated with other gram-negative bacteria (such as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii) and gram-positive bacteria. clinical manifestations were similar in the majority of patients: erythema, vesicopustules, erosions, and marked maceration caused by abundant, malodorous exudate. lesions affected the interdigital spaces of both feet and frequently extended to the planta and the back of the toes. patients complained of burning and pain. successful therapies were achieved with combined topical and systemic treatment; to avoid the risk of antimicrobial resistance, the choice of the active antibiotic was guided by antibiograms. conclusion: in all symptomatic toe  web infections, the presence of gram-negative germs, such as p aeruginosa, should be investigated to avoid the risk of treatment failures and more severe local or  systemic complications.

TI  == repression of bacterial motility by a novel fimbrial gene product.
AB  == proteus mirabilis is a common uropathogen in patients with long-term catheterization or with structural or functional abnormalities in the urinary tract. the mannose-resistant, proteus-like (mr/p) fimbriae and flagellum are among virulence factors of p.mirabilis that contribute to its colonization in a murine model of ascending urinary tract infection. mrpj, the last of nine genes of the mrp operon, encodes a 107 amino acid protein that contains a putative helix-turn-helix domain. using transcriptional lacz fusions integrated into the chromosome and mutagenesis studies, we demonstrate that mrpj represses transcription of the flagellar regulon and thus reduces flagella synthesis when mr/p fimbriae are produced. the repression of flagella synthesis by mrpj is confirmed by electron microscopy. however, a gel mobility shift assay indicates that mrpj does not bind directly to the regulatory region of the flhdc operon. the isogenic mrpj null mutant of wild-type p.mirabilis strain hi4320 is attenuated in the murine model. our data also indicate that papx encoded by a pap (pyelonephritis- associated pilus) operon of uropathogenic escherichia coli is a  functional homolog of mrpj.

TI  == site-directed mutagenesis and phylogenetic comparisons of the escherichia coli tus protein: dna-protein interactions alone can not account for tus activity.
AB  == the tus protein of escherichia coli is capable of arresting dna replication in an orientation-dependent manner when bound to specific sequences in the bacterial chromosome called ter sites. arrest of dna replication has been postulated to occur either by a barrier mechanism, where tus acts as a physical block to replication fork progression, or through protein-protein interactions between tus and some component of the replication fork. a previous mutational analysis of tus suggested that the amino acids in the l1 loop might play a role in replication arrest. site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids in the l1 loop and other amino acid residues on the "non-permissive" face of tus was performed to identify residues that affected tus function. one mutant, e47q, gave results that are inconsistent with the barrier model, showing a greater affinity for the ter site  (with a t 1/2 of 348 min versus 150 min for wild-type tus) but a reduced ability  to arrest dna replication in vivo. in addition to the site-directed mutagenesis studies, the tus genes of salmonella, klebsiella, and yersinia were sequenced and the proteins expressed in e. coli to assess their ability to arrest dna replication. the results presented here support a role for protein-protein interactions in tus function, and suggest that residues e47 and e49 participate in replication fork arrest.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among urinary tract pathogens isolated from female outpatients across the us in 1999.
AB  == in the united states, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (tmp-smx) is the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis) in females, in regions with resistance rates of <10-20%. unfortunately, current data on regional resistance is often not readily available to physicians and regional  variability in resistance remains largely unknown. this report presents antimicrobial susceptibility data for tmp-smx and three other commonly tested antimicrobials organized by state and region to demonstrate current regional variability in resistance in the us. in the last quarter of 1999, 5739 fresh clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus saprophyticus were collected from 202 laboratories throughout  the us. susceptibility testing was performed against tmp-smx, cephalothin, nitrofurantoin and ciprofloxacin using broth microdilution. data were analyzed by patient age and specimen source, and by state and region. in the us as a whole, resistance to tmp-smx was 16.8% for e. coli, 7.8% for k. pneumoniae, 12.1% for p. mirabilis and 3.0% for s. saprophyticus, but these rates showed considerable regional variation. by state, e. coli resistance ranged from 7.4% in pennsylvania to 33.3% in iowa (among states with > or =50 isolates tested). regionally, resistance for all uropathogens taken together ranged from 8.5% in east south-central to 22.8% in west south-central. ciprofloxacin demonstrated the broadest activity of the antimicrobials tested and was more active than tmp-smx against all pathogens. resistance to tmp-smx among e. coli now approaches or exceeds 20% in some areas. as resistance among uropathogens reaches clinically significant levels in many areas, continued regional surveillance is essential to ensure the provision of effective empiric therapy for urinary tract infections.

TI  == epidemiology and frequency of resistance among pathogens causing urinary tract infections in 1,510 hospitalized patients: a report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (north america).
AB  == bacterial urinary tract infections (utis) are an important cause of septicemia resulting in high mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays and increased healthcare costs. periodic reviews of pathogen frequency and susceptibility patterns impact on appropriate antimicrobial usage, leading to more effective prescribing practices. as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (sentry, 1998), participants collected 50 consecutive uti pathogens from patients hospitalized in 31 medical centers (26 in the united states and five in canada) and forwarded subcultures to the coordinating center. thirty-four antimicrobial agents were tested including two investigational compounds (quinupristin/dalfopristin [q/d], gatifloxacin). the rank order of the 32 species identified during the study was: escherichia coli (46.9%) > enterococcus spp. (12.8%) > klebsiella spp. (11.0%) > pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%) > proteus mirabilis (5.0%) > coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 3.4%). this pathogen rank order did not change from 1997 to 1998, but resistance patterns changed. clonal spread of confirmed extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains was not observed, but co-resistance was elevated for aminoglycosides, tetracyclines,  sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones. p. aeruginosa was most susceptible to amikacin (97.3%) > piperacillin +/- tazobactam (92.0-95.6%) > cefepime = imipenem (91.2%) > ceftazidime (85.8%). fluoroquinolone resistance was greater in p. aeruginosa (24.8-39.8%) > p. mirabilis (5.3-13.3%) > enterobacter spp. (6.7-8.9%) > klebsiella spp. (4.2-7.8%) > e. coli (3.0-3.8%). only 5% of enterococci were resistant to vancomycin. these results emphasize the need for continued surveillance studies for common infections which establish baseline resistance patterns by geographic areas, and have the potential to detect epidemics or direct local epidemiologic interventions.

TI  == [determination of the antibacterial and antiviral activity of the essential oil from minthostachys verticillata (griseb.) epling].
AB  == the in vitro antiviral activity of the essential oil from minthostachys verticillata was investigated against herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) and pseudorabies virus (prv). the viral inhibition was assayed employing viral plaque reduction assay. the antiviral activity of the essential oil specifically affects prv and hsv-1 multiplication, since it was found that non toxic effects on cells  were observed at the concentrations assayed. the therapeutic index values were 10.0 and 9.5 for hsv-1 and prv, respectively. the antibacterial activity was studied using a diffusion assay and the broth tube dilution method. gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition by plant essential oil than the gram-negative bacteria. the essential oil of m. verticillata was analyzed by gas  chromatography (gc) technique. of the six components identified in the volatile oil, pulegone (44.56%) and menthone (39.51%) were the major constituents. the antimicrobial activity can be explained to some extent by the presence of pulegone. results suggest that further investigations concerning the isolation of the substance responsible for the antimicrobial activity and an effort to define  the mechanisms of action are warranted.

TI  == dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  == dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within duws. these methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. in order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. there are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. however, the food and drug administration have not approved all products currently on the market. our evaluation of zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use  and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. it is also economical  and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the duws was free from any viable microorganisms. this effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. the elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the duws  was performed. although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of duws following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. finally, the product can be  delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. from our study, zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. based on the research that  has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. a combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality  dental treatment water. independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ada, osap, and cdc guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. it is expected that  in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems  and products to deal with this issue. until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in duws.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of alstonia macrophylla: a folklore of bay islands.
AB  == the methanolic crude and methanol-aqueous extract of alstonia macrophylla leaves  and n-butanol part of the crude extract showed antimicrobial activity against various strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, trichophyton rubrum, trichophyton mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes and microsporum gypseum. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranges from 64 to 1000 microg/ml for bacteria and 32-128 mg/ml for dermatophytes. however, the strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella sp. and vibrio cholerae showed resistance against in vitro treatment of the extracts up to 2000 microg/ml concentration, while the two yeast species were resistant even at 128 mg/ml concentration. the stem bark extract prepared similarly was found to be less active compared to the  leaves. phytochemical study indicates that the crude extract contains tannins, flavonoids, saponins, sterols, triterpene and reducing sugars. further fractionation and purification of n-butanol part of the extract showed the presence of beta-sitosterol, ursolic acid, beta-sitosterol glucoside and a mixture of minor compounds only detected in tlc.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [escherichia coli eradication from the blader urine by amoxicillin-sulbactam. intrinsic activity of the inhibitor].
AB  == rationale: at urine concentrations obtained after the oral administration of amoxicillin-sulbactam (500/500 mg) this combination inhibits roughly 90% of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis strains. aims: to administer amoxicilin-sulbactam 875/125 mg and to determine: a) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of sulbactam for e. coli and p. mirabilis; b) urine inhibitory titres power (uit) against amoxicillin-resistant e. coli or p. mirabilis; c) urine concentrations of sulbactam; and to verify whether sulbactam  125 mg as single drug, attains a high enough uit to support the intrinsic action  of the inhibitor; and to compare the activity of amoxicillin-sulbactam and amoxicillin-clavulanate and that of sulbactam and clavulanate. methods: twelve healthy volunteers received a single oral dose of amoxicillin-sulbactam 875/125 mg or amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg, according to a randomized cross-over design. urine samples were drawn at: 0 (basal), 2, 4, and 6 hours after dosing. urine ph, specific gravidity and uip were assessed. thirty nine strains isolated  from urine samples were used: 30 tem-1 producing e. coli strains and 3 extended spectrum ctx-m-2 betalactamase-producing e. coli; and 6 p. mirabilis resistant to both combinations. in 6 healthy volunteers, sulbactam 125 mg was administered orally and uit against e. coli (mic amoxicillin > 2048 mg/l) was assessed. results and discussion: mic-90 for amoxicillin plus sulbactam or clavulanate were similar to those for sulbactam or clavulanate alone, without any difference attributable to the chemical composition of the urine. the activity of amoxicillin plus the inhibitors could be due, not only to the inhibition of betalactamase but also to the intrinsic effect of the inhibitor. both combinations showed an equivalent inhibitory activity. two-hour uit remained high for the entire 6-h evaluation period. sulbactam concentration far exceed sulbactam mic for the 6h-period, inhibiting urine e. coli. we disagree with the cut-off limit proposed for intermediate values of nccls, which, for these antimicrobial are 16/8, a value lower than those obtained in urine samples after  the administration of betalactamase inhibitors. this may be an explanation for the beneficial effect of amoxicillin-sulbactam in the recovery of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women when the involved strains were considered resistant by diffusional methods.

TI  == urinary tract infections in general practice in a rural community in south trinidad.
AB  == objective: a prospective study was carried out at a general practice in south trinidad, to assess the sensitivity profiles of urinary isolates in this remote rural community. methods: quantitative bacteriologic cultures were performed according to standard procedures. identification of isolates was based on gram reaction, morphology and biochemical reactions. susceptibility testing was carried out using commonly prescribed antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infections. results: from 779 urine specimens, 49% were culture positive for counts >105 organisms per ml. three hundred and eighteen were aged 21 years and above and 85.5% of these were females. the lowest incidence of urinary tract  infections, 8%, was seen among the 13-20 year old age group. most males above 50  years had indwelling urethral catheters due to prostatic disease. escherichia coli was the predominant isolate, 71%, followed by proteus mirabilis, 9%, and klebsiella pneumoniae, 7%. all urinary tract infections isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin and >96% (except for citrobacter species, 63%) were sensitive to cefuroxime. apart from enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus saprophyticus, the overall sensitivity to ampicillin by all isolates was <33%. the prevalence of multi-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. all pseudomonas aeruginosa were fully sensitive to gentamicin and ofloxacin. conclusion: the high frequency of single and multiple antibiotic resistances in this rural community should cause alarm. the ease of procuring antibiotics in these areas without a prescription can result in uncontrolled self-medication. also, the absence of antibiotic prescribing policies and inadequate information on patterns of bacterial resistance, may all contribute to the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == antimicrobial agent resistance in bacterial isolates from patients with diarrhea  and urinary tract infection in the sudan.
AB  == antimicrobial sensitivity tests were performed on four-hundred and ninety-seven bacterial isolates from sudanese patients with diarrhea or urinary tract infections. shigella dysenteriae type i and enteropathogenic escherichia coli showed high resistance rates (percentage of isolates showing antibiotic resistance) against the commonly-used antimicrobial agents: ampicillin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, sulfonamide, and neomycin, and were completely sensitive to ciprofloxacin. eighteen resistance patterns against nine antimicrobial agents tested were observed in enteric pathogens. resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, and sulfonamide was the most frequent pattern. the common urinary pathogens, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis showed high rates of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline, sulfonamide, trimethoprim, streptomycin, and carbenicillin. we recommend that physicians seek updated knowledge of the common antibiotic-sensitivity patterns when starting empirical antibiotic therapy in sudanese patients with diarrhea or urinary tract infection.

TI  == the development of the bsac standardized method of disc diffusion testing.
AB  == the bsac working party on susceptibility testing has developed a standardized method of disc susceptibility testing that has been 'field tested' in 19 diagnostic laboratories in the uk and ireland. the method employs semi-defined media, a semi-confluent inoculum and relates zones of inhibition with bsac-specified mic breakpoints to interpret susceptibility. the bacteria selected for the trial included clinical isolates and control strains from the atcc and nctc national collections. organisms were chosen because they had known attributes, such as being fully susceptible or having a demonstrated mechanism of resistance. the results from this survey are very encouraging. with the commonly  isolated enterobacteriaceae, specifically escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp., no major problems were observed except with gentamicin and cefuroxime. in the case of gentamicin, problems were associated with resistant strains of p. mirabilis, with mics of 2 mg/l, being falsely reported as susceptible. for cefuroxime, it is not unexpected that results were unreliable, as the mic distribution straddles the in vitro breakpoint concentration (following the results of this study the mic and zone diameter breakpoints have been amended to improve reporting). no major problems were encountered for pseudomonas aeruginosa with the agents studied. the 'field survey' has shown that disc testing is unreliable for determining the susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci to teicoplanin, and that the detection of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci is improved by incubation for a full 24 h. inconsistencies observed with fastidious organisms were associated with incorrect inocula. zone diameter data for the control strains studied provide information that can be utilized by diagnostic laboratories to monitor the daily performance  of testing.

TI  == activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  == this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were  susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was  statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the  presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.

TI  == tissue antioxidant capacity and bacterial translocation under total parenteral nutrition.
AB  == alterations in the antioxidative system have been observed during total parenteral nutrition (tpn). light exposure or changes in the composition of tpn formulas may affect this system. bacterial translocation (bt) is frequent under tpn and may be related to oxidative status. the aim of this study was to determine the adverse effects of standard and glutamine-enriched tpn, with or without light exposure, on oxidative status (liver and kidney-reduced glutathione, gsh) and its relationship to bt. thirty-three adult wistar rats underwent central-venous cannulation and were randomly assigned to one of four groups receiving different tpn regimes for 10 days. the tpn group (n = 10) had standard tpn, the tpn(-) group (n = 8) standard tpn without light exposure, the gtpn group (n = 8) glutamine-enriched tpn, and the gtpn(-) group (n = 7) glutamine-enriched tpn without light exposure. a sham group (n = 16) receiving chow and water ad libitum and saline i.v. served as controls. at the end of the experiment, gsh was determined in liver and kidney tissue. mesenteric lymph nodes and peripheral and portal blood samples were cultured for bt. compared to sham rats, tpn groups had statistically significant lower gsh levels, but there were no differences between standard or glutamine-enriched groups or light-exposure groups. sham animals had 12% bt. significantly higher bt (p < 0.05) occurred in tpn rats: 70% in the tpn group, 88% in the tpn(-) group, 86% in gtpn (-) animals, and only 50% in the gtpn group (p = 0.06 vs tpn group). in conclusion, (1) tpn reduces antioxidant capacity; (2) glutamine supplementation or light protection does not improve tissue antioxidant capacity under tpn; (3) the absence of light  exposure does not improve tpn-related bt; and (4) glutamine supplementation tends to reduce bt only in the presence of light.

TI  == [effect of bioceramics on biological activity of microorganisms].
AB  == background and objective: biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. patients and methods: in this study, bioverit, al2o3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and candida albicans. results: in the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and candida albicans were not affected. the al2o3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. streptococcus  pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. in contrast, bioverit and al2o3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. conclusions: in conclusion, we think that bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.

TI  == novel type of fimbriae encoded by the large plasmid of sorbitol-fermenting enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h(-).
AB  == sorbitol-fermenting (sf) enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157:h(-) have emerged as important causes of diarrheal diseases and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome in germany. in this study, we characterized a 32-kb fragment of the plasmid of sf ehec o157:h(-), psfo157, which differs markedly from plasmid po157  of classical non-sorbitol-fermenting ehec o157:h7. we found a cluster of six genes, termed sfpa, sfph, sfpc, sfpd, sfpj, and sfpg, which mediate mannose-resistant hemagglutination and the expression of fimbriae. sfp genes are  similar to the pap genes, encoding p-fimbriae of uropathogenic e. coli, but the sfp cluster lacks homologues of genes encoding subunits of a tip fibrillum as well as regulatory genes. the major pilin, sfpa, despite its similarity to papa,  does not cluster together with known papa alleles in a phylogenetic tree but is structurally related to the pmpa pilin of proteus mirabilis. the putative adhesin gene sfpg, responsible for the hemagglutination phenotype, shows significant homology neither to papg nor to other known sequences. sfp fimbriae are 3 to 5 nm in diameter, in contrast to p-fimbriae, which are 7 nm in diameter. pcr analyses  showed that the sfp gene cluster is a characteristic of sf ehec o157:h(-) strains and is not present in other ehec isolates, diarrheagenic e. coli, or other enterobacteriaceae. the sfp gene cluster is flanked by two blocks of insertion sequences and an origin of plasmid replication, indicating that horizontal gene transfer may have contributed to the presence of sfp fimbriae in sf ehec o157:h(-).

TI  == integrin expression, enterocyte maturation, and bacterial internalization.
AB  == background: little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the translocation of enteric bacteria. adhesion molecules mediate interactions between some enteric pathogens and mammalian cells, but no such interactions have been identified for enterocytes and normal enteric bacteria. using enteric pathogens, adhesion molecule expression has been linked to bacterial internalization and to enterocyte differentiation. therefore, experiments were designed to study enterocyte integrin expression and differentiation, as well as  enterocyte internalization of salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli. materials and methods: relative expression of the alpha2, alpha3, and beta1 integrin subunits on caco-2 and ht-29 enterocytes (mature and immature) was measured by elisa. bacteria-enterocyte surface interactions were observed by light and scanning electron microscopy. bacterial internalization by  enterocytes was quantified using the gentamicin protection assay. results: expression of the alpha2, alpha3, and beta1 integrin subunits was consistently increased in immature compared to mature caco-2 enterocytes; however, compared to mature enterocytes, immature ht-29 enterocytes had similar expression of alpha3 and beta1 but decreased alpha2. compared to untreated mature enterocytes, bacterial internalization was increased in immature enterocytes as well as mature enterocytes with lateral membranes artifactually exposed. however, there was no difference in bacterial internalization between immature enterocytes and mature enterocytes treated to expose the lateral membrane. conclusions: bacterial internalization by enterocytes appeared to be due to factors other than integrin  expression or enterocyte differentiation. exposure of the lateral enterocyte membrane may play an important role in facilitating bacterial internalization by  enterocytes.

TI  == phenotypic variability of beta-glucoside utilization and its correlation to pathogenesis process in a few enteric bacteria.
AB  == utilization of beta-glucosides is markedly variable in the members of the family  enterobacteriaceae. the results presented here provide molecular clues for evolutionary events that resulted in the phenotypic variability seen amongst the  members of these species. the genomic hybridization of selected enterobacteriaceae members with the escherichia coli bgl and cel genes resulted in detection of a complete homolog of the bgl and cel operons in shigella sonnei, a member that is evolutionarily closest to e. coli. however, the salmonella group of organisms have been shown to carry only a homolog of bglr and bglg regions and the deletions of the bglf and bglb genes. similarly, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and a non-enteric gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to carry a homolog of the bglr and bglg regions and deletions of the bglf and bglb genes. the homolog of the cel operon could be identified in s. sonnei and salmonella groups of organisms. possible implications of these observations, in connection with the phenotypic variability seen in beta-glucoside utilization amongst these members, are discussed.

AB  == a recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in klebsiella pneumoniae c3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to escherichia coli k-12. the recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coad genes, as  was found in e. coli k-12. pcr amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative k. pneumoniae strains. partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. complementation analysis of known waa mutants from e. coli k-12 and/or salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the enterobacteriaceae. k. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. analysis of a constructed k. pneumoniae waae deletion mutant suggests that the waae protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-d-glc to the o-4 position of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose i, a feature shared by k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and yersinia enterocolitica.

AB  == the phenomenon of increasing bactericidal activity of n-chlorotaurine in the presence of chlorine-consuming material has been investigated both on a chemical-analytical and microbiological basis using plasma as substrate and chloramine t for comparison. chlorine consumption assessed by iodometric titration showed a biphasic time-course with a very fast loss of oxidation capacity within one minute (n-chlorotaurine: -9.3%, chloramine t: -16.8%) followed by a slow loss which could still be detected after 24 h (total loss -61.7% and -74.1%, respectively). killing curves revealed that an increase in bactericidal activity, in spite of improved consumption, did not occur with all strains, and could be detected only at a certain degree of consumption. escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the most pronounced effect, streptococcus pyogenes and proteus mirabilis a medium-sized one, while it was absent in staphylococcus aureus. with chloramine t, an increase in bactericidal activity could not be proved. the chemical basis of these consumption effects can be reduced to four reaction types: oxidation of thiols; chlorine substitution of  activated c-h compounds; transhalogenation; and hydrolytic degradation of n-chloro-alpha-amino acids and -peptides emerging by transhalogenation. the initial fast loss of oxidation capacity can be attributed mainly to oxidation of  thiols, while the subsequent slower decrease is caused by the other types of reaction. the increase in bactericidal activity, on the other hand, can be explained by transhalogenation, leading to the formation of more bactericidal n-chloro compounds by which the loss of n-chlorotaurine is over-compensated.

TI  == antibiotic selective pressure and development of bacterial resistance.
AB  == this study evaluates the development of resistance in gram-negative rods to cefotaxime and ceftazidime, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and amikacin, meropenem and ampicillin/sulbactam over a five year period of use (1994-1998) at  the university hospital in olomouc, czech republic. the development of bacterial  resistance was linked with antibiotic use and hence selective pressure which was  specific for the type of antibiotic and the bacterial species. statistically significant correlations were found for the use of ofloxacin and resistance in escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri; cefotaxime and enterobacter cloacae; ceftazidime and acinetobacter spp., enterobacter agglomerans and proteus vulgaris; and gentamicin and proteus mirabilis.

TI  == transferable antibiotic resistance in multiresistant nosocomial acinetobacter baumannii strains from seven clinics in the slovak and czech republics.
AB  == sixty-seven multiresistant nosocomial acinetobacter baumannii isolates from patients hospitalized mostly in intensive care units of seven clinics in slovak and czech republic were tested to determine their ability to transfer antibiotic  resistance. all isolates were resistant to kanamycin, ticarcillin, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam and susceptible to carbapenems, sulbactam and  ampicillin/sulbactam. sixty-five out of 67 strains transferred resistance determinants to escherichia coli k-12 and proteus mirabilis p-38 recipients. analysis of selected transconjugants by an indirect selection method showed a more variable pattern of transferred resistance determinants. the clonal spread of strains transferring resistance seems to be an additional risk for occurrence  of strains resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam.

AB  == to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains among species of enterobacteriaceae, a microdilution susceptibility test  was performed with strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella species that were isolated as part of the sentry project. the highest percentage of esbl phenotype (defined as a minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] > or =2 microg/ml for ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, or aztreonam) was detected among k. pneumoniae strains from latin america (45%), followed by those from the western pacific region (25%), europe (23%), the united states (8%), and canada (5%). p. mirabilis and e. coli strains for which mics of  extended-spectrum cephalosporins or monobactams were elevated also were more prominent in latin america. testing with ceftazidime revealed more isolates with  elevated mics than did testing with ceftriaxone or aztreonam. esbl strains showed high levels of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. imipenem remains highly effective against esbl strains. organisms expressing an esbl are widely distributed worldwide, although prevalence rates are significantly higher in certain geographic regions.

TI  == comparison of the pr mutant with the wild-type strain of proteus mirabilis brings insight into peroxide resistance factors and regulation of catalase expression.
AB  == the peroxide resistant mutant (pr) of proteus mirabilis was characterized by an increased constitutive catalase activity concomitant with a large production of specific mrna. survival toward hydrogen peroxide during exponential phase was increased by h2o2 pretreatment in the wild type but not in the mutant, although the catalase of both strains was not inducible under these conditions. in the mutant, besides catalase, over-produced proteins comprised two different alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit c (ahpc) proteins and a protein homologous to the stationary phase transcription factor sspa of escherichia coli. conversely, the flagellin a (flaa) of p. mirabilis was repressed in the pr mutant. genomic dna fragments of 2.9 kb carrying the catalase gene (kata) together with the 5' and 3' flanking regions were isolated from both strains and found to be identical. upstream of kata, a fur box-like sequence was found, but surprisingly, restricting iron in the culture medium caused a decrease in catalase production.  the pr mutant presents similarities with other peroxide resistant mutants, but the regulation of catalase biosynthesis in p. mirabilis seems somewhat different  from other close species such as e. coli.

TI  == [the role of urinary tract infections in burn patients].
AB  == patients with burns are predisposed to a variety of infectious complications, urinary tract infections inclusive. it is the aim of the study to assay the incidence rate, etiology and antibacterial sensitivity of the leading pathogens causing bacteriuria in burnt patients, and compare them with the respective characteristics of the pathogens causing wound infection in the same contingent of patients, and urinary tract infection in uro-nephrological patients. over a five-year period, a total of 2452 urines and 4236 wound exudates from 963 patients with burns, and 8800 urines from 2908 uro-nephrological patients are studied. in 35.4 per cent of patients positivation of 29.2 per cent of the urines being examined is noted. the major causing agents producing bacteriuria in burns--e. coli (19.2%) and proteus mirabilis (13.9%)--are similar to the ones found in uro-nephrological patients, and differ from the causing agents of wound  infection (the isolates concur in 16.7 per cent of the cases only). the inference is reached that strict monitoring of burnt patients is absolutely necessary because they run a high risk of urinary infection development, most frequently caused by multiresistant hospital strains, worsening the prognosis of either of the conditions. monotherapy prescription with broad-spectrum antibacterial agents, based on the sensitivity of isolates in vitro, is strongly recommended.

TI  == an intelligent rapid odour recognition model in discrimination of helicobacter pylori and other gastroesophageal isolates in vitro.
AB  == two series of experiments are reported which result in the discrimination between helicobacter pylori and other bacterial gastroesophageal isolates using a newly developed odour generating system, an electronic nose and a hybrid intelligent odour recognition system. in the first series of experiments, after 5 h of growth (37 degrees c), 53 volatile 'sniffs' were collected over the headspace of complex broth cultures of the following clinical isolates: staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., h. pylori, enterococcus faecalis (10(7) ml(-1)), mixed infection  (proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and e. faecalis 3 x 10(6) ml each) and sterile cultures. fifty-six normalised variables were extracted from 14 conductive polymer sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer back propagation neural network (nn). the nn prediction rate achieved was 98% and the test data (37.7% of all data) was recognised correctly. successful clustering of bacterial  classes was also achieved by discriminant analysis (da) of a normalised subset of sensor data. cross-validation identified correctly seven 'unknown' samples. in the second series of experiments after 150 min of microaerobic growth at 37 degrees c, 24 volatile samples were collected over the headspace of h. pylori cultures in enriched (hpp) and normal (hp) media and 11 samples over sterile (n)  cultures. forty-eight sensor parameters were extracted from 12 sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer nn previously optimised by a genetic algorithm (ga). ga-nn analysis achieved a 94% prediction rate of 'unknown' data. additionally the 'genetically' selected 16 input neurones were used to perform da-cross validation that showed a clear clustering of three groups and reclassified correctly nine 'sniffs'. it is concluded that the most important factors that govern the performance of an intelligent bacterial odour detection system are: (a) an odour  generation mechanism, (b) a rapid odour delivery system similar to the mammalian  olfactory system, (c) a gas sensor array of high reproducibility and (d) a hybrid intelligent model (expert system) which will enable the parallel use of ga-nns and multivariate techniques.

TI  == a survey of gram-negative bacteria survival on hospital fabrics and plastics.
AB  == one critical factor for the transmission of microorganisms from person to person  or from the environment to a person (patient or health care worker) is the ability of the microbe to survive on an environmental surface. the purpose of this study was to determine the length of survival of various gram-negative bacteria on fabrics and plastics commonly used in hospitals. seven materials were tested: smooth cotton (clothing), cotton terry (towels), 60% cotton-40% polyester blend (scrub suits and lab coats), polyester (drapes), 75% nylon-25% spandex (pressure garments), polyvinyl (splash aprons), and polyurethane (keyboard covers). the following bacteria were tested: pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter species, and enterobacter species. swatches of the materials were inoculated with defined amounts of bacteria and assayed at regular intervals. survival was dependent on the bacterium, its inoculum size, and the material tested. at 102 microorganisms per swatch, bacteria survived from less than 1 hour to 8 days. at 10(4) to 10(5) bacteria per swatch, survival ranged from 2 hours to more than 60 days. these findings emphasize the need for careful disinfection and conscientious contact control procedures in areas that serve immunosuppressed individuals, such as patients with burn injuries.

TI  == resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  == multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. among gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. important causes of gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation  cephalosporin (amp c) beta-lactamase resistance among enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. in selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should  not further promote the development of resistance. recent data suggest that because of esbls and high-level amp c beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. in addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. the role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. in addition, several new agents with good  activity against gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.

AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute  otitis media are treated with antibiotics. methods: a multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. setting: nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. results: prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. cultures were negative in 60 patients. the organisms isolated  in the 92 positive cultures were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), haemophilus influenzae (four patients), proteus mirabilis (two patients), escherichia coli (two patients), klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient),  enterobacter (one patient), acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative  bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). ten patients had mixed flora. sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). conclusions: antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. the distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.

TI  == flagellin, a novel mediator of salmonella-induced epithelial activation and systemic inflammation: i kappa b alpha degradation, induction of nitric oxide synthase, induction of proinflammatory mediators, and cardiovascular dysfunction.
AB  == gram-negative sepsis is mediated by the actions of proinflammatory genes induced  in response to microbes and their products. we report that flagellin, the monomeric subunit of flagella, is a potent proinflammatory species released by salmonella. flagellin (1 microgram/ml) induces ikappabalpha degradation, nf-kappab nuclear translocation, and inducible no synthase expression in cultured intestinal epithelial cells (iec). aflagellic salmonella mutants do not induce nf-kappab activation or no production by cultured iec. antiserum to flagellin blocks no production in iec induced by medium conditioned by a variety of motile  gram-negative enteric pathogens (escherichia coli, salmonella muenchen, serratia  marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris). flagellin, when injected systemically (approximately 10 microgram/mouse), induces systemic inflammation characterized by the systemic expression of a range of proinflammatory cytokines  and chemokines and of inducible no synthase. at higher doses (approximately 300 microgram/mouse), flagellin induces shock, characterized by hypotension, reduced  vascular contractility in mice, and death. the effects of flagellin do not diminish in c3h/hej lps-resistant mice, indicating that the toll-like receptor-4  receptor is not involved in flagellin's actions. in lps-resistant mice, i.p. injection of s. dublin flagellin or medium conditioned by wild-type s. dublin induces serum ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha, whereas medium conditioned by aflagellic mutants has no effect. flagellin can be detected in the blood of rats with septic shock induced by live bacteria at approximately 1 microg/ml. we propose that flagellin released by gram-negative pathogens may contribute to the inflammatory  response by an lps- and toll-like receptor-4-independent pathway.

TI  == clostridium difficile toxins a and b can alter epithelial permeability and promote bacterial paracellular migration through ht-29 enterocytes.
AB  == clostridium difficile toxins a and b are the widely recognized etiologic agents of antibiotic-associated diseases ranging from diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis. we hypothesized that c. difficile toxins may alter intestinal epithelial permeability and facilitate bacterial penetration of the intestinal epithelial barrier. experiments were designed to clarify the effects of c. difficile toxins  a and b on the flux of inert particles across ht-29 enterocyte monolayers, and to correlate these results with bacteria-enterocyte interactions. in all experiments, mature, confluent ht-29 cultures were preincubated 16 h with toxin a or b (1-100 ng/ml). to study alterations in epithelial permeability, toxin-treated enterocytes were incubated with 5 pm solutions of 10- and 40-kd inert dextran particles. toxin a, but not toxin b, was associated with increased  dextran flux through enterocyte monolayers. to study bacteria-enterocyte interactions, toxin-treated enterocytes were incubated with 10(8) salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, or escherichia coli. although numbers of internalized bacteria were generally unaffected, both toxins were associated with increased bacterial adherence, as well as increased bacterial transmigration through enterocyte monolayers. bacterial transmigration was significantly greater using toxin a- compared to toxin b-treated enterocytes, consistent with the observation that dextran flux was significantly greater using toxin a- compared to toxin b-treated enterocytes. thus intestinal colonization with toxigenic c. difficile may facilitate bacterial penetration of the intestinal epithelium by a  mechanism involving increased permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier.

TI  == cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == in vitro activity of gatifloxacin compared with gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin, trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against uropathogens cultured from patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of gatifloxacin were compared with those of gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin, trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin using an agar dilution method for 400 uropathogens cultured from the urine of urological patients with complicated and/or hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (uti). the collection of strains was made up of enterobacteriaceae (34.5%), enterococci (31.5%), staphylococci (21.2%) and non-fermenting bacteria (12.8%). the antibacterial activity of the three newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin, were similar, but showed some drug  specific differences. gemifloxacin was most active against escherichia coli, but  less so against proteus mirabilis. in this series all isolates of e. coli were inhibited at a mic of 0.25 mg/l gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin and by 0.125 mg/l gemifloxacin. the mic distribution of all fluoroquinolones showed a bimodal distribution for staphylococci, enterococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the two modes for p. aeruginosa were 1 and 64 mg/l for gemifloxacin and moxifloxacin and  0.5 and 64 mg/l for gatifloxacin. for staphylococci the two modes were 0.125 and  2 mg/l for gatifloxacin, 0.03 and 4 mg/l for gemifloxacin, and 0.03 and 2 mg/l for moxifloxacin; for enterococci, 0.25 and 16 mg/l for gatifloxacin, 0.06 and 2  mg/l for gemifloxacin, and 0.25 and 8 mg/l for moxifloxacin. compared with trovafloxacin the mics were similar, but the newer fluoroquinolones were more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. of the newer fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin had the highest rate of renal excretion and could be considered a promising alternative fluoroquinolone agent for the treatment of uti.

TI  == integron-located veb-1 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene in a proteus mirabilis clinical isolate from vietnam.
AB  == a clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis lil-1 was obtained from a vietnamese patient hospitalized in paris, france. this isolate was resistant to cephalosporins, and there was marked synergy between cephalosporins and clavulanic acid together with unusual synergy between cefoxitin and cefuroxime. pcr analysis revealed the presence of blaveb-1, an integron-located gene coding for an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) identified previously in an escherichia coli isolate mg-1 from vietnam. using class 1 integron primers and blaveb-1 intragenic primers, the insert region of the blaveb-1-containing integron along with flanking sequences were amplified from p. mirabilis lil-1 whole-cell dna. a novel class 1 integron, in55, was identified that contained, in addition to inti1, qacedelta1, sul1 and orf5 genes, an 8 kb variable region. this region was comparable in size to that found previously in e. coli mg-1, but different from those previously identified in two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from thailand. in55 was located on a 190 kb self-transferable plasmid, which was  different in size and structure from that found in e. coli mg-1. the finding of blaveb-1 on different plasmids and integrons in enterobacterial isolates underlines the interspecies spread of this novel esbl gene.

TI  == proteus virulence: involvement of the pore forming alpha-hemolysin (a short review).
AB  == the genus proteus belongs to the tribe of proteae in the family of enterobacteriaceae, and consists of five species: p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, p. morganii, p. penneri and p. myxofaciens. they are distinguished from the rest of  enterobacteriaceae by their ability to deaminate phenylalanine and tryptophane. they hydrolyze urea and gelatin and fail to ferment lactose, mannose, dulcitol and malonate; and do not form lysine and arginine decarboxylase or beta-galactosidase [1]. colonies produce distinct "burned chocolate" odor and frequently show the characteristics of swarming motility on solid media. p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris and p. morganii are widely recognized human pathogens. they have been isolated from urinary tract infections, wounds, ear, and nosocomial bacteremic infections, often in immuncompromised patients [2-6]. p. myxofaciens has no clinical interest to this time. p. penneri as species nova was nominated by the recommendation of hickman and co-workers [7]. formerly it was recognized as p. vulgaris biogroup 1 or indole negative p. vulgaris [8, 9]. although it has been less commonly isolated from clinical samples than the other  three human pathogenic proteus species, it has nevertheless been connected with infections of the urinary tract, wounds and has been isolated from the feces of both healthy and diarrheic individuals [10-12]. potential virulence factors responsible for virulence of proteae are: iga protease, urease, type3 fimbriae associated with mr/k haemagglutinins of at least two antigenic types, endotoxin,  swarming motility and hlya and/or hpma type hemolysins [for review see ref. 13].  in the followings we give a survey of accumulated concepts about the position and characteristics of hlya type alpha-hemolysins both in general and with emphasis on virulence functions in the tribe of proteae.

TI  == functions of the subunits in the flhd(2)c(2) transcriptional master regulator of  bacterial flagellum biogenesis and swarming.
AB  == in enterobacteria like salmonella, biogenesis of cell surface flagella needed for motility is dependent upon the master operon flhdc at the apex of the flagellar gene hierarchy. the operon products flhd and flhc act together in a flhd(2)c(2 )heterotetramer to induce flagellar gene transcription, while flhd also represses cell septation. the flhdc operon is pivotal to differentiation into elongated hyperflagellated swarm cells that undergo multicellular migration, most strikingly in proteus. we set out to establish the mechanism of action of the flhd(2)c(2) multimer. in proteus swarm cell extracts, all the flhc was assembled  into the flhd(2)c(2 )transcription activator, but flhd additionally formed approximately equimolar amounts of a flhd(2) homodimer. both flhd and flhc subunits homodimerised in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that self-interactions stabilise the flhd(2)c(2 )complex. the flhc and flhd subunit proteins were separately expressed and purified, and the flhd(2)c(2)heterotetramer was reconstituted in vitro. purified flhc bound specifically and cooperatively to the promoter region of the flhdc-regulated flhb flagellar gene in the absence of flhd. purified flhd was unable to bind this target dna, but binding by the flhd(2)c(2)complex was approximately tenfold greater than the flhc subunit alone, suggesting that flhd potentiated the flhc/dna interaction. in support of this possibility, pre-incubation of flhc with flhd reduced the apparent dissociation constant, k(d), for the flhc/dna complex from 100 nm to 13 nm. furthermore, in competition assays, flhd substantially increased the specificity of dna recognition by flhc, and also stabilised the resultant labile protein/dna complex, prolonging its half-life from around two minutes to more than 40 minutes. flhd(2)c(2)is therefore an atypical prokaryotic transcription activator  in which interaction of the flhc subunit with dna target sequences is enhanced by the coexpressed helper subunit flhd.

AB  == the authors demonstrated the transferability of antibiotic resistance genes in nosocomial strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from newborn children at the paediatric university hospital in bratislava. strains were resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. the determinants of resistance (carbenicillin, cephaloridine, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam) were transferred to recipient strains of escherichia coli k-12 and proteus mirabilis p-38. the transfer of resistance determinant from donor strains was demonstrated  by the analysis of the resistance spectrum in transconjugant clones of recipient  strains by the method of indirect selection. the ability of production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) was demonstrated by the double disc diffusion test. synergy between clavulanate and cefotaxime, clavulanate and ceftazidime and/or clavulanate and aztreonam indicated production of esbl by these strains.

TI  == evaluation of the role of two conserved active-site residues in beta class glutathione s-transferases.
AB  == glutathione s-transferases (gsts) normally use hydroxy-group-containing residues  in the n-terminal domain of the enzyme for stabilizing the activated form of the  co-substrate, glutathione. however, previous mutagenesis studies have shown that  this is not true for beta class gsts and thus the origin of the stabilization remains a mystery. the recently determined crystal structure of proteus mirabilis gst b1-1 (pmgst b1-1) suggested that the stabilizing role might be fulfilled in beta class gsts by one or more residues in the c-terminal domain of the enzyme. to test this hypothesis we mutated his(106) and lys(107) of pmgst b1-1 to investigate their possible role in the enzyme's catalytic activity. his(106) was  mutated to ala, asn and phe, and lys(107) to ala and arg. the effects of the replacement on the activity, thermal stability and antibiotic-binding capacity of the enzyme were examined. the results are consistent with the involvement of his(106) and lys(107) in interacting with glutathione at the active site but these residues do not contribute significantly to catalysis, folding or antibiotic binding.

AB  == the tellurite-resistant escherichia coli strain kl53 was found during testing of  the group of clinical isolates for antibiotics and heavy metal ion resistance (burian et al. 1990). determinant of the tellurite resistance of the strain was located on the large conjugative plasmid pte53 and cloned into pacyc184. three different ter clones harboring plk2, plk18 and plk20 were isolated (burian et al. 1998). the smallest functional ter clone harboring plk18 was chosen for further analysis. plasmid plk18 have been subcloned to obtain convenient dna fragments for sequencing of tellurite-resistance determinant. sequencing of this dna fragments provided complete dna sequence of the determinant, 5,250 bp in size. the sequence has been compared with nucleotide and protein databank (blast programs) and significant homology with the three known operons coding for tellurite resistance has been found (determinat on plasmid pr478 from serratia marcescens, on plasmid pmer610 from alcaligenes sp. and chromosomal tellurite resistance genes from proteus mirabilis). we identified 5 orfs coding for 5 genes named terb to terf. the clone harboring plk18 was subjected to the transposition  with tn1737km to disrupt determinant of the tellurite resistance. plasmid dna of  several clones containing plk18 with tn1737km was isolated to locate the target site of tn1737km. analyses showed, the genes terb, terc, terd and tere are essential for conservation of the resistance whereas the gene terf is not important in this respect.

TI  == genetic characterization of dna region containing the trh and ure genes of vibrio parahaemolyticus.
AB  == we have demonstrated that possession of the gene for thermostable direct hemolysin-related hemolysin (trh) coincides with the presence of the urease gene  among clinical vibrio parahaemolyticus strains and that the location of the two genes are in close proximity on the chromosome. here, we cloned and sequenced the 15,754-bp dna region containing the trh gene and the gene cluster for urease production from the chromosome of clinical v. parahaemolyticus (th3996). we found 16 open reading frames (orfs) and a lower g+c content (41%) compared with the total genome of this bacterium (46 to 47%). the ure cluster consisted of eight genes, namely, uredabcefg and urer. urer was located 5.2 kb upstream of the other seven genes in the opposite direction. the genetic organization and sequences of  the ure genes resembled those found in proteus mirabilis. between urer and the other ure genes, there were five orfs, which are homologous with the nickel transport operon (nik) of escherichia coli. we disrupted each of the urer, urec,  and nikd genes in th3996 by homologous recombination and analyzed the phenotype of the mutants. in the presence of urea these mutant strains had dramatically less urease activity than the strain they were derived from. disruption of urer,  nikd, or urec, however, had no effect on trh production. the dna region containing the trh, nik, and ure genes was found in only trh-positive strains and not in kanagawa phenomenon-positive and environmental v. parahaemolyticus strains. at the end of the region, an insertion sequence-like element existed. these results suggest that the dna region was introduced into v. parahaemolyticus in the past through a mechanism mediated by insertion sequences. this is the first reported case that the genes for an atp-binding cassette-type nickel transport system, which may play a role in nickel transport through bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, are located adjacent to the ure cluster on the genome of an organism.

AB  == objective: this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study was conducted in europe, south africa, and australia to compare the clinical and microbiologic efficacy and the tolerability of a cephalosporin antibiotic, cefdinir, with those of cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract  infection. methods: patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 5 days of treatment with either cefdinir 100 mg bid or cefaclor 250 mg tid. results: a total of 661 patients were randomized to treatment. they were 90% female, with a  median age of 44 years. there were no clinically important differences between groups in terms of demographic characteristics or symptoms on admission. the most frequently isolated pathogens in admission urine cultures were escherichia coli (383 patients), proteus mirabilis (20 patients), staphylococcus saprophyticus (14 patients), and klebsiella pneumoniae (9 patients). of the admission pathogens with documented susceptibility results, significantly more were resistant to cefaclor (6.7%) than to cefdinir (3.7%; p < 0.003). significantly more admission  isolates of e. coli were resistant to cefaclor (5.1%) than to cefdinir (2.0%; p < 0.007). a total of 383 patients were assessable for efficacy, 196 in the cefdinir group and 187 in the cefaclor group. clinical cure rates and microbiologic response rates for cefdinir and cefaclor were statistically equivalent at 5 to 9  days posttherapy (test-of-cure visit), using a 95% ci approach. the rate of treatment-related adverse events was higher in cefdinir-treated patients (20.2%)  than in cefaclor-treated patients (13.0%; p = 0.025), mainly due to the greater frequency of diarrhea in the former group. however, only 4 patients (1.2%) discontinued cefdinir treatment due to diarrhea. conclusion: empiric therapy with cefdinir appears to be a reasonable choice for patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection in whom cephalosporin treatment is indicated.

AB  == we have investigated the mechanism of action of the cationic antimicrobial protein (18 kda) cap18 on liposomes and monolayers made from phospholipids and enterobacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps). cap18 intercalates into lipid matrices composed of lps from sensitive strains, weaker into those made of lps from a resistant strain (proteus mirabilis strain r45) or negatively charged phospholipids, but not into those composed of neutral phosphatidylcholine. from the combination of data obtained with fluorescence resonance energy transfer and  fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and film balance measurements, it can be  concluded that structural differences in the lps determine the depth of intercalation of cap18 into the respective lipid matrices. thus, we identified the l-arap4n linked to the first kdo of the lps of p. mirabilis strain r45 to be  responsible for the cap18 resistance of this strain. these data provide insight into cap18-mediated effects on the integrity of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and led to an improved model for rabbit cap18 membrane interaction.

AB  == cefditoren (formerly me-1206) is an investigational, orally administered cephalosporin ester with bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and -negative organisms. cefditoren potency against nearly 1000 non-fastidious species was determined by national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) reference broth microdilution and standardized disk diffusion methods. against staphylococci, usable cefditoren activity was completely correlated with  oxacillin with respect to potency and susceptibility interpretation (mec a-negative strains). cefditoren was very active against klebsiella spp., proteus  mirabilis, salmonella spp., and escherichia coli (mic(90) range, 0.12-1 microg/ml; median zone, 23-26 mm). cefditoren had more limited activity against citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, and indole-positive proteae (mic(50) range, 0.12-1 microg/ml; mic(90), > 16 microg/ml; median zone, 18-25 mm). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., and other non-fermentors, cefditoren was inactive (mic(90), > 16 microg/ml; zone, 6 mm). pharmacokinetic analysis of cefditoren showed that utilized dosages produce a plasma concentration that exceeds 0.5 microg/ml for 5  to 8 h and 1 microg/ml for 4 to 6 hours (t(1/2) ranges from 1.5-2 h). the following interpretive criteria were suggested: </= 2 microg/ml or >/= 15 mm (susceptible) and >/= 8 microg/ml or </= 11 mm (resistance) that yielded an intermethod categorical agreement of 95.8% and very major or major error rates of 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. alternatively, </= 1 microg/ml or >/= 18 mm (susceptible) and >/= 4 microg/ml or </= 14 mm (resistant) breakpoints resulted in 96.2% accuracy and combined serious errors of only 1.1%. cefditoren was observed to be a very active cephalosporin ranking among the most potent available orally active beta-lactams for use against a wide variety of pathogens.

TI  == respiratory pathogen colonization of the dental plaque of institutionalized elders.
AB  == although it has been established that aspiration of pharyngeal bacteria is the major route of infection in the development of nosocomial pneumonia, colonization of the pharyngeal mucosa by respiratory pathogens has been shown to be a transient phenomenon. it has been suggested that the dental plaque may constitute an additional, possibly more stable, reservoir of respiratory pathogens. the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral colonization by potential respiratory pathogens in a group of elderly (mean age = 75.9 yrs) chronic-care-facility residents (n = 28) and a group of age-, gender-, and race-matched outpatient control subjects (n = 30), with specific attention to plaque present on tooth, denture, and oral mucosal surfaces. plaque scores on teeth and dentures were significantly higher in the chronic-care-facility (ccf) subjects than in the dental outpatient control (doc) subjects (pii 2.3 vs. 1.2 and denture plaque 1.4 vs. 0.3). while no subjects in the doc group were found to be colonized with respiratory pathogens (> 1.0% of the cultivable aerobic flora), 14.3% (4/28) of the ccf subjects were found to be colonized. oral colonization with respiratory pathogens in ccf subjects was associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and higher plaque scores. these results suggest that deficient dental plaque control and the presence of copd may be related to respiratory pathogen colonization of dental plaque in chronic-care-facility residents.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in enterobacteriaceae in brooklyn, ny: epidemiology and  relation to antibiotic usage patterns.
AB  == in november 1997, all enterobacteriaceae isolated at 15 hospitals in brooklyn were collected. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were present in 44% of  409 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. six isolates had reduced susceptibility to carbapenems, including two that were not susceptible to any of the antibiotics tested. pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed a commonality of resistant isolates within and between hospitals. the occurrence of esblcontaining isolates  was associated with cephalosporin usage (p = 0.055). esbls were present in 4.7% of escherichia coli and 9.5% of proteus mirabilis isolates. it is concluded that  esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae are endemic in brooklyn, are spread between hospitals, and may be associated with cephalosporin usage.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was studied in the united states and the netherlands. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of ph on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. the mics of american and dutch isolates agreed  in general. the mics of the american gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 microg/ml, and the mics of the dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.016 to 8.0 microg/ml. a few european strains of proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high mics. bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to difloxacin. the mics of the american gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.125 to 4.0 microg/ml, and the mics of dutch isolates ranged from 0.125 to  2.0 microg/ ml. difloxacin induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0.2-3 hours in cultures with escherichia coli, staphylococcus  intermedius, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. there  was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine pseudomonas aeruginosa. decreasing the ph of the medium increased the mic of proteus mirabilis for difloxacin. the mics of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral ph and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. at a neutral ph, most tested bacterial species were killed at a difloxacin concentration of 4  times the mic. similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. a klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at difloxacin or enrofloxacin mic, but at neutral ph the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the mic for a bactericidal effect. after 24 hours of incubation at ph 7.1, difloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar bactericidal activity for all bacteria tested except staphylococcus intermedius.  against s. intermedius, difloxacin was more bactericidal than enrofloxacin.

TI  == comparative efficacy of gemifloxacin in experimental models of pyelonephritis and wound infection.
AB  == gemifloxacin (sb-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis) and gram-positive wound infection resulting from streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis or staphylococcus aureus. gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin,  grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. in the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (p < 0.01) compared with no treatment. no comparator agent  had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (p < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against e. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were  inferior (p < 0.01) against p. mirabilis infection. in the s. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (p <  0.01). results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (p > 0.05). gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (p < 0.01). no comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against s. pyogenes or s. aureus infections. these data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of  gram-negative urinary tract infection and gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.

AB  == background: the aim of the study was to evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens isolated form urinocoltures. methods: 2192 bacterial strains obtained from urine cultures with bacterial count > 100,000 ufc/ml were examined in our laboratory from july through december 1996. inpatients as well as outpatients were considered. five different ward typologies were taken into account (surgery, medicine, obstetrics, spinal unit and high risk wards). isolation frequencies were evaluated for each ward, but in order to get an adequate statistical sample they were divided into in two categories, e.g. strains isolated from inpatients and from outpatients. antibiotic susceptibility  was also evaluated dividing the data into the same two categories. for strains isolated with lower frequencies that was not possible, and data from inpatients were grouped with data from outpatients. results: the results obtained show that  bacterial species most frequently isolated among inpatients are escherichia coli  (45.7%), enterococcus faecalis (16.8%), proteus mirabilis (9.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%). those most frequently isolated among outpatients are escherichia coli (58.1%), enterococcus faecalis (12.3%), proteus mirabilis (9.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (4.4%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (4.0%). as far as antibiotic susceptibility is concerned,  whenever a statistically significant difference in sensitivity could be observed  between strains isolated from inpatients and strains isolated from outpatients, sensitivity was always higher for outpatients strains. conclusions: isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility are different depending on the place of origin of the patients (inpatients/outpatients). this implies a different approach to the empiric therapy in urinary tract infections.

TI  == occurrence and detection of ampc beta-lactamases among escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolates at a veterans medical center.
AB  == ampc beta-lactamases are cephalosporinases that confer resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactam drugs and that may thereby create serious therapeutic problems. although reported with increasing frequency, the true rate of occurrence of ampc beta-lactamases in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis remains unknown. we tested a total of 1,286 consecutive, nonrepeat isolates of these three species and found that, overall, 45 (3.5%) yielded a cefoxitin zone diameter less than 18 mm (screen positive) and that 16 (1.2%) demonstrated ampc bands by isoelectric focusing. based on the species, of  683 e. coli, 371 k. pneumoniae, and 232 p. mirabilis isolates tested, 13 (1.9%),  28 (7.6%), and 4 (1.7%), respectively, demonstrated decreased zone diameters and  11 (1.6%), 4 (1.1%), and 1 (0.4%), respectively, demonstrated ampc bands. cefoxitin resistance was transferred for all but 8 (e. coli) of the 16 ampc producers. we also describe a three-dimensional extract test, which was used to detect phenotypically isolates that harbor ampc beta-lactamase. of the 45 cefoxitin-resistant isolates, the three-dimensional extract test accurately identified all 16 ampc producers and 28 of 29 (97%) isolates as non-ampc producers. interestingly, most (86%) isolates in the latter group were k. pneumoniae isolates. these data confirm that, at our institution, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis harbor plasmid-mediated ampc enzymes.

TI  == frequency and time course of pancreatic and extrapancreatic bacterial infection in experimental acute pancreatitis in rats.
AB  == background: infectious complications in severe pancreatitis are the main factors  determining clinical course and outcome. the taurocholate model for acute necrotizing pancreatitis was evaluated for frequency and time course of pancreatic and extrapancreatic bacterial infection. methods: sixty-five male wistar rats were divided into 5 groups of 13 animals each. specimens for bacteriologic examination were taken, and pancreatitis was induced by intraductal infusion of 3% taurocholate under sterile conditions. animals were killed 8, 16,  24, or 32 hours thereafter, and bacteriologic examination was performed. a control group of animals with intraductal infusion of 0.9% saline solution were killed after 32 hours. results: there was no significant pancreatic infection in  the control group and in the 8-hour group (1 of 13 rats). sixteen and 24 hours after induction of pancreatitis, infection and inflammation of the pancreas were  found in 77% (10 of 13 rats), and after 32 hours pancreatic infection occurred in 69% (9 of 13 rats). extrapancreatic bacterial infection after 16 hours occurred in the liver (62%), spleen (62%), and mesenteric lymph nodes (46%). bacteria infecting the pancreas reflected the bacterial spectrum of the large bowel and terminal ileum before induction of pancreatitis (escherichia coli [77%], proteus  [43%], enterococcus [37%], and staphylococcus [23%]). conclusions: pancreatic infection is an early and frequent finding in the taurocholate model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. infection occurs between 8 and 16 hours after induction of pancreatitis. the source of infecting bacteria seems to be the large bowel or  the terminal ileum. we present a useful model of severe pancreatitis in which to  study bacterial translocation, the further route of spread, and therapeutic approaches.

TI  == h-ns is a repressor of the proteus mirabilis urease transcriptional activator gene urer.
AB  == expression of proteus mirabilis urease is governed by urer, an arac-like positive transcriptional activator. a poly(a) tract nucleotide sequence, consisting of a(6)ta(2)ca(2)tggta(5)ga(6)tga(5), is located 16 bp upstream of the sigma(70)-like urer promoter p2. since poly(a) tracts of dna serve as binding sites for the gene repressor histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (h-ns), we measured beta-galactosidase activity of wild-type escherichia coli mc4100 (h-ns(+)) and its isogenic derivative atm121 (hns::tn10) (h-ns(-)) harboring a urer-lacz operon fusion plasmid (plc9801). beta-galactosidase activity in the h-ns(-) host strain was constitutive and sevenfold greater (p < 0.0001) than that in the h-ns(+) host. a recombinant plasmid containing cloned p. mirabilis hns was able to complement and restore repression of the urer promoter in the h-ns(-) host when provided in trans. deletion of the poly(a) tract nucleotide sequence from plc9801 resulted in an increase in beta-galactosidase activity in the h-ns(+) host to nearly the same levels as that observed for wild-type plc9801 harbored by the h-ns(-) host. urease activity in strains harboring the recombinant plasmid pmid1010 (encoding the entire urease gene cluster of p. mirabilis) was equivalent in both the h-ns(-) background and the h-ns(+) background in the presence of urea but was eightfold greater (p = 0.0001) in the  h-ns(-) background in the absence of urea. we conclude that h-ns represses urer expression in the absence of urea induction.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacterial strains isolated from adults with community-acquired urinary tract infections (uti) in france. from december 1996 to march 1997, each of 15 private laboratories in france consecutively collected  about 80 non-duplicate strains isolated from adult outpatients with uti, including patients receiving care at home, and tested their susceptibility by the disk diffusion test. a total of 1160 strains were collected: 1031 gram-negative bacilli, including escherichia coli (n = 865), proteus mirabilis (n = 68) and klebsiella spp. (n = 40), and 129 gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus aureus (n = 16), other staphylococci (n = 25), group b streptococci (n = 25) and  enterococci (n = 63). in the case of 430 bacterial isolates, the patients had either been hospitalised in the last 6 months or received antibiotic treatment in the last 3 months. the antibiotic susceptibility rates for escherichia coli were: amoxicillin (58.7%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (63.3%), ticarcillin (61.4%), cephalothin (66.8%) cefuroxime (77.6%), cefixime (83.6%), cefotaxime (99.8%), ceftazidime (99%), nalidixic acid (91.9%), norfloxacin (96.6%), ofloxacin (96.3%), ciprofloxacin (98.3%), cotrimoxazole (78.2%), fosfomycin (99.1%) and gentamicin (98.4%). of the enterobacteriaceae, five strains produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. methicillin resistance was detected in nine staphylococcus aureus isolates. the most important findings were two extended-spectrum, beta-lactamase-producing and three methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients who had not been hospitalised in the last 6 months or taken antibiotics in the last 3 months. the  findings indicate that these strains can spread within the community; therefore,  monitoring antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the community appears to be mandatory.

AB  == the aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy in terms of mortality and long-term morbidity of third generation cephalosporins and amikacin in combination for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial meningitis in a homogeneous group of neonates. a 15-year experience (1983-1997) with 72 term neonates without central nervous system anomalies and with gram-negative organisms grown in their cerebrospinal fluid treated with the above combination of antibiotics is presented. all isolated organisms were sensitive to cefotaxime  or ceftazidime and to amikacin but 80% were resistant to ampicillin. the predominant infecting organism was escherichia coli (68.0%) which was sensitive to both cefotaxime and amikacin in all cases but resistant to ampicillin in 48% of cases. survival at discharge was 97.2% but ultimate survival was reduced to 94.4%, as 2 patients died a few months following discharge of conditions unrelated to meningitis. ventriculitis was diagnosed in 10 neonates (13.8%). among survivors, 1 neonate (1.3%) developed hydrocephalus needing shunting and 1  neonate (1.3%) with proteus mirabilis developed a brain abscess with relapse of meningitis which was successfully treated with a 6-week course of chloramphenicol. at follow-up at an age greater than 6 months, 91.1% of the surviving infants were normal, while 92.3% of survivors at an age greater than 6  years were normal and attended normal school. these results, despite any reservations due to the nature of the study (retrospective, uncontrolled study),  strongly support the use of third generation cephalosporins and amikacin in combination for the treatment of neonatal gram-negative bacterial meningitis.

TI  == comparable endotoxic properties of lipopolysaccharides are manifest in diverse clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == in general there is a poor correlation between serum lipopolysaccharide (lps; the biologically active constituent of endotoxin) levels and mortality in septic patients. the objective of this study was to determine if chemical, structural, or biological differences among lps from different clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria might explain this discrepancy. lps preparations were made using the hot phenol-water extraction method from eight clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria. as a percentage of the total weight of the lps, the phosphate content ranged from 3.0 to 13.8% (average, 6.7 +/- 3.6%), and the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate content ranged from 1.9 to 27.4% (average, 8.9 +/- 8.5%).  these values were not dissimilar to those obtained for a reference endotoxin. in  a standard measure of lps activity, the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay, there was approximately a twofold difference between the least and most active preparations. the two preparations with the greatest difference in their ability  to elicit the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha from a mouse peritoneal macrophage cell line were similar in lethality when administered to mice sensitized to the effects of lps by d(+)-galactosamine. these relatively minor differences in lps activity seem unlikely to explain the generally observed discrepancy between serum endotoxin levels and mortality in patients with gram-negative sepsis.

(p. mirabilis 25 strains and p. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (isp), amikacin (amk), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against p. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. isp was effective against all strains except for 14% of mrsa, 2% of proteus sp., and 4% of p. aeruginosa. 2. six strains of mrsa were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases isp exhibited a relatively  low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) compared to the other compounds. 3. four strains of mrsa were resistant to all drugs except isp. mrsa was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. twenty-one strains of mrsa and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both isp and amk. 5. against all strains tested, isp generally exhibited a lower mic compared to amk. these results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, isp is still an aminoglycoside having a  high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == investigation of plants used in jamaican folk medicine for anti-bacterial activity.
AB  == we have started a systematic scientific study of folklore medicinal plants currently used as alternative medicine in jamaican society. in this initial study, extracts of plants widely used by the islanders are studied for antibacterial activity against five common pathogens; streptococcus group a, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia  coli. these studies revealed that 25% (approx.) of the plant extracts had antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes used. subsequent to these observations, extracts from mikania micrantha were examined in detail. this led to the isolation of two sesquiterpenoids, mikanolide and dihydromikanolide, with activity against s. aureus and c. albicans. the results suggest that traditional folk medicine could be used as a guide in our continuing search for new natural products with potential medicinal properties.

TI  == biochemical sequence analyses of ges-1, a novel class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and the class 1 integron in52 from klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae ori-1 was isolated in 1998 in france from a rectal swab of  a 1-month-old girl who was previously hospitalized in cayenne hospital, cayenne,  french guiana. this strain harbored a ca. 140-kb nontransferable plasmid, ptk1, that conferred an extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance profile antagonized  by the addition of clavulanic acid, tazobactam, or imipenem. the gene for ges-1 (guiana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) was cloned, and its protein was expressed in escherichia coli dh10b, where this pi-5. 8 beta-lactamase of a ca. 31-kda molecular mass conferred resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins (mostly to  ceftazidime). ges-1 is weakly related to the other plasmid-located ambler class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). the highest percentage of amino acid identity was obtained with the carbenicillinase gn79 from proteus mirabilis; with yent, a chromosome-borne penicillinase from yersinia enterocolitica; and with l-2, a chromosome-borne class a cephalosporinase from stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36% amino acid identity each). however, a dendrogram analysis showed that ges-1 clustered within a class a esbl subgroup together with esbls veb-1 and per-1. sequencing of a 7,098-bp dna fragment from plasmid ptk1 revealed that the  ges-1 gene was located on a novel class 1 integron named in52 that was characterized by (i) a 5' conserved segment containing an inti1 gene possessing two putative promoters, p(1) and p(2), for coordinated expression of the downstream antibiotic resistance genes and an atti1 recombination site; (ii) five antibiotic gene cassettes, bla(ges-1), aac(6')ib' (gentamicin resistance and amikacin susceptibility), dfrxvb (trimethoprim resistance), a novel chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmla4), and aada2 (streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance); and (iii) a 3' conserved segment consisting of qacedelta1 and suli.  the bla(ges-1) and aada2 gene cassettes were peculiar, since they lacked a typical 59-base element. this work identified the second class a esbl gene of a non-tem, non-shv series which was located in the plasmid and integron, thus providing it additional means for its spread and its expression.

AB  == the saccharide constituents of lipopolysaccharides (lps) of proteus spp. vary with the strain and contain unique components about which little is known. the biological activities of lps and lipid a from s- and r-forms of 10 proteus strains were examined. lps from all s-form proteus strains was lethal to d-(+)-galactosamine (galn)-loaded, lps-responsive, c3h/hen mice, but not to lps-hypo-responsive c3h/hej mice. p. vulgaris 025 lps evoked strong anaphylactoid reactions in n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (mdp)-primed c3h/hej mice. lps from s- and r-form proteus strains induced production of nitric oxide (no) and tumour necrosis factor (tnf) by macrophages isolated from c3h/hen but not c3h/hej mice. lipid a from proteus strains also induced no and tnf production, although lipid a was less potent than lps. the effects of lps were mainly dependent on cd14; lps-induced no and tnf production in cd14+ j774.1 cells was significantly greater than in cd14-j7.def.3 cells. all lps from proteus strains,  and especially from p. vulgaris 025, exhibited higher anti-complementary activity than lps from escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa. polymyxin b inactivated proteus lps in a dose-dependent manner, but these lps preparations were more resistant to polymyxin b than e. coli lps. cap18(109-135), a granulocyte-derived  peptide, inhibited proteus lps endotoxicity only when the lps:cap18(109-135) ratio was appropriate, which suggests that cap18(109-135) acts through a different mechanism than polymyxin b. the results indicate that lps from proteus  spp. are potently endotoxic, but that the toxicity is different from that of lps  from e. coli or salmonella spp. and even varies among different proteus strains.  the variation in biological activities among proteus lps may be due to unique components within the respective lps.

TI  == pcr studies on the presence of chlamydia trachomatis in the upper urinary tract of patients with obstructive pyelonephritis.
AB  == chlamydia trachomatis infections are among the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the world and it is only logical to hypothesize that it alone or in association with mycoplasmas can participate in the initiation and persistence of upper urinary tract infections. having in mind the inconclusive evidence regarding the role of c. trachomatis in upper urinary tract infections we decided to study the presence of c. trachomatis in the upper urinary tract of patients with obstructive pyelonephritis using the polymerase chain reaction. we studied 20 patients (12 female and 8 male, aged 20-60 years) with symptoms and signs of acute pyelonephritis in accordance with kunin's criteria (1997). samples were taken during surgery of the upper urinary tract by aspirating urine from the renal pelvis or the ureter above the level of the obstruction and analyzed for the presence of bacterial pathogens using routine microbiological techniques and  employing the "amplicor ct/ng" test (roche diagnostic systems, branchburg, nj, usa) for the presence of c. trachomatis. chlamydia trachomatis was found in the aspirated urine of 5 patients (25%). in 3 of the patients the microbiological tests of the aspirated urine did not establish any other microbial agent. in the  other two escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were cultured. the analysis of the clinical and laboratory findings in the patients with chlamydia trachomatis infection alone and those with an associated bacterial pathogen failed to reach statistical significance. following the operation all of the patients received treatment with ofloxacin 200 mg bid for 7 days with a favorable clinical and laboratory outcome. in our opinion, the amplicor ct/ng test is a sensitive and specific method for diagnosing low-number chlamydia trachomatis infections of the upper urinary tract in patients with obstructive pyelonephritis. chlamydia trachomatis should be considered as a possible etiologic agent in acute pyelonephritis and the therapeutic regimen in such patients should be targeted at its possible underlying presence.

AB  == in hiv-1 infected patients severe enteritis and chronic diarrhea are often documented as a consequence of multiple opportunistic infections. we analyzed 48  hiv-1 positive patients for the presence of intestinal pathogenic protozoa. patients with cd4 > or = 200/mm3 showed a higher prevalence of a single pathogenic protozoa than patients with cd4 < or =200/mm3, who showed the presence of multiple protozoal infections. patients who proved positive for only a single  protozoa, cryptosporidium or blastocystis, were also positive, by stool culture,  for the presence of proteus mirabilis (3 samples), citrobacter freundii (3 samples), escherichia coli (one sample) or enterobacter cloacae (one sample). treatment with rifaximin (600 mg, 3 times a day, for 14 days) was efficacious in  resolving the clinical symptoms and clearing protozoan infections in hiv-1 infected patients with cd4 > or = 200/mm3, who presented enteric and systemic symptoms due to criptosporidium or blastocystis associated with enteropathogenic  bacteria.

TI  == interactions of "limax amoebae" and gram-negative bacteria: experimental studies  and review of current problems.
AB  == free-living amoebae can harbour bacteria inside their cysts giving them a microhabitat and protecting them from disinfectants. the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential importance of "limax amoebae" as vectors for environmental and nosocomial bacteria in a hospital. it was shown that free-living amoebae are  ubiquitous in the investigated hospital, occur syntopically with facultative human pathogens (comamonas acidovorans and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and may serve  as hosts not only for these but also for bacteria isolated from clinical specimens (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa); temperature is apparently of crucial importance for the interactions between these microorganisms. recent studies have shown that "limax amoebae" apart from acting as protective hosts, may also play a role for the thermotolerance, invasiveness and antibiotic-resistance of bacteria. considering also the reduced  immune-status of many patients, this "symbiosis" of free-living amoebae and bacteria might still be of underestimated hospital-hygienic importance.

AB  == background: to assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm) in adult postneurosurgical patients. methods: thirty adult patients with gnbm were included in this study. their clinical features, laboratory data, prognostic factors, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. the patients were 22 males and 8 females, aged 17-72 years. seven  had community-acquired infections and 23 had nosocomial infections. two patients  were associated with brain abscess. results: the pathogens found in the 30 gnbm patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella species, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, and some rare pathogens including citrobacter freundii,  serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. among these 30  patients, 8 patients with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant gnbm were identified since 1994; all infections were nosocomially acquired. appropriate antibiotics were given to 22 patients. eight patients did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. all eight died. the mortality rate in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 14%. conclusions: there has been an increase of gnbm  in postneurosurgical patients in recent years. in addition, the emergence of strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in this specific group of patients has also been noted in recent years, and has become a great therapeutic  challenge. we noted many prognostic factors in postneurosurgical patients in this study; however, appropriate antibiotic therapy and initial consciousness level are the most significant ones. therefore, in cases of postneurosurgical patients  with nosocomially acquired gnbm, the possibility of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be strongly suspected. early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed in this potentially fatal disease.

TI  == molecular recognition of synthetic siderophore analogues: a study with receptor-deficient and fhu(a-b) deletion mutants of escherichia coli.
AB  == the biological activity of six synthetic siderophore analogues (two dihydroxamates, two trihydroxamates, one tetrahydroxamate and one 3-hydroxy-4(1h)pyridinone) has been studied in escherichia coli, morganella morganii 13 and proteus mirabilis 8993 strains by using growth promotion tests. various transport-deficient mutants of e. coli were used to study the route of entry into gram-negative bacteria. the results indicated that the synthetic hydroxamate compounds are transported via fhu-mediated transport systems, although receptor specificity was low. this could be proven by using a delta (fhua-b) e. coli mutant as a control in which growth promotion by natural hydroxamates was completely abolished, suggesting that a periplasmic binding-protein-dependent transport system (fhub, c, d) is required for the transport of all synthetic ferric hydroxamate complexes. although utilization of  the synthetic hydroxamates was generally lower than that of the natural siderophores, differences in growth promotion could be detected. highest activity was observed with the dihydroxamate docydhama ligand which supported growth at concentrations < 1 mm. in comparison with other polyamino-polyhydroxamate ligands studied, this dihydroxamate ligand has an extra diamide backbone that could be important for the interaction with the receptors or with fhud. the synthetic trihydroxamate and tetrahydroxamate ligands showed a relatively low siderophore activity. studies with proteus and morganella in the presence of increasing bipyridyl concentrations showed a decreased growth promotion with the synthetic ferric hydroxamates, suggesting the involvement of a reduction step during iron mobilization or an increased toxicity of bipyridyl. this was not observed in the  case of the 3-hydroxy-4(1h)pyridinone where bipyridyl had no effect.

AB  == background: clostridium difficile can be recovered from many high-risk hospitalized patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. clostridium difficile toxins a and b have been associated with increased intestinal permeability in vitro and there is growing evidence that increased intestinal permeability may be a common mechanism whereby enteric bacteria penetrate the intestinal epithelium. hypothesis: clostridium difficile-induced alterations in the intestinal barrier facilitate microbial penetration of the intestinal epithelium, which in turn facilitates the translocation of intestinal bacteria. design: mature caco-2 enterocytes were pretreated with varying concentrations of  toxin a or toxin b followed by 1 hour of incubation with pure cultures of either  salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, or proteus mirabilis. the effects of toxins a and b on enterocyte viability, cytoskeletal actin, and ultrastructural topography were assessed using vital dyes, fluorescein-labeled phalloidin, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. the toxins' effects on bacterial adherence and bacterial internalization by cultured enterocytes were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative culture, respectively. epithelial permeability was assessed by changes in transepithelial electrical resistance and by quantifying paracellular bacterial movement through caco-2 enterocytes cultivated on permeable supports. results: neither toxin a nor toxin  b had a measurable effect on the numbers of enteric bacteria internalized by caco-2 enterocytes; however, both toxins were associated with alterations in enterocyte actin, decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and increased  bacterial adherence and paracellular transmigration. conclusion: clostridium difficile toxins a or b may facilitate bacterial adherence and penetration of the intestinal epithelial barrier.

TI  == characteristics of pathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitals in north america: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is common and involves pathogens with changing susceptibility patterns. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program evaluates  international pathogen incidence patterns to detect and manage the emergence of resistant strains. we describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns among 1617 pathogens recovered from utis during the third-quarter of 1997 in north america (united states and canada), as part of this worldwide program. the isolates were  tested against more than 50 antimicrobial agents (20 reported) by reference broth microdilution methods, and selected isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and automated ribotyping. the five most frequently isolated species were escherichia coli (48.6%), enterococcus spp. (13.7%), klebsiella spp. (12.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%), and enterobacter spp. or  proteus mirabilis (3.8% each). for each nation, imipenem and cefepime produced the widest spectrum of coverage among the beta-lactams and amikacin was best among the aminoglycosides. for gram-negative species, high resistance among beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was noted especially for various penicillins against e. coli (37.9% to 42.8%) and for the cephalosporins tested against enterococci (99.4% and 100%). approximately 7.0% of enterococci in the usa were vancomycin-resistant (88% with van a). p. aeruginosa provided the most consistent levels of resistance, but the following agents were most active against these organisms: amikacin (96.6 to 97.4% susceptible), tobramycin (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin (89.5 to 96.6%), imipenem  (89.7 to 92.1%), cefepime (77.6 to 89.7%), and ceftazidime (82.9 to 86.2%). e. coli (2.2 to 2.7%), k. pneumoniae (6.2 to 6.4%), and a single enterobacter cloacae strain produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; and five other enterobacter spp. were likely to have expressed chromosomally mediated (amp c) stably derepressed cephalosporinases with associated resistance to ceftazidime (16.7 to 21.2% resistance). these data demonstrated that several uti isolates in  sentry hospitals have high levels of resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents with little evidence of clonal dissemination.

AB  == the mechanism of interaction of the cationic antimicrobial protein (18 kda), cap18, with the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria was investigated applying transmission electron microscopy and voltage-clamp techniques on artificial planar bilayer membranes. electron micrographs of bacterial cells exposed to cap18 showed damage to the outer membrane of the sensitive escherichia coli strains f515 and atcc 11775, whereas the membrane of the resistant proteus mirabilis strain r45 remained intact. electrical measurements on various planar asymmetric bilayer membranes, one side consisting of a phospholipid mixture and the other of different phospholipids or of lipopolysaccharide (reconstitution model of the outer membrane), yielded information about the influence of cap18 on membrane integrity. addition of cap18 to the side with the varying lipid composition led to lipid-specific adsorption of cap18 and subsequent induction of current fluctuations due to the formation of transient membrane lesions at a lipid-specific clamp voltage. we propose that the applied clamp voltage leads to  reorientation of cap18 molecules adsorbed to the bilayer into an active transmembrane configuration, allowing the formation of lesions by multimeric clustering.

AB  == in cell-free pseudomonas aeruginosa culture supernatants, we identified two compounds capable of activating an n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) biosensor. mass spectrometry and nmr spectroscopy revealed that these compounds were not ahls but the diketopiperazines (dkps), cyclo(deltaala-l-val) and cyclo(l-pro-l-tyr) respectively. these compounds were also found in cell-free supernatants from proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter agglomerans [cyclo(deltaala-l-val) only]. although both dkps were absent from pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas alcaligenes, we isolated, from both pseudomonads, a third dkp, which was chemically characterized as cyclo(l-phe-l-pro). dose-response curves using a luxr-based ahl biosensor indicated that cyclo(deltaala-l-val), cyclo(l-pro-l-tyr) and cyclo(l-phe-l-pro) activate the biosensor in a concentration-dependent manner, albeit at much higher concentrations than the natural activator n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone  (3-oxo-c6-hsl). competition studies showed that cyclo(deltaala-l-val), cyclo(l-pro-l-tyr) and cyclo(l-phe-l-pro) antagonize the 3-oxo-c6-hsl-mediated induction of bioluminescence, suggesting that these dkps may compete for the same luxr-binding site. similarly, dkps were found to be capable of activating or antagonizing other luxr-based quorum-sensing systems, such as the n-butanoylhomoserine lactone-dependent swarming motility of serratia liquefaciens. although the physiological role of these dkps has yet to be established, their activity suggests the existence of cross talk among bacterial  signalling systems.

TI  == [development of a vaccine for treatment of urinary tract infections].
AB  == receiving uroinfections are predominantly treated with antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. an effective alternative treatment can be immunotherapy with inactivated bacteria. the authors have focused on the development of polybacterial vaccine with both specific and nonspecific immunostimulatory activity. the vaccine contains killed bacteria which most frequently occur as an  etiological agent in urinary tract infections. determining for the selection of particular strains for the vaccine preparation were their immunostimulatory properties evaluated after intraperitoneal application of killed cells to mice. the results were evaluated according to weight gain of liver and spleen and verified by histological examination of these organs. the final form of the vaccine urvakol contains immunogenically most active strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, representing specific effective part of the preparation, adjuvant activity is provided by propionibacterium acnes.

TI  == paediatric nosocomial urinary tract infection at a regional hospital.
AB  == from a total of 26,603 admissions to the paediatric wards, 1360 paediatric nosocomial urinary tract infections (pnuti) were identified during a 5-year retrospective chart review at the sfgh. the ages ranged from 3 days to 13 years,  with 46% boys and 54% girls. the highest rates of pnuti per service per 100 admissions were seen in the nursery (11.28) followed by paediatric surgery (2.89) and paediatric medicine (2.86). although the greatest number of pnuti occurred in the nursery, comparison between the years was not statistically significant. about 90% (1218 of 1360) of pnuti occurred in catheterized patients. no documentation was found specifying the type of catheterization (intermittent or continuous). about 90% (1210 of 1360) of isolates were single organisms with escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and group b streptococci accounting for a total of approximately 70% of all pathogens. however, the composition of the most common isolate in each service differed. the most common  isolate in the nursery was e. coli, in the paediatric medical and surgical services the most common isolates were klebsiella spp. and proteus mirabilis, respectively. proteus mirabilis was isolated predominantly from boys with structural abnormality of the urethral tract. no pnutis were complicated by bacteraemia. the antibiotics with least effectiveness (in increasing order) for utis were cephalexin, ampicillin, trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole and tetracycline.  the most effective antibiotics were nalidixic acid, gentamicin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

TI  == antibacterial effects of lactoferricin b.
AB  == the antimicrobial peptide, lactoferricin, can be generated upon gastric pepsin cleavage of lactoferrin. we have examined the inhibitory efficacy of lactoferricin of bovine origin (lf-cin b) on escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis  and staphylococcus aureus with or without a cell wall. we found that spheroplasts and protoplasts had a lower mic than their counterparts with a cell wall. we also compared the efficacies of lf-cin b (17-31) made of all l-amino acids and all d-amino acids. the peptide made of all d-amino acids was more active than the corresponding l-enantiomer. furthermore, we examined the influence of lf-cin b on the motility of e. coli and the influence of temperature on the susceptibility of bacteria exposed to lf-cin b. bacteria exposed to sub-mic of lf-cin b lost their  motility. bacteria exposed to lf-cin b at 20 degrees c were more sensitive to lf-cin b than when exposed at 37 degrees c. these findings indicate that the cell envelope is a limiting step for lf-cin b to exert its antibiotic effect. we cannot rule out a receptor-mediated first step for lf-cin b (17-31).

TI  == evidence that patients with rheumatoid arthritis have asymptomatic 'non-significant' proteus mirabilis bacteriuria more frequently than healthy controls.
AB  == objectives: patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) are reported to have in their sera raised levels of antibody specific to proteus mirabilis. the aim of the study was to verify this and to determine an explanation for it by investigating  the frequency of p. mirabilis urinary tract infection in ra patients and matched  controls. methods: freshly voided urine was examined for the presence, number and identity of infecting bacteria. the levels of antibody in blood and in urine of the igm, iga and igg classes to the common o serotypes of p. mirabilis and the antigens to which they reacted were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and immunoblotting. results: analysis of urine from 76 patients with ra and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy controls showed that only two (4%) of the control urines but 25 (33%) of those from the ra patients were infected. the commonest infecting organism in the ra patients' urine was proteus mirabilis  which occurred twice as frequently as escherichia coli. proteus mirabilis was found in 52% of the infected urines of the ra patients and was always detected as a pure growth and usually in insignificant (< 10(4)/ml) numbers. it is highly improbable that this finding was the outcome of differences in age, physical ability or medication between the ra and control patient groups. comparison of antibody levels to p. mirabilis by elisa showed ra patients had raised (p < 0.0001, p = 0.001, p = 0.0063) levels of iga, igg and igm respectively in their sera and raised (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p = 0.0001) levels of igg, igm and iga respectively in their urine compared with the control group. it was not possible  to detect an antibody reacting to a p. mirabilis antigen that was specific to the ra patients. conclusion: the results confirm that ra patients have raised levels  of antibody to p. mirabilis not only in blood but also in urine and suggest that  this arises because ra patients have an asymptomatic, non-significant p. mirabilis bacteriuria more frequently or more prolonged than control patients. this may be the trigger for their ra condition.

TI  == requirement of mrph for mannose-resistant proteus-like fimbria-mediated hemagglutination by proteus mirabilis.
AB  == two new genes, mrph and mrpj, were identified downstream of mrpg in the mrp gene  cluster encoding mannose-resistant proteus-like (mr/p) fimbriae of uropathogenic  proteus mirabilis. since the predicted mrph has 30% amino acid sequence identity  to papg, the galalpha(1-4)gal-binding adhesin of escherichia coli p fimbriae, we  hypothesized that mrph encodes the functional mr/p hemagglutinin. mr/p fimbriae,  expressed in e. coli dh5alpha, conferred on bacteria both the ability to cause mannose-resistant hemagglutination and the ability to aggregate to form pellicles on the broth surface. both a deltamrph mutant expressed in e. coli dh5alpha and an isogenic mrph::apha mutant of p. mirabilis were unable to produce normal mr/p  fimbriae efficiently, suggesting that mrph was involved in fimbrial assembly. amino acid residue substitution of the n-terminal cysteine residues (c66s and c128s) of mrph abolished the receptor-binding activity (hemagglutinating ability) of mrph but allowed normal fimbrial assembly, supporting the notion that mrph was the functional mr/p hemagglutinin. immunogold electron microscopy of p. mirabilis hi4320 revealed that mrph was located at the tip of mr/p fimbriae, also consistent with its role in receptor binding. the isogenic mrph::apha mutant of hi4320 was less able to colonize the urine, bladder, and kidneys in a mouse model of ascending urinary tract infection (p < 0.01), and therefore mr/p fimbriae contribute significantly to bacterial colonization in mice. while there are similarities between p. mirabilis mr/p and e. coli p fimbriae, there are more notable differences: (i) synthesis of the mrph adhesin is required to initiate fimbrial assembly, (ii) mr/p fimbriae confer an aggregation phenotype, (iii) site-directed mutation of specific residues can abolish receptor binding but allows fimbrial assembly, and (iv) mutation of the adhesin gene abolishes virulence in a mouse model of ascending urinary tract infection.

TI  == substrate-specific binding of hook-associated proteins by flgn and flit, putative chaperones for flagellum assembly.
AB  == during flagellum assembly by motile enterobacteria, flagellar axial proteins destined for polymerization into the cell surface structure are thought to be exported through the 25-30 a flagellum central channel as partially unfolded monomers. how are premature folding and oligomerization in the cytosol prevented? we have shown previously using hyperflagellated proteus mirabilis and a motile but non-swarming flgn transposon mutant that the apparently cytosolic 16. 5 kda flagellar protein flgn facilitates efficient flagellum filament assembly. here, we investigate further whether flgn, predicted to contain a c-terminal amphipathic helix typical of type iii export chaperones, acts as a chaperone for  axial proteins. incubation of soluble radiolabelled flgn from salmonella typhimurium with nitrocellulose-immobilized cell lysates of wild-type s. typhimurium and a non-flagellate class 1 flhdc mutant indicated that flgn binds to flagellar proteins. identical affinity blot analysis of culture supernatants from the wild-type and flhdc, flgi, flgk, flgl, flic or flid flagellar mutants showed that flgn binds to the flagellar hook-associated proteins (haps) flgk and  flgl. this was confirmed by blotting artificially expressed individual haps in escherichia coli. analysis of axial proteins secreted into the culture medium by  the original p. mirabilis flgn mutant demonstrated that export of flgk and flgl was specifically reduced, with concomitant increased release of unpolymerized flagellin (flic), the immediately distal component of the flagellum. these data suggest that flgn functions as an export chaperone for flgk and flgl. parallel experiments showed that flit, a similarly small (14 kda), potentially helical flagellar protein, binds specifically to the flagellar filament cap protein, flid (hap2), indicating that it too might be an export chaperone. flagellar axial proteins all contain amphipathic helices at their termini. removal of the hap c-terminal helical domains abolished binding by flgn and flit in each case, and polypeptides comprising each of the hap c-termini were specifically bound by flgn and flit. we suggest that flgn and flit are substrate-specific flagellar chaperones that prevent oligomerization of the haps by binding to their helical domains before export.

AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 560 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 hospitals during the period of june 1997 to may 1998. of the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were escherichia coli. susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc) showed the highest activity against e. faecalis isolated from patients with utis. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. imipenem (ipm) and vancomycin (vcm) were also active with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. the others had low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa vcm and arbekacin (abk) showed the highest activities against both s. aureus and mrsa isolated from patients with utis. the  mic90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. the others except minocycline (mino) had low  activities with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. more than a half of s. aureus strains (including mrsa) showed high susceptibilities to gentamicin (gm) and mino, the mic50s of 0.25 microgram/ml or 0.5 microgram/ml. 3. enterobacter cloacae ipm showed the highest activity against e. cloacae. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. the mic90s of ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and tosufloxacin (tflx) were 1 microgram/ml, the mic90s of amikacin (amk)  and ofloxacin (oflx) were 4 micrograms/ml, the mic90 of gm was 16 micrograms/ml.  among e. cloacae strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones have decreased in 1997, compared with those in 1996. but the other drugs were not so active in 1997 as 1996. 4. escherichia coli all drugs except penicillins were active against e. coli with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. particularly, flomoxef (fmox), cefmenoxime (cmx), cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop), ipm, cpfx and tflx showed the highest activities against e. coli with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 5. klebsiella pneumoniae k. pneumoniae was susceptible to  almost all the drugs except penicillins. carumonam (crmn) had the strongest activity with the mics for all strains equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. fmox, cpr, czop, cpfx and tflx were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. the mic90s of quinolones had changed into a better state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 6. proteus mirabilis almost all the drugs except abpc and mino showed high activities against p. mirabilis. cmx, ceftazidime (caz), latamoxef (lmox), cpr, cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx) and crmn showed the highest activities against p. mirabilis. the mics of them for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. cpfx and tflx were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 7. pseudomonas aeruginosa  the mic90 of gm was 8 micrograms/ml, the mic90s of amk, ipm and meropenem (mepm)  were 16 micrograms/ml. the others were not so active against p. aeruginosa with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. the mic90s of quinolones had changed into a lower state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 8. serratia marcescens ipm showed the highest activity against s. marcescens. its mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. gm was also active with the mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. the mic90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. the mic50s of crmn was 0.125 microgram/ml or below, the mic50s of cpr and czop were 0.25 microgram/ml.

TI  == macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris.
AB  == a cdna encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant african snail achacina fulica ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rach) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kda. carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rach was composed  of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol n-acetylglucosamine residues. antimicrobial activity  using escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus showed that the rach had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. the rach showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rach inhibited the growth of pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis in addition to e. coli and s. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus. the rach was also effective in preventing growth of vibrio anguillarum and vibrio parahaemolyticus. the results suggested that the rach had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.

TI  == identification of urer binding sites in the enterobacteriaceae plasmid-encoded and proteus mirabilis urease gene operons.
AB  == the closely related proteus mirabilis and enterobacterlaceae plasmid-encoded urease genes are positively regulated by the arac-like transcriptional activator  urer. in the presence of the effector molecule urea, urer promotes transcription  of ured, the initial gene in the urease operon, and increases transcription of the divergently transcribed urer. here, we identify urer-specific binding sites in the urerp-uredp intergenic regions. recombinant urer (rurer) was expressed and purified, and gel shift and dnase i protection assays were performed with this protein. these analyses indicated that there are two distinct rurer binding sites in both the plasmid-encoded and p. mirabilis urerp-uredp intergenic regions. a consensus binding site of ta/gt/ca/tt/gc/tta/tt/aattg was predicted from the dnase i protection assays. although rurer bound to the specific dna binding site  in both the presence and the absence of urea, the dissociation rate constant k-1  of the rurer-dna complex interaction was measurably different when urea was present. in the absence of urea, the dissociation of the protein-dna complexes, for both urerp and uredp, was complete at the earliest time point, and it was not possible to determine a rate. in the presence of urea, dissociation was measurable with a k-1 for the rurer-urerp interaction of 1.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(-2) s-1 and a k-1 for the rurer-uredp interaction of 2.6 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) s-1. this corresponds to a half-life of the urerp-rurer interaction of 58 s, and a half-life of the uredp-rurer interaction of 4 min 26 s. a model describing a potential role for urea in the activation of these promoters is proposed.

TI  == [use of pefloxacin in the treatment of patients with purulent wounds of soft tissues].
AB  == pefloxacin was used in the treatment of 25 patients with wound infection in a dose of 400 mg orally twice a day for 10-12 days. as the monotherapy it was applied to 15 patients. 7 patients with clinical signs of non-clostridial anaerobic infection were treated with pefloxacin in combination with intravenous  metronidazole. pefloxacin was highly efficient in 96 per cent of the cases with extensive posttraumatic purulent wounds with and without bone affection, acute purulent wounds of the soft tissue, purulent wounds of the soft tissues in diabetic patients, trophic or decubitus ulcer. 266 clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter spp. and acinetobacter spp, were tested and 75 to 100 per cent of them was shown to be susceptible to pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin. at the  same time the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella spp. were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin. the pathogen eradication and eradication with superinfection in the cases treated with pefloxacin amounted to 92 per cent. the  drug tolerance was good. no clinically significant adverse events were recorded.

TI  == a novel membrane protein influencing cell shape and multicellular swarming of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == swarming in proteus mirabilis is characterized by the coordinated surface migration of multicellular rafts of highly elongated, hyperflagellated swarm cells. we describe a transposon mutant, mns185, that was unable to swarm even though vegetative cells retained normal motility and the ability to differentiate into swarm cells. however, these elongated cells were irregularly curved and had  variable diameters, suggesting that the migration defect results from the inability of these deformed swarm cells to align into multicellular rafts. the transposon was inserted at codon 196 of a 228-codon gene that lacks recognizable  homologs. multiple copies of the wild-type gene, called ccma, for curved cell morphology, restored swarming to the mutant. the 25-kda ccma protein is predicted to span the inner membrane twice, with its c-terminal major domain being present  in the cytoplasm. membrane localization was confirmed both by immunoblotting and  by electron microscopy of immunogold-labelled sections. two forms of ccma were identified for wild-type p. mirabilis; they were full-length integral membrane ccma1 and n-terminally truncated peripheral membrane ccma2, both present at approximately 20-fold higher concentrations in swarm cells. differentiated mns185 mutant cells contained wild-type levels of the c-terminally truncated versions of both proteins. elongated cells of a ccma null mutant were less misshapen than those of mns185 and were able to swarm, albeit more slowly than wild-type cells.  the truncated ccma proteins may therefore interfere with normal morphogenesis, while the wild-type proteins, which are not essential for swarming, may enhance migration by maintaining the linearity of highly elongated cells. consistent with this view, overexpression of the ccma gene caused cells of both escherichia coli  and p. mirabilis to become enlarged and ellipsoidal.

TI  == the penicillins.
AB  == the penicillin family of antibiotics remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. in general, these agents have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections caused by susceptible bacteria. the initial introduction of aqueous penicillin g for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an  important pharmacologic landmark. the emergence of penicillinase-producing staphylococcus aureus prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (for example, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin), in which an acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactamase ring. subsequently, the aminopenicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin, and bacampicillin) were developed  because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. their spectrum initially included escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella, salmonella, listeria, haemophilus, and neisseria. the search for a penicillin with additional antimicrobial activity against the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa  led to the development of the carboxypenicillins (carbenicillin and ticarcillin)  and the ureidopenicillins (mezlocillin, azlocillin, and piperacillin). finally, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid, sulbactam, or tazobactam) and an aminopenicillin, ticarcillin, or piperacillin has further extended their antibacterial spectra by inhibiting certain beta-lactamases (non-group 1) of resistant bacteria. the development of an ideal penicillin that  is rapidly bactericidal, nonsensitizing, nontoxic, bioavailable, and resistant to beta-lactamases and that has a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins remains the goal.

TI  == the isoflavone genistein inhibits internalization of enteric bacteria by cultured caco-2 and ht-29 enterocytes.
AB  == the dietary isoflavone genistein is the focus of much research involving its role as a potential therapeutic agent in a variety of diseases, including cancer and heart disease. however, there is recent evidence that dietary genistein may also  have an inhibitory effect on extraintestinal invasion of enteric bacteria. to study the effects of genistein on bacterial adherence and internalization by confluent enterocytes, caco-2 and ht-29 enterocytes (cultivated for 15-18 d and 21-24 d, respectively) were pretreated for 1 h with 0, 30, 100, or 300 micromol/l genistein, followed by 1-h incubation with pure cultures of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, or escherichia coli. pretreatment of caco-2 and ht-29 enterocytes with genistein inhibited bacterial internalization in a dose-dependent manner (r = 0.60-0.79). compared to untreated enterocytes, 1-h pretreatment with 300 micromol/l genistein was generally associated with decreased bacterial internalization (p < 0. 05) without a corresponding decrease in bacterial adherence. using caco-2 cell cultures, decreased bacterial internalization was associated with increased integrity of enterocyte tight junctions [measured by increased transepithelial electrical resistance (teer)], with alterations in the distribution of enterocyte perijunctional actin filaments (visualized by fluorescein-labeled phalloidin), and with abrogation of the decreased teer associated with s. typhimurium and e. coli incubation with the enterocytes (p < 0.01). thus, genistein was associated with inhibition of enterocyte internalization of enteric bacteria by a mechanism  that might be related to the integrity of the enterocyte tight junctions, suggesting that genistein might function as a barrier-sustaining agent, inhibiting extraintestinal invasion of enteric bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of synthetic bismuth compounds against clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen responsible for pseudomembranous colitis and many cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. because of potential relapse of disease with current antimicrobial therapy protocols, there is a need for additional and/or alternative antimicrobial agents for the treatment of disease caused by c. difficile. we have synthesized a systematic series of 14 structurally simple bismuth compounds and assessed their  biological activities against c. difficile and four other gastrointestinal species, including helicobacter pylori. here, we report on the activities of six  compounds that exhibit antibacterial activities against c. difficile, and some of the compounds have mics of less than 1 microgram/ml. also tested, for comparison, were the activities of bismuth subcitrate and ranitidine bismuth citrate obtained from commercial sources. c. difficile and h. pylori were more sensitive both to the synthetic bismuth compounds and to the commercial products than were escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis, and the last three species were markedly resistant to the commercial bismuth salts. testing with human foreskin fibroblast cells revealed that some of the synthetic compounds were more cytotoxic than others. killing curves for c. difficile treated with the more active compounds revealed rapid death, and electron microscopy showed that the bismuth of these compounds was rapidly incorporated by c. difficile. energy dispersive spectroscopy x-ray microanalysis of c. difficile  cells containing electron-dense material confirmed the presence of internalized bismuth. internalized bismuth was not observed in c. difficile treated with synthetic bismuth compounds that lacked antimicrobial activity, which suggests that the uptake of the metal is required for killing activity. the nature of the  carrier would seem to determine whether bismuth is transported into susceptible bacteria like c. difficile.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  == background: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. methods: cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. in application mode i, patients received on the day  before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. in application mode ii, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees c. the hplc method was used for measuring the concentration. results: the highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. in this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). these mean concentration are all above the mic90 of gram-negative bacteria like proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. in some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. conclusions: the mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the mic90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == the antibacterial effects of tumescent liposuction fluid.
AB  == tumescent liposuction is currently one of the most commonly performed aesthetic procedures. despite the variable use of preoperative antibiotics, infection is uncommon. prior works suggest that the low incidence of infection may be due to lidocaine's antibacterial properties. however, these properties have only been demonstrated using concentrations of lidocaine above 0.8%, significantly higher than those used in tumescent liposuction. the purpose of this study was to determine if the commonly used tumescent fluid containing 0.1% lidocaine, 1:1000,000 epinephrine, and 0.012 meq sodium bicarbonate possesses antibacterial  activity. using the broth microdilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus were determined after exposure to either lidocaine, epinephrine, bicarbonate, or the combination  of all three agents. to determine if there were significant growth differences not detectable by the broth microdilution method, bacterial concentrations were obtained through the use of a spectrophotometer, and significant differences from the controls were calculated by one-way analysis of variance. to determine if prolonged exposure to the tumescent mix would alter bacterial growth, a killing time study was also undertaken. the results indicated that the minimum inhibitory concentration of lidocaine was not less than 0.5% for any of the bacteria, whereas the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration of the combined solution was  0.25%. the lowest inhibitory concentration as determined by spectrophotometric analysis for the combined solution was 0.13% (p < 0.01). analysis of the killing  time data revealed no inhibition of bacterial growth over time. in conclusion, lidocaine, epinephrine, and bicarbonate do exhibit antibacterial properties at high concentrations. however, the commonly used tumescent mixture containing dilute concentrations of these agents does not significantly inhibit the growth of commonly encountered bacteria.

AB  == background: escherichia coli, listeria, and streptococcal antigens have been found in crohn's disease tissues. antibodies to klebsiella pneumoniae have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and ankylosing spondylitis. the presence of these bacterial antigens in crohn's granulomas would be of aetiological interest, while their presence in ulcers alone would be more likely  to indicate secondary infection. aim: to investigate inflammatory bowel disease tissues for the presence of these bacteria. methods: formalin fixed, paraffin processed sections from 53 patients (19 ulcerative colitis, 23 crohn's disease; 11 normal tissues from cancer resections) were studied by immunohistochemistry. control tissue consisted of normal human small bowel injected submucosally with either e coli, listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, or klebsiella pneumoniae serotypes k2, 3, 17, 21, 26, 36, and 50, and colonic biopsies from a child with e coli 0114 infection. tissues were stained by gram-twort, and with specific antibodies for e coli (dako b357), l monocytogenes (difco 2302-50), and  k pneumoniae (biogenesis 5580-5208) using an immunoperoxidase technique. results: positive staining for e coli was observed on the luminal surface epithelium and in ulcers in 35% of crohn's disease patients, 26% of ulcerative colitis patients, and no normal controls. superficial staining for l monocytogenes was observed in  one case of ulcerative colitis only. staining for k pneumoniae was observed in one case of ulcerative colitis and one of crohn's disease. no granulomas, giant cells, or germinal centres stained positively for any of the three bacterial antigens. conclusions: these data do not support a primary role for e coli, l monocytogenes, and k pneumoniae in inflammatory bowel disease. the presence of e  coli antigens in ulcers suggests secondary infection in these lesions.

TI  == characterization and nucleotide sequence of carb-6, a new carbenicillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase from vibrio cholerae.
AB  == a clinical strain of vibrio cholerae non-o1 non-o139 isolated in france produced  a new beta-lactamase with a pi of 5.35. the purified enzyme, with a molecular mass of 33,000 da, was characterized. its kinetic constants show it to be a carbenicillin-hydrolyzing enzyme comparable to the five previously reported carb  beta-lactamases and to sar-1, another carbenicillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase that has a pi of 4.9 and that is produced by a v. cholerae strain from tanzania.  this beta-lactamase is designated carb-6, and the gene for carb-6 could not be transferred to escherichia coli k-12 by conjugation. the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene was determined by direct sequencing of pcr-generated fragments from plasmid dna with four pairs of primers covering the whole sequence of the reference carb-3 gene. the gene encodes a 288-amino-acid protein that shares 94% homology with the carb-1, carb-2, and carb-3 enzymes, 93% homology with the proteus mirabilis n29 enzyme, and 86.5% homology with the carb-4 enzyme. the sequence of carb-6 differs from those of carb-3, carb-2, carb-1, n29, and carb-4 at 15, 16, 17, 19, and 37 amino acid positions, respectively. all these mutations are located in the c-terminal region of the sequence and at the surface of the molecule, according to the crystal structure of the staphylococcus aureus  pc-1 beta-lactamase.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  == in adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria enterococcus, staphylococcus, streptococcus agalactiae. in rare cases the cause of infection may also be pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae. aim of the study: the aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of  urinary infections. method of the study: we isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the university children's hospital in belgrade. urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking  the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by uricult test. the samples  were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. identification was done by standard  bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious api-20e (biomerieux) was used. bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on muller-hinton agars. results: based on the obtained results, escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to  co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). discussion: it may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. however, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by escherichia coli. natural resistance to ampicillin of klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. contrary to proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus and providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics,  ampicillin was widely used. the wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. a fall in the sensitivity of klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole,  which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant klebsiella species. the sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas  aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). the most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes

TI  == procaryotic expression of single-chain variable-fragment (scfv) antibodies: secretion in l-form cells of proteus mirabilis leads to active product and overcomes the limitations of periplasmic expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == recently it has been demonstrated that l-form cells of proteus mirabilis (l vi),  which lack a periplasmic compartment, can be efficiently used in the production and secretion of heterologous proteins. in search of novel expression systems for recombinant antibodies, we compared levels of single-chain variable-fragment (scfv) production in escherichia coli jm109 and p. mirabilis l vi, which express  four distinct scfvs of potential clinical interest that show differences in levels of expression and in their tendencies to form aggregates upon periplasmic  expression. production of all analyzed scfvs in e. coli was limited by the severe toxic effect of the heterologous product as indicated by inhibition of culture growth and the formation of insoluble aggregates in the periplasmic space, limiting the yield of active product. in contrast, the l-form cells exhibited nearly unlimited growth under the tested production conditions for all scfvs examined. moreover, expression experiments with p. mirabilis l vi led to scfv concentrations in the range of 40 to 200 mg per liter of culture medium (corresponding to volume yields 33- to 160-fold higher than those with e. coli jm109), depending on the expressed antibody. in a translocation inhibition experiment the secretion of the scfv constructs was shown to be an active transport coupled to the signal cleavage. we suppose that this direct release of  the newly synthesized product into a large volume of the growth medium favors folding into the native active structure. the limited aggregation of scfv observed in the p. mirabilis l vi supernatant (occurring in a first-order-kinetics manner) was found to be due to intrinsic features of the scfv and not related to the expression process of the host cells. the p. mirabilis l vi supernatant was found to be advantageous for scfv purification. a  two-step chromatography procedure led to homogeneous scfv with high antigen binding activity as revealed from binding experiments with eukaryotic cells.

TI  == use of cell wall-less bacteria (l-forms) for efficient expression and secretion of heterologous gene products.
AB  == in spite of many efforts and achievements to optimize the prokaryotic expression  systems, there are still general and specific problems in obtaining sufficient yields of the functionally active gene products. the main problems concern the formation of inclusion bodies, incorrect folding, toxicity for the producer cells and degradation by proteases. one way to overcome these problems is with expression systems alternative to those of escherichia coli. for the first time,  cell wall-less l-form bacteria were used to establish such an alternative expression system and test its practicability. the results showed that various recombinant proteins can be synthesized in considerable amounts as soluble, functionally active products with these cell wall-less strains.

AB  == the action of piperacillin-tazobactam on 4,137 of the 4,364 strains collected in  a spanish multicenter study involving 46 participating hospitals was studied. the samples were from the following: 41% urine, 18% exuded from wound abscesses, 13%  respiratory, 9% blood, 3% peritoneal liquid, and the remainder from other various sources. the gram-negative bacteria included 2,778 strains from 13 genera: escherichia (1,289), pseudomonas (451), proteus (230), klebsiella (203), haemophilus (172), enterobacter (145), acinetobacter (88), salmonella (60), bacteroides (57), morganella (53), serratia (46), citrobacter (46), stenotrophonomas (23) and moraxella (21). the gram-positive bacteria were s. aureus (316), e. faecalis (239), s. epidermis (130), s. pneumoniae (115) and clostridium spp. (12). the global susceptibility of the gram-negatives to piperacillin-tazobactam was 94%: e. coli 98%, p. aeruginosa 92%, and p. mirabilis, morganella, k. pneumoniae, serratia and salmonella spp. all greater than 94%. the susceptibility of other bacteria was as follows: 91% citrobacter, 77% e. cloacae, 42% a. baumannii, 61% s. maltophilia, 97% e. faecalis, 93% s. epidermidis, 100% m. catarrhalis, 99% h. influenzae and 100% anaerobic bacteria.  the action on s. pneumoniae and s. aureus varied according to the susceptibility  or lack there of to penicillin or methicillin. in comparison to other antibiotics (piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin), piperacillin-tazobactam was far better than piperacillin alone and better or similar to the others.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

AB  == seventy-seven patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm), 57 males and 20 females, aged 17-86 years, were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital, over an 11-year period. fifty-four infections were community-acquired, and 23 were nosocomial; 49 were spontaneous and 28 occurred after head surgery or neurosurgery. the organisms most frequently involved were klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter. rarer pathogens included citrobacter species, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. all patients who did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy died. the mortality in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 28%. other statistically significant prognostic factors included septic shock, initial level of consciousness, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic coma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, high cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels and leucocytosis. in the multiple logistic regression analysis, only appropriate antimicrobial therapy and septic shock were strongly associated with mortality even after adjusting for other potentially confounding factors. despite the high mortality, management can be improved by early diagnosis, early use of appropriate antibiotics, and correction of underlying and associated medical derangement.

TI  == a quantitative study of genital skin flora and urinary colonization in spinal cord injured patients.
AB  == this study was performed to define the relation between colonization of genital skin flora and bacteriuria in spinal cord injured patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. twenty-seven female and 23 male spinal cord injured patients were included in the study. patients were evaluated regarding their type of bladder management, educational status, level and degree of the spinal cord lesion. quantitative cultures were obtained from the perineum labium/dorsum of penis, external meatus of urethra, and urine. we investigated whether the organisms isolated from urine were also present in one or more skin sites in every patient. in total 54 identical bacterial isolates were observed both from urine and one or more skin sites in 43 of the patients. escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus stuartii were the most common bacterial isolates. the distribution of identical colonization of genital skin flora with urine were as follows: 30 in urethra, one in perineum, four in urethra and perineum, nine in urethra and labium/dorsum of penis, and 10 in both three skin sites. identical colonization of both perineum and labium/dorsum of penis with urine were significantly higher in female patients than those of males (p =  0.037, p = 0.003, respectively). no significant difference was found in the presence/distribution of colonization with respect to type of bladder management, educational status, and neurologic status. these results demonstrate the importance of the urethra, perineum, and labium/dorsum of penis as a source of bacteria causing urinary infection in spinal cord injured patients.

TI  == antibodies to urinary tract pathogens in patients with spinal cord lesions.
AB  == chronic or recurrent urinary tract infection (uti) is a significant problem or patients with spinal cord lesions (scl). utis are thought to be a major factor in the development of reduced renal function. to investigate the pathogenesis 151 patients with scl were included in this study during a 7 year period. results of  intravenous pyelography and isotope renography were recorded as well as the bladder emptying methods. one to seven blood samples were obtained from each patient and tested for plasma creatinine, and the presence of precipitating antibodies against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, klebsiella ozaenae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we found significant correlation between duration of scl and precipitating antibodies against urinary tract pathogens (pau) (r = 0.23, p < 0.005), between plasma creatinine and pau in patients with spina bifida (r = 0.64, p < 0.01), between pau and the number of positive urine cultures (r = 0.17; p < 0.05) and a relation between abnormal urological findings and pau. in addition, the pau was significantly higher in patients with indwelling urethral catheters (p < 0.001).  thus it seems that pau can be of prognostic value in scl patients, and pau might  be an indicator for intensified treatment of recurrent uti.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  == of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by escherichia coli (e coli), followed by proteus mirabilis (p mirabilis), klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. of e coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-r), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (amc). for p mirabilis, ampi-r isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to amc. klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to amc. in these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. in the other enterobacteria (enterobacter  cloacae, morganella morganii, p vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and amc) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of p vulgaris to amc. enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and p aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. for staphylococcus aureus,  the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. all the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.

AB  == beta-lactam resistance on the part of the enterobacteriaceae causes serious therapeutic problems in our institutions due to their production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbetals). we studied the in vitro activity of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and third-generation cephalosporins and monobactams against 71 clinically relevant enterobacteriaceae  which produced tem- and shv-derivative esbetals. of the single drugs and combinations tested, piperacillin/tazobactam proved to be the most effective. piperacillin/tazobactam was highly active against proteus mirabilis, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranging from 0.125 to 16 microg/ml; escherichia  coli (mics from 2 to 16 microg/ml) and serratia marcescens (mics from 4 to 8 microg/ml), while its activity against klebsiella pneumoniae esbetal producers turned out to be closely related to the type and the amount of enzyme produced, the mic ranging from 1 to 128 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of piperacillin/tazobactam was stronger than that of ticarcillin/clavulanate, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam, and the combination shared favorable in vitro activity properties against the esbetal producers with imipenem which, however, should be kept as reserve product.

TI  == activities of ll-37, a cathelin-associated antimicrobial peptide of human neutrophils.
AB  == human neutrophils contain two structurally distinct types of antimicrobial peptides, beta-sheet defensins (hnp-1 to hnp-4) and the alpha-helical peptide ll-37. we used radial diffusion assays and an improved national committee for clinical laboratory standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of ll-37, hnp-1, and protegrin (pg-1). although generally less potent than pg-1, ll-37 showed considerable activity (mic, <10 microgram/ml) against pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mm nacl. certain organisms (methicillin-resistant s. aureus, proteus mirabilis, and candida albicans) were resistant to ll-37 in media that contained 100 mm nacl but were susceptible in low-salt media. burkholderia cepacia was resistant to ll-37,  pg-1, and hnp-1 in low- or high-salt media. ll-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of e. coli ml-35p. chromogenic limulus assays revealed that ll-37 bound to e. coli o111:b4 lipopolysaccharide (lps) with a high affinity and  that this binding showed positive cooperativity (hill coefficient = 2.02). circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that ll-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid a, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. the broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of ll-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hcap-18) may protect skin and other tissues  from bacterial intrusions and lps-induced toxicity. the potent activity of ll-37  against p. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis.

TI  == transfer of resistance to oxy-imino-cephalosporins and of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase productions in klebsiella pneumoniae strains from infected neonates.
AB  == in this communication, we describe the occurrence of strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to cephalosporins of all generations and to aztreonam due to their production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), in two hospitals in slovakia. they were found to transfer the genetic determinants of resistance of cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam and of esbl production to suitable recipient strains of escherichia coli k-12 no. 3110 and proteus mirabilis p-38. six donor k. pneumoniae strains were collected from six prematurely born babies gradually infected with strains of k. pneumoniae resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. all six strains of k. pneumoniae gave an identical pattern in esbl testing (double-disk diffusion test). the second cycle of transfers to nalidixin-resistant e. coli k-12 no. 185 nal+ also confirmed that all transconjugants were resistant to all beta-lactams tested. we conclude that a single gene was transferred from donor strains which confers 'en bloc' the resistance to the beta-lactams tested. four strains of k. pneumoniae produced a uniform type of esbi. although with different quantitative expression. all transconjugants tested produced identical types of esbl as did the donor strains  of k. pneumoniae. this transfer of an identical pattern of esbl production was confirmed also in the second cycle of transfers. cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam were actively hydrolysed (as shown by the relative rate of hydrolysis [vmax]) by strains of k. pneumoniae as well as by transconjugant colonies and clavulanate inhibited the hydrolysis of these beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == novel genes that upregulate the proteus mirabilis flhdc master operon controlling flagellar biogenesis and swarming.
AB  == by screening for restoration of multicellular migration in a non-swarming but motile proteus mirabilis mutant lacking the fign facilitator of flagella assembly, we identified four distinct genes that, in trans and multicopy, increased flagella production and cell length. each of the genes upregulated expression of the flhdc master operon that controls flagellar biogenesis, cell division and swarming, not only in the mutant but also in the wild type. the genes were named umoa, umob, umoc and umod. disruption of each of the wild-type chromosomal umo genes caused corresponding reductions in swarming and cell elongation, which correlated with decreased expression of the flhdc operon. the umoa, umob, umoc and umod genes are not closely linked, and only umob is part of  an operon. the sequences of the calculated gene products, umoa (20.6 kda), umob (78.0 kda), umoc (15.2 kda) and umod (19.2 kda), contain putative n-terminal secretion signals and predict a location in the cell membranes or periplasm. umob and umod have sequence similarity to the escherichia coli uncharacterized open reading frames yrff and ycfj respectively; umoa and umoc have no known homologues. the umob and umoc gene transcripts were present at very low levels, but umoa and umod expression was similar to that of flhdc and increased in parallel with flhdc expression during differentiation into elongated hyperflagellated swarm cells. like flhdc, umoa and umod expression was subject to negative feedback in aflagellar assembly mutant lacking the flha inner membrane component of the export machinery. assays of umo gene expression and cross-complementation indicated that the umo genes do not act in sequence within  a pathway to upregulate flhdc, but revealed that umoa and umod are reciprocally upregulated by flhdc. our findings strengthen the picture of the flhdc master operon as a major assimilatory checkpoint in proteus mirabilis and other gram-negative bacteria and expand the view of a complex regulatory network coupled to flagellar biogenesis.

TI  == identification of a novel transcription regulator from proteus mirabilis, pmtr, revealed a possible role of yjai protein in balancing zinc in escherichia coli.
AB  == zinc is an essential trace element required for structural integrity and functional activity of numerous proteins, yet mechanisms by which cells regulate  zinc concentration are poorly understood. here, we identified a gene from proteus mirabilis that encodes a 135-amino acid residue protein, pmtr (p. mirabilis transcription regulator), a new member of the merr family of transcription activators. transformation of escherichia coli with pmtr-carrying vectors specifically increases cell tolerance to zinc, suggesting the role of pmtr in zinc homeostasis. in response to zinc, pmtr-containing cells robustly accumulate  a 12-kda protein, the amount of which correlates with the cells' ability to grow  at high zinc concentrations. the 12-kda protein is not induced in the presence of ni2+, co2+, cd2+, mn2+, or fe2+, indicating that the pmtr-dependent expression of the 12-kda protein is specifically regulated by zinc. the 12-kda protein was identified as the c-terminal fragment of e. coli protein yjai, and was shown to contain two zinc-binding motifs. metal-affinity chromatography and 65zn blotting  assay confirmed the ability of the 12-kda protein to bind zinc specifically (zinc > cobalt >> cadmium). we propose that yjai is an important component of the zinc-balancing mechanism in e. coli, the up-regulation of which with pmtr results in an increased tolerance to zinc.

TI  == cloning and characterisation of the proteus mirabilis xerd gene.
AB  == the xer site-specific recombination system is involved in the stable maintenance  of replicons (certain plasmids and chromosomes) in escherichia coli and other bacteria by converting multimers into monomers. this system requires a cis-acting dna sequence (the chromosomal dif site or the cole1 cer site) and two trans-acting factors: the xerc and xerd recombinases, which belong to the lambda  integrase family of tyrosine site-specific recombinases. in addition, in order to resolve plasmid multimers into monomers, two additional factors are required: the argr and pepa proteins. we have previously shown the presence of xerc and xerd genes (and their function) by southern hybridisation and by in vivo recombination in a wide variety of enterobacteriaceac. we have now cloned and sequenced the xerd gene of proteus mirabilis using degenerate and inverse pcr methods. this gene encodes a tyrosine recombinase which is highly similar to the e. coli xerd recombinase, is capable of complementing an e. coli xerd mutant, and displays sequence-specific dna binding activity.

AB  == this paper describes transferability of antibiotic resistance determinants in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem, cefotaxime and ceftazidime obtained from different clinical settings in three different countries. two strains of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli k-12 and proteus mirabilis p-38) and two strains of p. aeruginosa (pao and ml) were used as recipient strains. the conjugative transfer of resistance was very specific, i.e. donor strains of p. aeruginosa transferred individual resistance determinants either to recipient strains e. coli k-12 and p. mirabilis p-38, or to p. aeruginosa pao or ml. in a case when three different species (p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were isolated from a single patient, a block of resistance determinants was transferred both to enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa recipients. a single plasmid with rather specific properties was suspected of being exchanged among strains of these different species. it was recommended to study the overall situation of transferability of individual resistance determinants in bacterial strains belonging to various species of nosocomial bacteria, especially of p. aeruginosa, by using a rather specific methodology.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacterial adherence to biodegradable self-reinforced polyglycolic acid (sr-pga) and self-reinforced poly-dl-lactic acid (sr-pla 96) spiral stents in vitro. they are used as temporary urethral stents in urology. gold-plated metal wire, polyurethane and latex were used as controls. materials were incubated up to 28 days in artificial urine, after which a bacterial suspension was added. after detaching by sonication the adhesive bacteria were analysed as colony forming units (cfus) and by scanning electron microscopy (sem) analysis. adhesion was more significantly correlated to stent bacterial type than to the tested material in both assays. no encrustation was seen on sr-pga or sr-pla 96. sr-pga and sr-pla 96 had no effect on the bacterial  growth. in conclusion, the bacterial properties are equally or more important than the material properties in the adhesion process.

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

TI  == escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis inhibit the perinuclear but not the circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody reaction.
AB  == background: perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-anca) are found  in 48%-83% of serum samples from patients with ulcerative colitis (uc). their pathogenic role and initiating stimuli are unknown. in contrast to patients with  vasculitides and anca reactivities, the antibodies in uc patients do not react with myeloperoxidase (mpo) or proteinase 3 (pr3). the aim of the present study was to investigate whether bacterial species of the intestinal tract and other sources could interfere with p-anca in sera from patients with uc. methods: seventeen p-anca-positive and anti-mpo-negative serum samples from patients with  uc were tested with escherichia coli 014 and staphylococcus aureus wood 46. six of these serum samples with different p-anca titres were selected to test further the influence of 15 different gram-negative or gram-positive bacterial strains. six anti-mpo positive p-anca, 5 anti-pr3 positive c-anca, and 10 antinuclear antibody (ana)-positive serum samples were used as controls. the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ancas) were analysed by an indirect immunofluorescence method (iif) on ethanol-fixed neutrophils, and the anas were tested by iif on hep-2 cells or rat liver tissues. the bacteria used in the experiments were either live or killed by formalin or glutaraldehyde fixation or heated at 80 degrees c for 30 min. the test was first performed as a bacterial absorption test with sedimented organisms and then at various temperatures with the supernatant from suspension of live bacteria. results: both mpo-positive and mpo-negative p-anca reactivity was abolished by absorption of patient sera with live e. coli and proteus mirabilis but not with bacteria representing members of 10 other species, suggesting that antibody reactivity was absorbed away. however, continued experiments indicated that the inhibition of p-anca was not due to classic antigen-antibody interactions but rather to decomposition of the antigenic substrate of the neutrophils by factors present in the supernatants of  live e. coli and p. mirabilis. the activity of the supernatant was temperature-dependent, with strong activity at room temperature and 37 degrees c, no activity at 0 degrees c, and abolished by mild heat treatment (56 degrees or 60 degrees c). no activity was shown in the supernatants from bacteria treated with formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde. conclusions: soluble material from live e. coli and p. mirabilis has the capacity to decompose the antigenic substrate of neutrophils responsible for both mpo-positive and mpo-negative p-anca, most probably brought about through enzymatic activity. anti pr3-positive c-anca were  not affected, which suggests substrate specificity of the proposed enzymatic activity.

TI  == a comparison between single-dose fosfomycin trometamol (monuril) and a 5-day course of trimethoprim in the treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women.
AB  == this study is a comparison of the microbiological and clinical efficacy of single-dose fosfomycin trometamol therapy and a 5 day course of trimethoprim in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in female patients. urine  dip-slide samples were obtained from 547 female patients aged 18-65 by 22 general practitioners (gps) participating in the study from 21 centres in the uk. all patients were diagnosed as having a urinary tract infection by their gp on the basis of history and clinical examination. patients were randomised to receive either single dose fosfomycin trometamol or a 5 day course of trimethoprim in a 2:1 ratio. patients who had significant bacteriuria (> or = 10(5) c.f.u/ml) at the first visit (300) were included in the microbiological analysis. the two commonest urinary pathogens isolated were escherichia coli and staphylococcus saprophyticus. trimethoprim resistance was more frequent amongst e. coli isolates whereas fosfomycin trometamol resistance was more common amongst s. saprophyticus isolates. microbiological cure was demonstrated in 83.3% of the trimethoprim treated group and 83% of the fosfomycin trometamol treated group. persistence of  the infecting bacteria was seen in 17% of each treatment arm.

TI  == urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  == in an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. urine was collected up to  6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by  the hplc assay. the total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. the mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. the antibacterial activity in  urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (ubt), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (e. coli atcc 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (mic) and bactericidal (mbc) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (uti). for the e. coli atcc 25,922, the organism with the lowest mic, median ubts of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2  days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. for the five uropathogens (with increasing mics: k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, e. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis), the ubts decreased in general, according to mics, demonstrating the same relations of ubts for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (p. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher ubts than enoxacin. the minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (mubc), as derived from urinary concentrations, and ubts showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding mbcs as determined in mueller hinton broth. in conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as ubts, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and  longest-lasting ubts followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). a dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated uti could be worth testing.

TI  == beta-lactamases responsible for resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins in klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis isolates recovered in south africa.
AB  == although resistance to the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins among members of the  family enterobacteriaceae lacking inducible beta-lactamases occurs virtually worldwide, little is known about this problem among isolates recovered in south africa. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins recovered from patients in various parts of south africa over a 3-month period were investigated for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion and agar dilution procedures. production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was evaluated by using the double-disk test, and the beta-lactamases were characterized by spectrophotometric hydrolysis assays and an isoelectric focusing overlay technique which simultaneously determined isoelectric points and general substrate or inhibitor characteristics. dna amplification and sequencing were performed to confirm the identities of these enzymes. the p. mirabilis and e. coli isolates were found to produce tem-26-type, shv-2, and shv-5 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. an ampc-related  enzyme which had a pi of 8.0 and which conferred resistance to cefoxitin as well  as the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins was found in a strain of k. pneumoniae. this is the first study which has identified organisms producing different extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from south africa and the first report describing strains of p. mirabilis producing a tem-26-type enzyme. the variety of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases found among members of the family enterobacteriaceae isolated from major medical centers in south africa is troubling and adds to the growing list of countries where these enzymes pose a serious problem for antimicrobial therapy.

AB  == norfloxacin 400 mg twice-a-day has proven to be effective and safe in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uti). since previous pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate the feasibility of using norfloxacin 800 mg once-daily, and this scheme is assumed to improve patient compliance, a double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed to compare the efficacy and  safety of norfloxacin 800 mg once-daily (group a) versus norfloxacin 400 mg twice-daily (group b) in the treatment of adult female uti for a 7-10 day period. eighty-six adult women with clinical symptoms and urinary sediment signs suggestive of uti were enrolled. in group a, treatment was clinically assessed as effective in 95.3% and bacteriologically effective in 92.0% of the patients. in group b, clinical and bacteriological efficacy was 100% and 95.5%, respectively.  differences between groups are not statistically significant. adverse events were reported by 14.0% of patients in group a and 9.6% in group b (difference not statistically significant). there was one withdrawal due to dizziness. in this study, norfloxacin 800 mg once-a-day was as effective and safe as norfloxacin 400 mg twice-a-day in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women.

TI  == cytochalasin-induced actin disruption of polarized enterocytes can augment internalization of bacteria.
AB  == cytochalasin-induced actin disruption has often been associated with decreased bacterial internalization by cultured epithelial cells, although polarized enterocytes have not been systematically studied. in assays using confluent polarized ht-29 enterocytes, cytochalasin d appeared to increase internalization  of wild-type salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli. hela and hep-2 epithelial cells, as well as ht-29 and caco-2 enterocytes, were used to clarify this unexpected observation. resulting data showed that cytochalasin d was associated with increased internalization of s. typhimurium and p. mirabilis by both ht-29 and caco-2 enterocytes and with increased internalization of e. coli by ht-29 enterocytes; with either hela or hep-2 cells, cytochalasin was associated with no change or a decrease in internalization of these same bacterial strains. cytochalasin caused decreased internalization of listeria monocytogenes by ht-29, caco-2, hela, and hep-2 cells, indicating that cytochalasin did not consistently augment bacterial internalization by polarized  enterocytes. fluorescein-labeled phalloidin confirmed marked disruption of filamentous actin in cytochalasin-treated ht-29, caco-2, hela, and hep-2 cells. cytochalasin had no noticeable effect on epithelial viability but caused distorted apical microvilli, cell rounding, and separation of adjacent enterocytes in confluent cultures (with a corresponding decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance). scanning electron microscopy showed that  cytochalasin-induced enhanced bacterial internalization was associated with preferential bacterial adherence on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface. colchicine, used to disrupt microtubules, had no noticeable effect on bacterial internalization by ht-29 or caco-2 enterocytes. these data indicated that for ht-29 and caco-2 enterocytes, cytochalasin-induced disruption of filamentous actin might augment internalization of some bacterial species by a mechanism that appeared to involve exposure of the enterocyte lateral surface.

TI  == an in-vitro study of carbapenem-induced morphological changes and endotoxin release in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == one hundred clinical isolates, including escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and proteus mirabilis, were exposed to carbapenems (imipenem, panipenem, meropenem and biapenem) at 0.5 x mic for 3 h, then their morphology was examined and endotoxin  release determined. ceftazidime, which induces filament formation, was used as a  control. scanning electron microscopy showed that these carbapenems induced formation of spherical or ovoid cells, except for p. aeruginosa treated with meropenem and biapenem; these latter cells had a 'bulge' midway along them and we have termed them 'oval-centred'. there was a relationship between morphology and  the amount of endotoxin released following exposure to carbapenems or ceftazidime. of all the species investigated, p. aeruginosa showed the most variable morphological changes. p. aeruginosa exposed to biapenem were longer oval-centred in shape, and released significantly more endotoxin than those exposed to imipenem, panipenem (spherical) or meropenem (shorter oval-centred cells) (p=0.030, 0.017 and 0.002, respectively). in all strains except p. aeruginosa, carbapenems induced significantly less endotoxin release than ceftazidime (p < 0.05).

TI  == evaluation of use of a new chromogenic agar in detection of urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == chromagar orientation, a new chromogenic medium, was evaluated for the detection  and differentiation of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic microorganisms  in 900 urine samples from hospitalized patients. performance characteristics of the medium were evaluated in comparison to those of 5% sheep blood and macconkey  agars by direct inoculation of the urine samples on the three media. four gram-negative and two gram-positive strains as well as one yeast control strain from the american type culture collection were used to ensure quality control. chromagar orientation succeeded in detecting all the urine pathogens that were detected by the reference media, including gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci,  streptococci, and yeasts. colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation accurately differentiated escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter spp. owing to the similarity in the pigmentation produced by klebsiella, enterobacter, and citrobacter isolates, the  medium failed to distinguish among them; however, these isolates were easily recognized as coliforms because of their metallic blue coloration. staphylococci  were clearly perceptible: s. aureus and s. epidermidis grow in regular-size colonies that range from opaque white to yellowish, and s. saprophyticus produces opaque pink colonies. all streptococcus strains, including those from groups b and c, were detected. they grow as undifferentiated flat dry diffused colonies, and additional tests were required for identification. enterococci were easily discriminated by their strong turquoise pigmentation and their typical growth on  the agar's surface. yeast grow in typical creamy wet convex colonies. the accuracy of antibiotic susceptibility determinations according to standard methods was also tested by picking isolates directly from chromagar orientation.  the results showed excellent correlation with those obtained with microorganisms  picked from reference media. owing to the ease in differentiating mixed flora on  chromagar orientation, antimicrobic susceptibility tests were performed directly  from primary isolates in all cases without the need for subcultures.

TI  == translocated intestinal bacteria cause spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic rats: molecular epidemiologic evidence.
AB  == background/aims: intestinal bacterial translocation is common in cirrhotic rats with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and it is thought to play a major pathogenic role. there has so far been no evidence for clonality between bacteria isolated from intestine and ascites. this study aimed to use molecular epidemiology techniques to show that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is due to  translocated intestinal bacteria. methods: samples of ascitic fluid, portal blood, mesenteric lymph nodes and ileal contents from healthy (n=10) and ascitic  cirrhotic rats with (n=12) or without (n=15) spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were cultured. in six infected rats, dna macrorestriction fragments of 30 bacterial isolates [escherichia coli (n=13), enterococcus faecalis (n=12) and proteus mirabilis (n=5)] from ascites (n=8), mesenteric lymph nodes (n=7), portal blood (n=6), and ileal flora (n=9) were compared. results: bacterial translocation was more frequent in animals with (58%) than in those without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (20%, p=0.049) or controls (10%, p=0.026). the  same bacterial strain was simultaneously isolated in ascites and in mesenteric lymph nodes and/or ileum in 7/8 (87%) instances. the identity rate for bacteria present in both ascites and mesenteric lymph nodes was 80% (4/5). likewise, identity was demonstrated in 3/4 instances of bacteria found in both ascites and  portal blood. conclusions: these results indicate that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic rats is mainly due to intestinal bacteria translocated to mesenteric lymph nodes. portal blood could be a less frequent route.

TI  == regulatory conservation and divergence of sigma32 homologs from gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and agrobacterium tumefaciens.
AB  == the heat shock response in escherichia coli is mediated primarily by the rpoh gene, encoding sigma32, which is specifically required for transcription of heat  shock genes. a number of sigma32 homologs have recently been cloned from gram-negative bacteria that belong to the gamma or alpha subdivisions of the proteobacteria. we report here some of the regulatory features of several such homologs (rpoh) expressed in e. coli as well as in respective cognate bacteria. when expressed in an e. coli delta rpoh strain lacking its own sigma32, these homologs activated the transcription of heat shock genes (groe and dnak) from the start sites normally used in e. coli. the level of rpoh in serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa cells was very low at 30 degrees c but was elevated markedly upon a shift to 42 degrees c, as found previously with e. coli. the increased rpoh levels upon heat shock resulted from both increased synthesis and  stabilization of the normally unstable rpoh protein. in contrast, the rpoh level  in proteus mirabilis was relatively high at 30 degrees c and increased less markedly upon heat shock, mostly by increased synthesis; this sigma32 homolog was already stable at 30 degrees c, and little further stabilization occurred upon the shift to 42 degrees c. the increased synthesis of rpoh homologs in all these  gamma proteobacteria was observed even in the presence of rifampin, suggesting that the induction occurred at the level of translation. thus, the basic regulatory strategy of the heat shock response by enhancing the rpoh level is well conserved in the gamma proteobacteria, but some divergence in the actual mechanisms used occurred during evolution.

TI  == the periplasmic, group iii catalase of vibrio fischeri is required for normal symbiotic competence and is induced both by oxidative stress and by approach to stationary phase.
AB  == the catalase gene, kata, of the sepiolid squid symbiont vibrio fischeri has been  cloned and sequenced. the predicted amino acid sequence of kata has a high degree of similarity to the recently defined group iii catalases, including those found  in haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides fragilis, and proteus mirabilis. upstream  of the predicted start codon of kata is a sequence that closely matches the consensus sequence for promoters regulated in escherichia coli by the alternative sigma factor encoded by rpos. further, the level of expression of the cloned kata gene in an e. coli rpos mutant is much lower than in wild-type e. coli. catalase  activity is induced three- to fourfold both as growing v. fischeri cells approach stationary phase and upon the addition of a small amount of hydrogen peroxide during logarithmic growth. the catalase activity was localized in the periplasm of wild-type v. fischeri cells, where its role could be to detoxify hydrogen peroxide coming from the external environment. no significant catalase activity could be detected in a kata null mutant strain, demonstrating that kata is the predominately expressed catalase in v. fischeri and indicating that v. fischeri carries only a single catalase gene. the catalase mutant was defective in its ability to competitively colonize the light organs of juvenile squids in coinoculation experiments with the parent strain, suggesting that the catalase enzyme plays an important role in the symbiosis between v. fischeri and its squid host.

TI  == molecular mechanisms of polymyxin b-membrane interactions: direct correlation between surface charge density and self-promoted transport.
AB  == we have studied the interaction of the polycationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin  b (pmb) with asymmetric planar bilayer membranes via electrical measurements. the bilayers were of different compositions, including those of the lipid matrices of the outer membranes of various species of gram-negative bacteria. one leaflet, representing the bacterial inner leaflet, consisted of a phospholipid mixture (pl; phosphatidylethanolamine, -glycerol, and diphosphatidylglycerol in a molar ratio of 81:17:2). the other (outer) leaflet consisted either of lipopolysaccharide (lps) from deep rough mutants of pmb-sensitive (escherichia coli f515) or -resistant strains (proteus mirabilis r45), glycosphingolipid (gsl-1) from sphingomonas paucimobilis iam 12576, or phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol, diphytanoyl-phosphatidylcholine). in all membrane systems, the addition of pmb to the outer leaflet led to the induction of current fluctuations due to transient membrane lesions. the minimal pmb concentration required for the induction of the lesions and their size correlated with the charge of the lipid molecules. in the membrane system resembling the lipid matrix of a pmb-sensitive strain (f515 lps/pl), the diameters of the lesions were large  enough (d = 2.4 nm +/- 8%) to allow pmb molecules to permeate (self-promoted transport), but in all other systems they were too small. a comparison of these phenomena with membrane effects induced by detergents (dodecyltriphenylphosphonium bromide, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, sodiumdodecylsulfate) revealed a detergent-like mechanism of the pmb-membrane interaction.

TI  == microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis associated with omphalitis in the newborn infant.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis in newborn infants. study design: retrospective review was done of the author's 20-year experience. results: specimens obtained from 11 newborn infants with periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 38 bacterial isolates was recovered: 21 aerobic and facultative and 17 anaerobic. aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 1 specimen (9%),  anaerobes only in 2 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 8 (73%). multiple organisms were recovered from all instances and the number of isolates varied from two to six (average 3.5 isolates per specimen). the predominant isolates were peptostreptococcus sp. (7 isolates); bacteroides fragilis group (6); streptococcus group b (4); and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group d, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis (3 each). all patients underwent extensive debridement and resection, and they received supportive and antimicrobial therapy. six (55%) of the patients died. conclusions: these findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis.

TI  == chromogenic detection of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases.
AB  == a coupled chromogenic reaction (based on an agar overlay combining nadh, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate, atp, and kanamycin sulfate with thiazolyl blue-phenazine methosulfate for detection of nadh consumption) was optimized for the detection of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (aphs). when used after analytical isoelectrofocusing of bacterial extracts from aph-producing strains, this method revealed one band in each of two strains with a genetically  confirmed aph (3') i and two bands in another strain with both aph (3') i and aph (3') vi, whereas no bands were detected in susceptible control strains or in aminoglycoside-resistant microorganisms without aph genes.

TI  == reduction of carriage of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 in cattle by  inoculation with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == bacteria inhibitory to escherichia coli o157:h7 were isolated from cattle and evaluated for their potential for reducing carriage of e. coli o157:h7 in calves. eighteen of 1,200 bacterial isolates from cattle feces and intestinal tissue samples were screened and determined to inhibit the growth of e. coli o157:h7 in  vitro. seventeen of the isolates were e. coli and one was proteus mirabilis. none produced shiga toxin. genomic dna fingerprinting by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed 13 distinguishable profiles among the 18 isolates. two calves inoculated perorally with a mixture of all 18 isolates (10(10) cfu) appeared to be normal and did not develop signs of clinical disease throughout a  25- to 27-day observation period. these bacteria colonized segments of the gastrointestinal tract and were in feces at the termination of the experiment (25 and 27 days postinoculation) at levels of 50 to 200 cfu/g. fifteen cannulated calves were studied to determine the efficiency of the probiotic bacteria in reducing or eliminating the carriage of e. coli o157:h7. nine calves served as controls, with each animal receiving perorally 10(10) cfu of e. coli o157:h7. e.  coli o157:h7 was detected intermittently in the rumen samples from all control animals throughout 3 weeks postinoculation, whereas e. coli o157:h7 was shed at various levels in feces continuously throughout the experiment (mean, 28 days). e. coli o157:h7 was isolated from the rumens and colons of eight of nine and nine of nine calves, respectively, at the termination of the study. six calves each received perorally 10(10) cfu of probiotic bacteria and then 2 days later received 10(10) cfu of e. coli o157:h7. e. coli o157:h7 was detected in the rumen for only 9 days postinoculation in two animals, for 16 days in one animal, for 17 days in two animals, and for 29 days in one animal. e. coli o157:h7 was detected  in feces for only 11 days postinoculation in one animal, for 15 days in one animal, for 17 days in one animal, for 18 days in one animal, for 19 days in one  animal, and for 29 days in one animal. at the end of the experiment (mean, 30 days), e. coli o157:h7 was not recovered from the rumen of any of the six animals treated with probiotic bacteria; however, e. coli o157:h7 was recovered from the  feces of one of the animals. this animal was fasted twice postinoculation. these  studies indicate that selected probiotic bacteria administered to cattle prior to exposure to e. coli o157:h7 can reduce the level of carriage of e. coli o157:h7 in most animals.

TI  == bacteraemia in the elderly.
AB  == the aims of the study were to describe community-acquired and nosocomial bacteraemia in elderly patients and to determine the factors associated with increased mortality in these patients attending a tertiary hospital in singapore. a consecutive series of 191 patients aged more than 60 years of age admitted in 1995 was studied retrospectively. all of them had positive blood culture results  obtained from the department of pathology and the case notes were reviewed and entered into a standard clinical protocol. they were analysed for age, sex, place of origin, race, sites of infection, clinical parameters and bacteriology. the mean age of the study population was 75 years (sd = 8.9 years). bacteraemia was acquired from the community in 57.5% of patients, 33% was nosocomial in origin and 9.5% acquired it in chronic long term care facilities. the common organisms cultured in community-acquired infections were escherichia coli (26.1%), klebsiella species (25.4%), streptococcus species (11.1%), methicillin sensitive  staphylococcus aureus (7.6%) and proteus mirabilis (4.8%). the common organisms cultured in nosocomial infections were klebsiella species (19.8%), enterobacter species (14.6%), e. coli (11.8%), acinetobacter baumanii (9.2%), methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus (7.9%) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (7.9%). whilst most cases of bacteraemia were single organism cultures, 13.5% were polymicrobial. the common sources of bacteraemia were chest (27.5%), urinary tract (24.5%), skin (12.5), hepatic (8.8%), gut (4.3%), cardiovascular system (1%) and others (3.6%). in 12.5% of cases, the sources were multiple and in 5.3% of cases, the source could not be identified. twenty-one per cent of patients with bacteraemia died. the following factors were associated with increased mortality rate: older age (median age of those that died was 78.5 years compared to survivors with a median age of 73 years, p = 0.011), patient's place  of origin (patients in nursing home at higher risk of death, p = 0.04), patient's mobility status (immobile patients at higher risk, p = 0.00297), source of bacteraemia--respiratory infection at increased risk of death (p = 0.00009) but urinary tract infection had a better survival rate (p = 0.03935) and multiple sites of infection (patients with multiple sites of infection had higher risk, p  = 0.00897). methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia was associated with a mortality rate of 35.3%, followed by klebsiella species 28.6%,  pseudomonas aeruginosa 28.6%, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus 25%, proteus mirabilis 25% and e. coli 19.1%. important clinical parameters which indicated a poor clinical outcome were: high pulse rate, hypotension, increased respiratory rate, low total white cell count, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia and  increased creatinine level.

TI  == in vitro activity of fosfomycin trometamol against pathogens from urinary tract infections: a spanish multicenter study.
AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of a total of 1371 urinary tract pathogens to fosfomycin trometamol were determined. according to the nccls breakpoints, enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive microorganisms were, in general, very sensitive to this antimicrobial. more than 90.0% of the escherichia coli and citrobacter spp. and more than 70.0% of the klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus spp. strains tested were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. however, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. strains were more resistant. in general, recent clinical isolates from urinary tract infections (utis) in both community and hospital were also very sensitive (> 80.0%) to fosfomycin, its activity being higher than that of the rest of the antimicrobials commonly used for therapy of uncomplicated utis. more than 75.0% of the most frequently isolated pathogens from utis, except for p. aeruginosa (31.8%) and acinetobacter spp. (11.1%), were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. the results obtained in this study, together with the infrequency of  side effects and its pharmacokinetic properties, indicate that fosfomycin trometamol may be a useful alternative for single-dose therapy of uncomplicated utis.

TI  == transmucosal passage of bacteria across rat intestinal epithelium in the ussing chamber: effect of nutritional factors and bacterial virulence.
AB  == transmucosal passage of bacteria across the intestine, the essential and prerequisite step for bacterial translocation, cannot be effectively studied using in vivo models of translocation. we have adapted the ussing chamber into a  fresh, sterile organ culture system that can facilitate the study of bacterial-epithelial interactions. intestinal membranes were mounted in the ussing chamber and perfused with a solution rich in putative mucosal micronutrients. the transmembrane potential difference was constantly monitored as a marker of intestinal integrity. transmucosal passage of various bacteria across the normal intestinal epithelium was quantitated, and the mucosal membrane was examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. the addition of potassium cyanide to the mucosal perfusate resulted in an irreversible loss of potential difference. oxygen deprivation also led to a precipitous drop in potential difference, but it was reversible with prompt reoxygenation. in contrast, intestinal membranes perfused with a solution consisting of dulbecco's  modified eagle's medium + 20 mm glutamine maintained their potential difference for a sustained period (>180 min). both the viability and structural integrity of the ileal intestinal membrane were maintained in culture ex vivo using this perfusate. qualitative differences were observed in the mechanism of transmucosal passage of mild to moderately virulent bacteria such as escherichia coli c-25 and proteus mirabilis m-13, which pass through the intestinal epithelium without causing overt damage to the mucosa, and more virulent organisms such as salmonella typhimurium, which cause extensive mucosal damage by light and transmission electron microscopy. the ussing system should provide a useful model of intact organ culture for the study of the mechanisms of bacterial translocation and the pathogenesis of enteric infections.

TI  == expression and secretion of functional miniantibodies mcpc603scfvdhlx in cell-wall-less l-form strains of proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli: a comparison of the synthesis capacities of l-form strains with an e. coli producer strain.
AB  == the paper describes the synthesis of the phosphorylcholine-binding miniantibody mcpc603scfvdhl x in cell-wall-less l-form strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. cells of these strains were transformed with the plasmid pack02sckan,  carrying the miniantibody (miniab) coding sequence under the control of the lac promoter. l-form transformants of both species were able to synthesize the functional miniab as an extracellular soluble product. the highest quantities were obtained by p. mirabilis l-form strains after induction with 5 mm isopropyl  beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg). yields of 45-75 mg/l total antibody protein  and of 10-18 mg/l functional miniab were estimated in the growth medium of shaking cultures 40-80 h after induction with iptg. about 10% of the active miniab remained cell-bound. the yields of functional miniab could be optimized by lowering the growth temperature from 37 degrees c to 26-32 degrees c and by supplementation of the medium with 80 mm sodium fumarate. a comparison of the specific activities revealed that the p. mirabilis l-form strains have a similar  synthesis capacity (2-4 mg functional miniab/g cell dry weight) to that of the producer strain e. coli rv308. the results show that the processes of correct folding and assembling of the miniab molecules are possible without the periplasmic compartment.

TI  == changing trends in frequency and antimicrobial resistance of urinary pathogens in outpatient clinics and a hospital in southern israel, 1991-1995.
AB  == in order to monitor changes in the frequency and antimicrobial resistance of urinary pathogens over several years, urinary cultures received from outpatient clinics and from a hospital during a period of one month each in 1991 and 1995 were analyzed at a clinical microbiology laboratory. in 1991 and 1995, 1366 and 1534 significant monomicrobic cultures respectively were reviewed. the frequency  of escherichia coli dropped significantly in the outpatient clinics from 70.5% to 61.2% (p < 0.0001). the frequency of proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria also decreased, but the frequency of klebsiella spp. and enterobacter spp. increased from 2.6% to 5.8% (p < 0.0001). in the hospital, the frequency of enterobacter spp. (p < 0.04), escherichia coli and morganella morganii declined from 1991 to 1995, whereas the  frequency of pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.001), acinetobacter spp. (p < 0.05), klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis and other gram-negative rods increased considerably. the frequency of gram-positive aerobic bacteria rose markedly in outpatient specimens from 6.1% to 13.5% (p < 0.0001), while a decline from 14.4%  to 9.3% was noted in hospital specimens (p < 0.02). a significant rise in the resistance of escherichia coli to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (p < 0.0001) was detected in outpatient isolates. in the hospital, gram-negative urinary pathogens demonstrated increased resistance to ampicillin (p = 0.042), cefuroxime (p = 0.005), gentamicin (p = 0.002) and ciprofloxacin (p < 0.0001) during the study period. the changing etiology of urinary tract infections and the increasing resistance of organisms indicate that periodic monitoring and possibly also modification of empirical therapy are required.

TI  == isolation, purification, and characterization of the major autolysin from pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the major (26 kda) autolysin from pseudomonas aeruginosa was purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of preparative electrophoresis, ion-exchange, and dye-ligand chromatographies. this purification was facilitated by the development of a spot-assay that involved the spotting and subsequent incubation of autolysin samples on polyacrylamide gels containing peptidoglycan. the pl of the 26-kda autolysin was determined to be between 3.5 and 4 and disulfide bonds within the enzyme were essential for activity. the autolysin catalyzed the release of reducing sugars from the peptidoglycans of pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli indicating it to be a beta-glycosidase. it was ineffective at hydrolysing the peptidoglycan from gram-positive bacteria and the o-acetylated peptidoglycans from either proteus mirabilis or staphylococcus aureus. the n-terminal sequence of the purified autolysin was determined to be his-glu-pro-pro-gly. the 26-kda autolysin together with a 29-kda autolysin was determined to be secreted into the medium by a mechanism that involves the production and release of surface membrane vesicles during normal growth, but the enzymes were not found free and active in culture broth supernatants.

TI  == use of green fluorescent protein to assess urease gene expression by uropathogenic proteus mirabilis during experimental ascending urinary tract infection.
AB  == proteus mirabilis, a cause of complicated urinary tract infection, expresses urease when exposed to urea. while it is recognized that the positive transcriptional activator urer induces gene expression, the levels of expression  of the enzyme during experimental infection are not known. to investigate in vivo expression of p. mirabilis urease, the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (gfp) was used to construct reporter fusions. translational fusions of urease accessory gene ured, which is preceded by a urea-inducible promoter, were made with gfp (modified to express s65t/v68l/s72a [b. p. cormack et al. gene 173:33-38, 1996]). constructs were confirmed by sequencing of the fusion junctions. ured-gfp fusion protein was induced by urea in both escherichia coli dh5alpha and p. mirabilis hi4320. by using western blotting with antiserum raised against gfp, expression level was shown to correlate with urea concentration (tested from 0 to 500 mm), with highest induction at 200 to 500 mm urea. fluorescent e. coli and p. mirabilis bacteria were observed by fluorescence microscopy following urea induction, and the fluorescence intensity of gfp in cell lysates was measured by spectrophotofluorimetry. p. mirabilis hi4320 carrying the ured-gfp fusion plasmid was transurethrally inoculated into the bladders of cba mice. one week postchallenge, fluorescent bacteria were detected  in thin sections of both bladder and kidney samples; the fluorescence intensity of bacteria in bladder tissue was higher than that in the kidney. kidneys were primarily infected with single-cell-form fluorescent bacteria, while aggregated bacterial clusters were observed in the bladder. elongated swarmer cells were only rarely observed. these observations demonstrate that urease is expressed in  vivo and that using gfp as a reporter protein is a viable approach to investigate in vivo expression of p. mirabilis virulence genes in experimental urinary tract  infection.

TI  == production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies to heat-shock protein 60 of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == two monoclonal antibodies (mabs), designated as h9 (igg2a) and h20 (igm), directed against heat-shock protein 60 (hsp60) of helicobacter pylori strain tk1029 were established. affinity-purified antigens cross-reacted in immunoblots  with mab h9 and mab h20 respectively. these antigens also reacted with the 3c8 mab previously established in this laboratory, which recognised yersinia enterocolitica hsp60. by amino-acid sequence analysis, the n-terminal amino-acid  sequence of the protein recognised by both h9 and h20 mabs was confirmed as the amino-acid sequence of h. pylori hsp60 reported previously. both mabs reacted with nine strains of h. pylori in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and immunoblot analysis. in addition, mab h9 reacted with extracts of other bacteria  including h. mustelae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and shigella sonnei. in contrast, mab h20 reacted only with strains h. pylori. these results suggest that both the  species-specific epitope recognised by mab h20 and the common epitope recognised  by mab h9 exist on hsp60 of the bacterial cell. both mabs also reacted with the 60-kda protein in the lysate of human gastric carcinoma (mkn45) cells. it was shown by immunohistochemical staining that gastric epithelial cells of four out of six biopsy specimens examined stained positively with mab h20. these results suggest that there is a common epitope in h. pylori hsp60 and human gastric epithelial cells.

TI  == an infection inhibiting urinary catheter material.
AB  == catheter associated bacteriuria is a common infection in hospitals and nursing homes. an infection inhibiting catheter material for fabricating urinary catheters is being developed. the material consists of silicone rubber elastomer  compounded with chlorhexidene gluconate (chg) matrix. the antibiotic is released  in sustained fashion over at least 4 weeks. a method was established for adding chg to silicone rubber. to protect the chg, it is suspended in a water soluble wax that also modulates chg release from the elastomer. it was found that chg is  randomly dispersed in the elastomer and that the primary release mechanism is by  diffusion. the antibacterial activity of the material with a range of 0.1 to 5% chg by weight was examined using in vitro zone inhibition testing. the new material demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against three pathogens tested (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus epidermidis.). the release rate of chg was measured in vitro using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). with 5% chg loading, the antibiotic was released at a steady rate of approximately 8.4 mg/cm2/day for periods extending beyond 4 weeks. this new material for urinary catheters has the potential to provide protection against infection and surface colonization.

TI  == negative feedback from a proteus class ii flagellum export defect to the flhdc master operon controlling cell division and flagellum assembly.
AB  == the proteus mirabilis flagellum class i flhdc operon was isolated, and its transcript was shown to originate from a sigma70 promoter 244 bp 5' of flhd and 29 bp 3' of a putative cyclic amp receptor protein-binding site. expression of this regulatory master operon increased strongly as cells differentiated into elongated hyperflagellated swarm filaments, and cell populations artificially overexpressing flhdc migrated sooner and faster. a class ii flha transposon mutant was reduced in flagellum class iii gene expression, as would be expected from the flgm anti-sigma28 accumulation demonstrated in salmonella typhimurium, but was unexpectedly also reduced in cell elongation. here, we show that levels of flhdc transcript were ca. 10-fold lower in this flagellum export mutant, indicating that in cells defective in flagellum assembly, there is additional negative feedback via flhdc. in support of this view, artificial overexpression of flhdc in the flha mutant restored elongation but not class iii flagellum gene  transcription.

TI  == an edwardsiella tarda strain containing a mutation in a gene with homology to shlb and hpmb is defective for entry into epithelial cells in culture.
AB  == edwardsiella tarda is an enteric pathogen that causes diarrhea, wound infections, and death due to septicemia. this species is capable of invading human epithelial cell lines, and we have now been able to follow the entry and replication of e. tarda within tissue culture host cells. e. tarda escapes from the endocytic vacuole within minutes of entry and then replicates within the cytoplasm. unlike  other well-studied bacteria that replicate and reside in the cytoplasm, we never  observed this organism moving directly from cell to cell; instead the bacteria spread by lysing the plasma membrane after several rounds of replication. efforts to study the interactions of e. tarda with tissue culture cells are complicated by the presence of a potent cytotoxin that the bacterium produces. using transposon mutagenesis, we isolated a noncytotoxic strain of e. tarda. this mutant is also defective for hemolysin production. the dual phenotype of this strain is consistent with the hypothesis that cytotoxicity is due to the previously characterized e. tarda hemolysin activity. the nonhemolytic strain is  also unable to enter hep-2 cells. the disrupted gene has sequence similarity to members of a family of genes required for transport and activation of the hemolysin genes, shla and hpma. a cosmid bearing 40 kb of e. tarda dna, including wild-type copies of the e. tarda homologs of the transporter-activator protein and the hemolysin itself, confers hemolytic, cytotoxic, and invasive abilities upon normally nonhemolytic, noncytotoxic, and noninvasive strains of escherichia  coli. sequence data indicate that the genes required for hemolytic activity are linked to a transposable element, suggesting that they arose in the e. tarda genome by horizontal transfer.

TI  == mechanisms of action of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein bpi on reconstituted outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the mechanisms of interaction of the recombinant n-terminal portion of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, rbpi21, with various planar asymmetric and symmetric bilayer membranes, including the lipid matrix of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, were investigated via electrical measurements. for the lipopolysaccharide (lps) leaflet of the outer membrane, isolated deep rough mutant lps of escherichia coli strain f515 (f515 lps) and proteus mirabilis strain r45 (r45 lps) were used. the addition of rbpi21 to the lps side of asymmetric lps/phospholipid membranes, as well as to black lipid membranes made from dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (dopg), led to membrane rupture. the innermembrane potential difference resulted in a slight increase from 0 to 5  mv for symmetric dopg membranes but changed for asymmetric f515 lps/pl membranes  from -36 to +8 mv and for r45 lps/pl membranes from -37 to -5 mv following the addition of rbpi21. in all cases, the addition of rbpi21 led to an increase in membrane current. the effect of rbpi21 on the innermembrane potential difference  of lps/pl membranes was significantly reduced in the presence of 40 mm mgcl2 (shift from -36 to -31 mv for f515 lps). on the basis of these results and from our studies on the interaction of rbpi21 with lipid monolayers and aggregates [wiese, a., et al. (1997) biochemistry 36, 10301-10310], a model is discussed explaining how the observed membrane rupture, increase of membrane current, and change of transmembrane potential as induced by rbpi21 may contribute to bacterial dysfunction.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a carbenicillin-hydrolysing (carbenicillinase) gene occurring in an endogenous plasmid, pcs229, of proteus mirabilis was determined.  the amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme, comprising 271 amino acids with a molecular mass of 29,506 da, was deduced. the pcs229 carbenicillinase showed only 46.4% similarity, in the overall amino acid sequence, to the chromosomal carbenicillinase of pr. mirabilis gn79; however, the enzyme showed about 98% similarity to a pseudomonas-specific plasmid-encoded carbenicillinase, pse-4, that was isolated from pseudomonas aeruginosa. only five of 271 amino acids differed from those of pse-4. this study proved the close relationship between the carbenicillinase genes distributed in pr. mirabilis and ps. aeruginosa.

TI  == a nonswarming mutant of proteus mirabilis lacks the lrp global transcriptional regulator.
AB  == proteus swarming is the rapid cyclical population migration across surfaces by elongated cells that hyperexpress flagellar and virulence genes. the mini-tn5 transposon mutant mns2 was isolated as a tight nonswarming mutant that did not elongate or upregulate flagellar and hemolysin genes. individual cell motility was retained but was reduced. the transposon had inserted in the gene encoding the global transcriptional regulator lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein), expression of which was upregulated in differentiating swarm cells. swarming was  restored to the lrp mutant by artificial overexpression of the flhdc flagellar regulatory master operon. lrp may be a key component in generating or relaying signals that are required for flagellation and swarming, possibly acting through  the flhdc operon.

TI  == the escherichia coli k-12 shea gene encodes a 34-kda secreted haemolysin.
AB  == haemolytic toxins belong to one of several classes of virulence factors that contribute to bacterial pathogenicity. the non-pathogenic escherichia coli k-12 laboratory strain was considered for years to be non-haemolytic. however, overproduction of several transcriptional regulators induced the appearance of a  haemolytic activity that is absent under usual laboratory growth conditions. in this work, we have cloned and characterized an e. coli k-12 gene, shea, whose overexpression results in a haemolytic phenotype. it maps to min 27 on the genetic map, and codes for a 34-kda polypeptide with at least one putative transmembrane segment. this polypeptide, which has neither signal peptide nor other known secretory motifs, is secreted to the medium during the exponential growth phase. in vitro coupled transcription/translation assays, using a plasmid  carrying only the shea gene as template, resulted in the production of a polypeptide with haemolytic activity per se. our results demonstrate that the shea gene actually encodes the e. coli k-12 chromosomal haemolysin. the shea haemolysin does not resemble other known cytolytic toxins, and it may represent the prototype of a novel family, as suggested by the presence of homologues in several e. coli pathogenic strains and in shigella flexneri.

TI  == enhanced jejunal production of antibodies to klebsiella and other enterobacteria  in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == objective: to measure gut immunity directly in jejunal fluid in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as) and rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: antibodies against three different enterobacterias were measured in jejunal perfusion fluids (collected by a double balloon perfusion device) of 19 patients with as, 14 patients with ra, and 22 healthy controls using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. results: the as patients had significantly increased jejunal fluid concentrations of igm, igg, and iga class antibodies against klebsiella pneumoniae, and igm and iga class antibodies against escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis compared with healthy controls. when compared with the patients with ra, the as patients had higher concentrations of iga and igg class antibodies only against k pneumoniae. the ra patients had higher igm class antibody concentrations against all three studied enterobacterias, when compared with the  healthy controls, suggesting an enhanced mucosal immune response in these patients. a three month treatment with sulphasalazine did not decrease enterobacterial antibody concentrations in the 10 patients with as. conclusion: there is strong direct evidence for an abnormal mucosal humoral immune response particularly to k pneumoniae in patients with as.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  == the main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus saprophyticus and candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. the residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were  both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. these results support the ongoing  efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.

TI  == iron-regulated haemolysin gene from edwardsiella tarda.
AB  == we have cloned and sequenced the haemolysin gene locus from edwardsiella tarda (eth). this region encoded two open reading frames, designated etha and ethb. etha is the haemolysin gene consisting of 4782bp encoding a product of 165.3 kda  and ethb is an activation/secretion protein gene of 1677bp that encodes a product of 61.9 kda. there were two putative ferric uptake regulator (fur) binding sites  on the 5' upstream region of the ethb gene overlapping the promoter region and ribosome-binding site. the haemolysin produced by the cloned gene was secreted by escherichia coli. the deduced amino acid sequences of the etha and ethb genes were found to be homologous to those of the haemolysin and activation/secretion proteins of haemophilus ducreyi, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens. e. coli carrying the etha gene but not the ethb gene completely lost haemolytic activity, although the etha gene was transcribed. the protein expressed by e. coli carrying a recombinant plasmid which encoded the etha gene had haemagglutination activity. the ethb protein was necessary for activation of etha protein (haemolysin). the etha and ethb genes were very prevalent in haemolytic e. tarda strains isolated from diseased fish. transcription of the ethb gene was  regulated by iron. the etha and ethb genes were transcribed independently.

(62), escherichia coli (308), klebsiella pneumoniae (27), klebsiella sp. (9), proteus mirabilis (23), pseudomonas aeruginosa (88), pseudomonas sp. (4), serratia sp. (30) and other gram-negatives  (7). susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution. the antimicrobials agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, du 6859-alpha, ceftazidime, cefepime, fk 037, imipenem, meropenem  and biapenem. results: du 6859-alpha showed the highest anti-microbial activity among the fluoroquinolones. it was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against some species. the potency and antimicrobial spectrum were similar between the fourth-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae,  except for enterobacter sp. strains which were more susceptible to cefepime than  they were to cefetazidime or fk 037. when testing pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was slightly more active than the other cephalosporins. against enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, meropenem was more active  than imipenem or biapenem. in addition, the percentage of strains, susceptible to meropenem was higher than the percentage susceptible to the other cerbapenems against these species. conclusion: the new antimicrobial agents demonstrated in vitro activity higher than that of agents commercially available. however, more studies are necessary to further evaluate the in vivo activity and the clinical benefit of these compounds.

AB  == objectives: a role for klebsiella pneumoniae in ankylosing spondylitis (as) has been suggested because faecal carriage of klebsiella and serum klebsiella specific antibodies may be increased in this disease. this study has extended the earlier findings by comparing klebsiella specific serum iga class antibodies with inflammatory changes in the gut. methods: iga antibodies to k pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis in serum samples of 25 patients with as,  of eight control patients, and of 100 healthy blood donors were measured by enzyme immunoassay. gut inflammation of the patients was studied by ileocolonoscopy. results: increased iga antibody concentrations to k pneumoniae associated with gut inflammation in patients with axial form of as. such association was not seen in patients with peripheral form of as. conclusions: these findings may provide further evidence for the role of k pneumoniae in the pathogenesis of as. however, at least some of the patients with axial as without  gut inflammation, as well as patients with peripheral as did not have increased k pneumoniae antibody concentrations, which may be regarded as evidence against the direct role of k pneumoniae in the pathogenesis. the aetiopathogenetic mechanisms in the axial and peripheral form of as may be different.

TI  == in vivo phase variation of mr/p fimbrial gene expression in proteus mirabilis infecting the urinary tract.
AB  == proteus mirabilis, associated with complicated urinary tract infection, expresses mannose-resistant/proteus-like (mr/p) fimbriae. expression of these surface structures, which mediate haemagglutination and have a demonstrated role in virulence, undergoes phase variation. by dna sequence analysis, a 252 bp invertible element was found in the intergenic region between mrpl, the putative  site-specific recombinase gene, and mrpa, the primary structural subunit gene. the invertible segment is flanked by identical 21 bp inverted repeats and the presumptive half-sites for recombinase binding show homology to those recognized  by fimb and fime encoded by the escherichia coli fim (type 1 fimbriae) gene cluster. when amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from static broth  cultures expressing mr/p fimbriae, the switch region was found in both on and off positions. when pcr was used to amplify agar cultures which do not express the fimbriae, the switch region was off only. a canonical sigma 70 promoter inside the invertible element drives the transcription of mrpa when in the on position;  in the off position it is directed away from mrpa but does not appear to drive expression of mrpi. the mrpi gene was able to confer inversion of the mrp switch  region in trans from both on to off and off to on. to examine the position of the switch in vivo, urine, bladder, and kidneys from mice transurethrally infected with p. mirabilis were used to prepare template dna for pcr amplification. in the absence of urolithiasis (urease-mediated stone formation), the switch was found 100% in the on position, a condition never observed following in vitro culture. we conclude that mr/p phase variation is regulated at the transcriptional level by the action of mrpi on an invertible element and that there is strong selective pressure for the expression of mr/p fimbriae in vivo.

TI  == antimicrobial action of rabbit leukocyte cap18(106-137).
AB  == cap18 is a cationic antimicrobial protein originally isolated from rabbit neutrophils, of which a 32-mer sequence from its c-terminal and (cap18(106-137))  has been found to be the most active. the bactericidal action of this peptide has been characterized by conventional culture techniques and flow cytometry. cultures of escherichia coli nctc10418 were exposed to the mbc (12 microm) of the peptide for up to 60 min and stained with a fluorochrome sensitive to changes in  either membrane potential (bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol [dibac4(3)), or membrane integrity (propidium iodide [pi]) before flow cytometric analysis. addition of cap18(106-137) to e. coli in broth culture resulted in immediate collapse of membrane potential [as determined by uptake of dibac4(3)] and loss of membrane integrity (as indicated by uptake of pi), with a corresponding 6- to 8-log decrease in viable counts as determined by colony formation on solid media. in identical experiments, the presence of mg2+ (1 to 10 mm), k+ (50 to 250 mm), or edta (5 mm) or incubation in nutrient-free buffer or at 4 degrees c had no effect on peptide-induced dye uptake. in contrast, addition of ca2+ (1 to 10 mm) or the respiratory chain poison carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (cccp) (50 microm) inhibited the uptake of both dyes. these findings, however, did not relate to bacterial recovery on solid media, where (unless in the presence of k+ 150 to 250 mm) cap18(106-137) at 12 microm fulfilled the mbc criteria (99.9% killing). we conclude that cap18(106-137) exerts a rapid and profound action on e. coli cytoplasmic membranes and viability as measured by colony formation. the results suggest, however, that cap18(106-137) may exert its action at sites additional to the cell membrane and  that its activity profile is unique among cationic antimicrobial proteins.

TI  == evaluation of clonal relatedness of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing proteus mirabilis isolates by quantitative antibiogram and rapd typing.
AB  == objective: to delineate, using two different typing systems, the clonal relatedness of 40 isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbetaia)-producing proteus mirabilis obtained over a period of 7 years in six hospitals in the paris area and two in pas-de-calais. methods: random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) polymerase chain reaction typing was applied by using three random primers on the esbetaia-producing p. mirabilis isolates and on isogenic escherichia coli strains with or without plasmids encoding the representative resistance pattern transferred from p. mirabilis. quantitative antibiogram typing, which was also applied to the p. mirabilis isolates, was used to define the euclidean distance between these strains. results: after having demonstrated that p. mirabilis plasmids did not influence chromosomal dna amplification, we could classify the esbetaia-producing p. mirabilis isolates into 12 groups based on rapd fingerprints. the same isolates were classified into 19 groups by quantitative antibiogram typing. despite this difference in group numbers, general concordance between the typing systems was observed. this allowed us to show that the greater number of isolates in some hospitals belonged to a single strain and that single isolates obtained in different hospitals generally represented unique strains. conclusions: a small number of esbetaia-producing p. mirabilis strains was isolated during 7 years in the eight  medical centers studied, and the number of different strains identified suggested that inter-hospital transfer had not occurred.

TI  == a national collaborative study of the in vitro activity of oral cephalosporins and loracarbef (ly 163892). australian group for the study of antimicrobial resistance (agar).
AB  == a national collaborative study involving the laboratories of 17 australian hospitals examined the in vitro activity of loracarbef, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxycillin and amoxycillin/clavulanate against 2661 recently isolated common bacterial pathogens. loracarbef was the most active agent against escherichia coli (mic90 = 1 mg/l) and had activity comparable to other agents against klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. like the oral cephalosporins, it had no activity against species of enterobacter and serratia. beta-lactamase-producing staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae were moderately sensitive to loracarbef (mic90 = 8 mg/l for both species). streptococcus pneumoniae was moderately sensitive to loracarbef (mic90 = 2 mg/l)  but strains which were insensitive to penicillin were often highly resistant.

TI  == the effect of the bacterial product, succinic acid, on neutrophil bactericidal activity.
AB  == we investigated the effect of succinic acid on neutrophil bactericidal activity in a model of intra-abdominal abscess induced in mice by the peritoneal inoculation of 5 x 10(6) cfu ml-1 e. coli and 5 x 10(8) cfu ml-1 b. fragilis plus 1 mg of bran as faecal fibre analogue. the mean ph of the induced abscesses at week 1 was 6.7, higher than the ph associated with succinic acid inhibitory activity. we therefore determined the effect of succinic acid (0-100 mm) at ph 6.7 on the bactericidal activity of mouse bone marrow-derived neutrophils. phagocytic killing of proteus mirabilis by neutrophils was significantly inhibited by 30-100 mm succinic acid at ph 6.7 but there was no significant effect of succinic acid on engulfment of bacteria at this ph. however, significant inhibition of intracellular killing (assayed by adding succinic acid  to suspensions of neutrophils which had engulfed bacteria in low serum concentrations but in the absence of succinic acid) was noted at 70 and 100 mm. these results indicate that succinic acid inhibits neutrophil bactericidal activity at a physiological ph, principally through inhibition of intracellular killing mechanisms and therefore contributing to bacterial persistence in this model of abscess formation.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humours  of patients by different topical application modes.
AB  == objective: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humour. methods: two hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract extraction received 0.3% ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin or ofloxacin eye drops by two different  administration modes with different frequencies and intervals of application. at  the beginning of cataract extraction (0.5-3 h after the last drop), 50-100 microliters aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber and immediately stored at -80 degrees c. antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: generally, topical ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin yielded aqueous humour levels higher than topical norfloxacin. the  highest concentrations of all tested fluoroquinolones were measured after using an application mode, in which one drop was given every 15 min between 0600 hours  and 0800 hours, prior to operation. when applied by this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.380 (+/- 0.328) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.033-1.388 micrograms.ml-1), norfloxacin 0.182 (0.118) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.038-0.480 microgram.ml-1) and ofloxacin 0.564 (0.372) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.064-1.455 micrograms.ml-1). these mean concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90), concentrations required for inhibition of 90% of pathogen strains in vitro of gram-negative bacteria, such as proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus epidermidis, the pathogen causing eye infections most frequently, were reached by 67.5% of patients after ofloxacin and by 41% after ciprofloxacin, but never after norfloxacin treatment. conclusion: of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humour concentration. this fluoroquinolone may be an useful ophthalmic agent for topical antibacterial  management, but it does not seem to be prophylactically effective against streptococcus pneumoniae or pseudomanas aeruginosa.

TI  == [development of resistance to difuracil (pap-49) in bacteria and its activity in  combination with other antibacterial drugs].
AB  == possible increasing of resistance to difuracil or n-(5-nitrofurfuryliden)-5-nitrofuran-2-(n'-acetyl) carboxamidohydrazon (pap-49) in staphylococcus sp., streptococcus sp. and escherichia coli was studied and the level of the resistance increasing was determined by the method of 30-fold passage of the cultures in subbacteriostatic concentrations of the drug. it was shown in vitro that the increase of the resistance to the new nitrofuran was insignificant. the most intensive adaptation was observed during the first 10 passages. during the following 10-15 passages the susceptibility level remained unchanged (e.coli) or was even somewhat higher (s. aureus and streptococcus sp.). after that a new increase of the resistance was observed. the most marked changes in the susceptibility were detected in streptococcus sp. and the least marked in  staphylococcus sp. and e.coli. combinations of difuracil in subbacteriostatic concentrations with various antibacterial drugs provided both additive and synergistic effects with respect to s.epidermidis, s. pneumonase, e.coli and p.mirabilis. the most active combinations were those of difuracil with aminoglycoside antibiotics, penicillins or chloramphenicol.

TI  == the simultaneous production of both hly- and hpm-like hemolysins is characteristic of the proteus penneri species.
AB  == clinical isolates of proteus penneri were tested for the presence of genes encoding hemolytic activity. strains possessing dna sequences similar to the hlycabd genes in escherichia coli were found. each secreted a 110 kda protein which reacted with a specific anti-hlya antiserum. southern blotting analysis revealed that the hindiii restriction fragment pattern for the hlycabd genes of these strains was conserved. similarly, the chromosomal location of these genes is relatively conserved based on the pattern of noti digested dna fragments separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. one strain carried an additional copy of the hlycabd determinant which was mapped on a second noti genomic fragment. all strains contained also chromosomally encoded sequences related to the hpmba genes originally cloned from proteus mirabilis. all strains produced a  166 kda exoprotein detected in immunoblots with a specific antiserum raised against hpma hemolysin. the hpmba genes were located on other noti fragments than hlycabd genes. in contrast to the other proteae, the simultaneous production of both hemolysins seems to be a common characteristics of proteus penneri isolates.

TI  == focal xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: partial nephrectomy as definitive treatment.
AB  == objectives: we report 11 cases of focal xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (fxgp), a disease that is very uncommon. the aim of the present work is to assess the effectivity of conservative treatment. material and methods: eleven of the 82 cases of xgp (12.5%) diagnosed between 1970 and 1995 presented the focal form (fxgf). clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological imaging studies, surgical treatment and follow-up were evaluated. results: fxgp occurred in middle-aged women (female/male ratio 4.5:1) who had a history of calculosis, urinary infections produced by escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, or urinary tract abnormalities. fxgp was unilateral in all cases. the most frequent symptom  was flank pain. some hematological and biochemical parameters were altered. intravenous urography and sonography revealed calculosis, hydronephrosis or renal mass, but these findings are nonspecific. only abdominal ct scan can establish the correct diagnosis. five of these patients (45.5%) underwent partial nephrectomy at our hospital. during the follow-up, patients showed no relapse in  the ipsilateral or contralateral kidney. serum parameters were in normal range. conclusion: when fxgp is diagnosed, local excision is recommended in all cases, since relapse in the affected kidney is unusual.

TI  == antibody responses to gut bacteria in ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
AB  == specific immunoreactive anti-klebsiella antibodies are found in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as), a significant proportion of whom have occult inflammatory bowel disease. molecular mimicry between klebsiella or other bacterial antigens and hla-b27 has been suggested in the pathogenesis of as. the  specificity of increased immunoreactivity against klebsiella remains to be assessed against the abundant anaerobic bacterial flora, present either in healthy controls or in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease  (cd). total immunoglobulin (ig; igg, iga, igm) immunoreactivity was measured by elisa against klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and ten  anaerobic isolates of the predominant normal bowel flora in 35 patients with active as, 60 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (30 cd, 30 uc), 60 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and 60 healthy controls. ig immunoreactivity to k. pneumoniae was significantly elevated in as (p < 0.001), cd (p < 0.001) and uc (p < 0.001) patients compared with ra patients and healthy  controls. furthermore, ig immunoreactivity to p. mirabilis was significantly elevated only in ra patients, compared with the other inflammatory groups (p < 0.001) and controls (p < 0.001). there was no significant antibody response against e. coli or the ten obligate anaerobes in any of the test groups. the data suggested an increased immune response to klebsiella in patients with as, uc, cd  and to proteus in patients with ra. the specificity of these responses in some patients supported a possible role for enteric klebsiella in the pathogenesis of  as and proteus in ra. the role of klebsiella in inflammatory bowel disease requires further study.

TI  == antibodies to klebsiella, proteus, and hla-b27 peptides in japanese patients with ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == objective: to determine whether patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) from japan have antibodies to klebsiella  pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis and to assess whether such antibodies are activated against peptides sharing sequences with hla-b27. methods: serum samples from 152 japanese patients, 52 with as, 50 with ra, and 50 healthy controls, were tested against 3 bacteria (k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and escherichia coli) and 3 synthetic peptides (hla-b27, pullulanase-d, and scrambled pullulanase-d control peptide) by elisa under coded conditions. samples were tested for elevations in igg, iga, and igm antibody classes in patients with active as or ra, in patients  with ra with probable disease, and in patients with inactive as. disease activity was determined by an elevated serum c-reactive protein (> 10 mg/l) level and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (> 20 mm/h). results: patients with active as showed specific elevations in serum iga antibody levels against k. pneumoniae compared to patients with ra and controls (p < 0.001). no such elevation was seen in the igg and igm antibody classes. patients with inactive as showed no elevation in any class of antibody against k. pneumoniae compared to controls or patients with ra. patients with active or probably active ra showed significant elevations in igg antibody levels against p. mirabilis compared to as and controls (p < 0.001). patients with as (active or inactive), ra (active or probably active), and controls showed no elevations in any antibody class to e. coli. both active and inactive as patients had specific autoantibodies against hla-b27 peptide compared to patients with ra and controls (active as: igg, iga, igm, p < 0.001; inactive as: igg and iga, p < 0.001). patients with active as had igg and iga antibodies against pullulanase-d peptide, which contains a sequence that cross reacts with hla-b27 compared to controls (p < 0.001). conclusion: these results provide the first evidence of as and ra patients in japan having specific elevations of antibody to k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, respectively.  this suggests that k. pneumoniae in as and p. mirabilis in ra may play a role in  triggering and/or exacerbating these diseases.

TI  == a study on the nutritive value of pollen from the chinese masson pine (pinus massoniana) and its effect on fecal characteristics in rats.
AB  == a digestion experiment with growing rats was conducted to study the effect of native and broken pollen of chinese masson pine (pinus massoniana) on fecal composition and digestibilities of dry matter, crude protein and crude ash. for that issue each 10 of 30 animals were fed a semisynthetic diet containing either  no pollen or and addition of 6% native or broken pollen for 17 days at restricted amounts. in a second experiment each 6 of 12 growing rats received a semisynthetic diet containing either no or 5% broken pollen. at day 4, 11 and 18  samples of the feces were collected and analyzed for mesophilic aerobic bacteria. the pollen contained large amounts of cell wall constituents (26-30% lignin and 10-15% cellulose, 2-13% hemicellulose) with higher values found in native pollen. the contents of crude protein, crude fat, total lipids, available carbohydrates (starch and sugars), crude ash, gross energy and metabolizable energy were 13%, 2-10%, 8-10%, 17-18%, 3.1-3.5%, 21-22 kj/g and 5.7-9.0 kj/g. the addition of native pollen to the diet increased the total amount of feces by 71% as compared  to the control level. the fecal contents of dry matter and of crude protein and crude ash in fecal dry matter changed by -5, +4 and -5 percentage units. the apparent digestibilites of dry matter and crude protein decreased by 3 and 5 percentage units, respectively, while the apparent digestibility of crude ash remained unchanged. broken pollen acted in the same direction, however the effects were about 20% less pronounced as compared to native pollen. the pollen feeding reduced the fecal germ contents of proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli, while the amounts of alpha-hemolysing streptococci was increased. in total, the observed effects of an addition of native broken or pollen to the diet seemed to be based mainly on the increased intake of cell wall constituents.

TI  == the prevalence of gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in the proteeae and its role  in the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan.
AB  == the prevalence of aac(2')-ia, a gene coding for gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in providencia stuartii, among species of the proteeae was investigated to determine if it is a common resistance factor and whether the correlation observed in p. stuartii between its expression and the levels of peptidoglycan o-acetylation represents a general feature of bacteria producing this form of modified peptidoglycan. an evaluation of the mics of gentamicin for each of the species of the proteeae did not reveal any apparent relationship between resistance and the degree of o-acetylation of peptidoglycan. the entire aac(2')-ia gene was used as a probe in southern hybridization experiments against genomic dna from each species of the proteeae. a sequence with strong homology to aac(2')-ia was present only in proteus penneri while weak hybridization was also  observed to the restriction digested dna from providencia rettgeri. other bacteria that o-acetylate peptidoglycan were also screened with this probe and a  homologous dna sequence was only found in neisseria subflava. these data suggest  that aac(2')-ia may contribute to the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan in p. stuartii, but a more specific enzyme must also be produced for this function.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == an assessment of the ability of a silver-releasing device to prevent bacterial contamination of urethral catheter drainage systems.
AB  == objective: to investigate the ability of a silver-releasing device to protect the catheterized bladder from infection by blocking the ascending migration of bacteria from contaminated urine-drainage bags. materials and methods: a simple physical model of the catheterized bladder and drainage system was used with the  device located in the drainage-tube just below the sampling port. urine was supplied to the model at 1.0 ml/min and the drainage bag was contaminated with pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. over 10 days, urine from the bag, catheter sampling-port and bladder were examined for contamination. results: bacteriological analysis showed that the mean time for test organisms to reach the sampling ports of four different control bag systems  ranged from 5.7 to 7.7 days. urine from the sampling ports of the test systems incorporating the silver device remained sterile for 10 days. the device also prevented the growth of the large populations of bacteria (10(8) colony-forming units per ml) that occurred in the control bags. while scanning electron microscopy showed the formation of bacterial biofilm throughout the control drainage systems, no bacterial colonization was visible on the surfaces of the test systems. chemical analysis established that the devices consistently generated concentrations of silver in urine ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. conclusion: the incorporation of the silver-releasing device into  the drainage systems produced an antibacterial barrier which protected the catheterized bladder from intraluminal contamination for at least 10 days. these  in vitro tests suggest a useful role for the device in controlling infection in patients undergoing short-term indwelling bladder catheterization.

AB  == uropathogenic proteus mirabilis produces at least four types of fimbriae. amino acid sequences from two peptides, derived by tryptic digestion of the structural  subunit of one type of these fimbriae, the ambient-temperature fimbriae, were determined: nvvpgqpsstq and liegenqlnyna. pcr primers, based on these sequences and that of the n terminus, were used to amplify a 359-bp fragment. a cosmid clone, isolated from a p. mirabilis genomic library by hybridization with the 359-bp pcr product, was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of the atf gene cluster. a 3,903-bp region encodes three polypeptides: atfa, the structural subunit; atfb, the chaperone; and atfc, the outer membrane molecular usher. no fimbria-related genes are evident either 5' or 3' to the three contiguous genes.  atfa demonstrates significant amino acid sequence identity with type 1 major fimbrial subunits of several enteric species. the 359-bp pcr product hybridized strongly with all proteus isolates (n = 9) and 25% of 355 escherichia coli isolates but failed to hybridize with any of 26 isolates among nine other uropathogenic species. ambient-temperature fimbriae of p. mirabilis may represent a novel type of fimbriae of enteric species.

TI  == is the ability of urinary tract pathogens to accumulate glycine betaine a factor  in the virulence of pathogenic strains?
AB  == the regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for escherichia coli. the clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. the addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except p. mirabilis. however, when clinical strains of e. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. there  was no difference in growth rates of e. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis,  cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. the ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.

AB  == although the vitek and microscan walkaway are two of the most commonly used automated antimicrobial susceptibility test systems, few studies have been performed comparing discrepancies between these systems. in this study, 500 gram  negative clinical isolates were tested against ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam,  ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin to determine the number of major interpretation discrepancies between the two systems. the 500 isolates consisted of 100 isolates each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus  mirabilis and enterobacter species. each isolate was tested simultaneously in both systems using the same standardized inoculum. eighty-four major discrepancies occurred, of which 48 were reproducible. the reproducible discrepancy rate, for the 4,500 isolate/antimicrobic combinations tested, was 48  of 4500 (1.06%). the rate for individual antimicrobics varied from 17 of 500 (3.4%) for ampicillin to no discrepancies for ticarcillin or ciprofloxacin. of the 48 reproducible discrepancies, 44 (92%) were vitek resistant, microscan susceptible. fifteen (31%) of the vitek and 21 (44%) of the microscan results were confirmed by broth microdilution. disk diffusion results were in agreement with 15 (31%) of the vitek and 21 (44%) of the microscan results. twelve (25%) of the broth microdilution and 12 (25%) of the disk diffusion results were intermediate. the broth microdilution and disk diffusion results for the 48 isolates with reproducible discrepancies were in agreement more often with microscan. however, there was less very major error comparing the vitek results for these isolates to the broth microdilution and disk diffusion. overall, the result of this evaluation indicate that the number of major interpretation discrepancies between the two systems is minimal for the isolate/antimicrobic combinations tested.

TI  == molecular cloning and overexpression of a glutathione transferase gene from proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the structural gene of the proteus mirabilis glutathione transferase gstb1-1 (gstb) has been isolated from genomic dna. a nucleotide sequence determination of gstb predicted a translational product of 203 amino acid residues, perfectly matching the sequence of the previously purified protein [mignogna, allocati, aceto, piccolomini, di ilio, barra and martini (1993) eur. j. biochem. 211, 421-425]. the p. mirabilis gst sequence revealed 56% identity with the escherichia coli gst at dna level and 54% amino acid identity. similarity has been revealed also with the translation products of the recently cloned gene bphh from haemophilus influenzae (28% identity) and orf3 of burkholderia cepacia (27%  identity). putative promoter sequences with high similarity to the e. coli sigma  70 consensus promoter and to promoters of p. mirabilis cat and glna genes preceded the atg of the gstb open reading frame (orf). gstb was brought under control of the tac promoter and overexpressed in e. coli by induction with isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside and growth at 37 degrees c. the physicochemical and catalytic properties of overexpressed protein were indistinguishable from those of the enzyme purified from p. mirabilis extract. unlike the gst belonging to mu and theta classes, gstb1-1 was unable to metabolize dichloromethane. the study of the interaction of cloned gstb1-1 with a number of antibiotics indicates that this enzyme actively participates in the binding of tetracyclines and rifamycin.

TI  == urinary tract infection in patients with short-term indwelling.
AB  == seventy patients (44(62.9%) females) requiring short-term urinary bladder catheterisation at the kenyatta national hospital, nairobi formed the study population. their mean ages +/- sd was 41+/- 26 years (range 13-100 years). the common indications and objectives for catheterisation included keeping the environment dry (41.1%), relieving urinary retention (27.0%) and urinary incontinence (24.3%). urinary tract infection (uti) was documented in 48 (68.6%)  of the patients. the commonest infection organisms were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, the three accounting for 78.6% of the infections. female gender and increasing age increased the risk of catheter-associated uti. the risk of having catheter-associated uti was higher in patients with medical and surgical conditions than in those with obstetric and gynaecology conditions. patients who were on systemic antibiotics for other conditions acquired uti less often (27%) than those who were not undergoing antibiotic therapy. the organisms isolated showed marked resistance to commonly available antibiotics. we conclude that uti, due to resistant organisms, is common in patients undergoing acute urinary bladder catheterisation in our setting and recommend that urinary bladder catheterisation should be avoided whenever possible. in a situation where this is inevitable, closed drainage systems should be used for the shortest duration possible.

TI  == preputial condition and urinary tract infections.
AB  == recently, an increase in incidences of urinary tract infections in uncircumcised  male infants has been reported. however, determining what is the best management  for the prepuce of newborns and infants is still to be solved. i investigated prospectively how much foreskins are retracted with age and what correlations it  has with urinary tract infection in 122 males children below 15 years of age. under 6 months of age, the majority of the foreskins were unretractable. as they  got older, over 3 years of age, their prepuces became retractable. the incidence  of bacteriuria was 11.4% in uncircumcised but none in circumcised and hypospadias. in 8 patients showing bacteriuria, their foreskins were retracted below 25% in length. among them, 5 patients, in whom e. coli were grown in their  urine, showed radiologic renal abnormalities and suffered from high fever indicating systemic infection. however, the other 3 cases infected by proteus mirabilis in their urine complained of only local penile symptoms.

AB  == ten clinical isolates of proteus mirabilis were found to produce an inhibitor-resistant tem beta-lactamase (irt) in association with a tem-1 enzyme.  the irt enzyme was derived from tem-2. the blairt gene differs from blatem-2 gene by one point mutation which leads to the amino-acid substitution arg-->ser at position 244, as observed for the original irt-2 enzyme derived from tem-1 reported in escherichia coli. this is the first report of an irt beta-lactamase derived from tem-2.

TI  == activation of transcription at divergent urea-dependent promoters by the urease gene regulator urer.
AB  == the proteus mirabilis and plasmid-encoded urease loci contain seven contiguous structural and accessory genes (uredabcefg) and the divergently transcribed urer, which codes for an arac-like transcriptional activator. previously, it was shown  that the plasmid-encoded urer to ured intergenic region contained divergent promoters (urerp and uredp). transcription from these promoters required both the effector molecule urea and the activator protein urer. in this report, we demonstrate that the p. mirabilis urease gene cluster contains similar divergent  urea- and urer-dependent promoters. the urer gene products from either urease locus were able to activate transcription at both the plasmid-encoded and p. mirabilis promoters. the minimal concentration of urea required to activate transcription at urerp or uredp from either gene cluster was approximately 4 mm.  the transcriptional start sites for the plasmid-encoded and p. mirabilis divergent promoters were similar in an escherichia coli dh5 alpha background, as  determined by primer-extension analysis. however, in p. mirabilis hi4320, transcription of urer initiated predominately at an alternative site. physical mapping and inhibition studies were used to localize the urer-binding sites within the plasmid-encoded urerp and uredp intergenic sequences to regions of 68  bp and 86 bp, respectively. gel shift analysis demonstrated that urer bound to a  135 bp fragment in the approximate centre of the plasmid-encoded urer to ured intergenic region. the results presented here suggest that the p. mirabilis and plasmid-encoded urease gene clusters utilize similar mechanisms of transcriptional activation in response to urea.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml  was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  == it has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an n-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. in an attempt to find such a precursor, a cdna clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cdna library from porcine bone marrow. in order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we  have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the c-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. we found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of vrrfpwwwpflrr had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. it showed potency against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus group d as well  as aspergillus fumigatus. the action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than  bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mm mgcl2. our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cdna indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.

AB  == during the first six months of 1990 and 1994 respectively, 3179 and 2721 non-repetitive strains of enterobacteriaceae were isolated at the teaching hospital of clermont-ferrand. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were found in 147 isolates, mainly in klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 37) and proteus mirabilis (n = 15). tem-3/ctx-1, shv-4/caz-5 and tem-24/caz-6 were the prevalent enzymes. however, the most frequently involved enzyme in 1990  was tem-3 (48.6%) whereas in 1994 it was shv-4 (56.0%). two salient features emerged from this study: the high frequency of tem-3 production in p. mirabilis and the production of shv-4 enzyme, heretofore observed solely in k. pneumoniae,  in two other species, e. aerogenes and escherichia coli.

TI  == intracellular survival of enteric bacteria in cultured human enterocytes.
AB  == translocating enteric bacteria have been visualized within intact intestinal epithelial cells in animal models of bacterial translocation. although the ability of the enterocyte to engulf bacteria has been well documented in both in  vivo and in vitro experimental models, relatively little is known about the enterocyte's ability to degrade internalized bacteria. intracellular survival of  eight strains of enteric bacteria (two strains of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, two strains of escherichia coli, and two strains of enterococcus faecalis) was quantified over a 20 h period using two different types of terminally differentiated polarized enterocytes considered relevant in vitro models of human small intestinal epithelium, namely caco-2 and  ht-29 cells. caco-2 enterocytes were generally more permissive for bacterial uptake when compared with ht-29 enterocytes. however, bacterial survival was similar within each type of enterocyte, and most strains of enteric bacteria remained viable within enterocytes for the 20 h duration of the assay. in addition, with the exception of one strain of l. monocytogenes in caco-2 cells, intracellular enteric bacteria had no noticeable effect on host enterocyte viability for this 20 h duration. transmission electron microscopy was used to visualize both intact and degraded bacteria within individual enterocytes, suggesting that prolonged bacterial survival might have resulted from simultaneous bacterial degradation and replication. thus, although enterocytes internalize enteric bacteria, enterocytes might not kill internalized bacteria as efficiently as leukocytes. observations of bacterial intracellular survival supported the hypothesis that the enterocyte might be a portal of entry for translocating microbes, and observations of intracellular bacterial degradation might have implications for the role of the enterocyte as an antigen-presenting cell.

TI  == evaluation of chromagar orientation for differentiation and presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli and enterococcus species.
AB  == a new chromogenic plate medium, chromagar orientation, was evaluated for use in the differentiation and presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli and enterococcus species by a multipoint inoculation (replicator) technique. in this  study, 1,404 gram-negative bacilli and 74 enterococcal isolates were tested on chromagar orientation. six control american type culture collection strains were  also included with the testing to ensure quality control of the media. of the escherichia coli isolates (n = 588) tested, 99.3% produced a pink-to-red color. only in four isolates that were o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (onpg) negative did this result differ. proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris were well differentiated on this medium. p. mirabilis (n = 184) produced a clear colony with diffusible brown pigment around the periphery. by contrast, 15 of 16 p. vulgaris isolates produced bluish-green colonies with a slight brown background.  all aeromonas hydrophila isolates (n = 26) tested produced clear to pink colonies at 35 to 37 degrees c. this colony color changed to blue after 2 to 3 h of incubation at room temperature. a. hydrophila exhibited stronger color and better growth at 30 degrees c. serratia marcescens (n = 29) demonstrated an aqua blue color that deepened to a darker blue when exposed to room temperature. all enterococcal isolates (n = 74) resulted in a blue color and gave pinpoint colonies on purity subcultures at 35 to 37 degrees c after 18 h of incubation. similarity in color resulted in failure to discriminate accurately between klebsiella, enterobacter, and citrobacter species. however, these species could be readily differentiated from other members of the family enterobacteriaceae. pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 151) was easily differentiated from members of the enterobacteriaceae but was less easily distinguishable from other gram-negative nonmembers of the enterobacteriaceae. the medium was found to facilitate easy visual detection of mixed bacterial isolates in culture. when used in a replicator system, it easily detected mixed growths of organisms which may have otherwise led to false antibiotic susceptibility results. these mixed growths were not obvious on the routine susceptibility testing medium (isosensitest).

TI  == douglas-fir root-associated microorganisms with inhibitory activity towards fungal plant pathogens and human bacterial pathogens.
AB  == a microbial culture collection composed of 1820 bacterial strains, including 298  actinomycete strains, was established from the roots of douglas-fir (pseudotsuga  menziesii (mirb.) franco) seedlings harvested from conifer nurseries and forest sites. two hundred and thirty-four strains inhibited the growth of fusarium, cylindrocarpon, and (or) pythium spp. in in vitro assays. a significantly greater proportion of bacterial strains from actinomycete genera exhibited antifungal properties compared with bacterial strains from nonactinomycete genera. eighty-nine percent of identified inhibitory strains were streptomyces, streptoverticillium, bacillus, pseudomonas, or burkholderia species. the actinomycete species were isolated almost exclusively from forest seedlings. recovery of inhibitory strains representing 29 microbial species was enhanced using a variety of methods to isolate microorganisms from the roots of seedlings  from nursery and forest sites. bacterial strains (including actinomycete strains) with antifungal activity were tested for in vitro growth inhibition of six clinical human bacterial pathogens (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). forty-eight percent of the tested strains inhibited one or more human pathogens, inhibitory activity towards fungal and bacterial pathogens was strain specific, not species specific, and many inhibitory strains exhibited broad-spectrum activity. strains with antifungal activity against several conifer root pathogens were also more likely to inhibit multiple species of clinical bacterial pathogens.

TI  == treatment of urinary tract infections: selecting an appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic for nosocomial infections.
AB  == clinical and in vitro data indicate that cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, may be a valuable addition in the treatment of serious infections. in this study, hospitalized patients with complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uti), for which parenteral therapy was appropriate, were enrolled in a 2:1 ratio open, randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety  of cefepime and ceftazidime. a total of 180 patients, including 6 with concurrent bacteremia, were evaluated for their response to cefepime (n = 118) or ceftazidime (n = 62), both of which were administered by intravenous infusion or  intramuscular injection in doses of 500 mg every 12 hours. in cases of complicated uti, cefepime produced a satisfactory clinical response in 83 of 93 (89%) patients and eradicated 83 of 98 (85%) pathogens. a satisfactory clinical response to ceftazidime was experienced by 43 of 50 (86%) patients; and in 39 of  50 (78%) cases pathogens were eradicated. in uncomplicated cases, the clinical response and bacterial eradication rates for cefepime were 23 of 25 (92%) and 22  of 26 (85%), respectively, and for ceftazidime 12 of 12 (100%) and 11 of 12 (92%). of the 6 patients with concomitant bacteremia, 5 received cefepime and 1,  ceftazidime. the infecting organisms, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, were eradicated in all cases, although one cefepime-treated patient had an unsatisfactory clinical response. the most common adverse events in both groups were headache, diarrhea, and vomiting; most events were unrelated to therapy. adverse events forced only a 2% withdrawal of patients in either group. there was local tolerance to both agents, and abnormalities in laboratory values were judged to be clinically insignificant. the results of this study indicate that cefepime can be used safely and successfully to treat both complicated and uncomplicated nosocomial infection of the urinary tract, including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia. moreover, its safety profile appears comparable to those of other cephalosporins, and local tolerance is similar to that of ceftazidime. no patient in either group required discontinuation of therapy because of local intolerance at the infusion or injection site.

AB  == objective: to clarify the effect of hypoxia on bacteria-enterocyte interactions.  design: randomized. setting: research laboratory. subjects: enteric bacterial and cultured human intestinal epithelial cells, ht-29 cells. interventions: the effect of hypoxia on bacterial internalization and intracellular survival was studied, using enterocytes cultured for 21 days in either 20%, 10%, or 5% oxygen. the effect of bacterial growth conditions on bacterial internalization by enterocytes was studied, using bacterial cells in either the log phase or stationary phase of aerobic growth, and using bacterial cells in stationary phase, grown either under low oxygen conditions or under anaerobic conditions. measurements and main results: individual strains of enteric bacteria were incubated with ht-29 cells for 1 hr. numbers of internalized bacteria were subsequently quantified after enterocyte lysis. bacterial growth conditions (anaerobic vs. aerobic and log-phase vs. stationary-phase bacterial cells) had no noticeable effect on the numbers of salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli internalized by enterocytes. enterocytes cultivated in 20%,  10%, or 5% oxygen were >95% viable. enterocytes cultivated in 20% oxygen were confluent, but those enterocytes cultivated in hypoxia were not confluent and were fewer in number compared with enterocytes cultivated in normoxia. compared with enterocytes grown in normoxia, enterocytes cultivated in 5% and 10% oxygen internalized greater numbers of each of seven strains of enteric bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes (two strains), enterococcus faecalis (two strains), and p. mirabilis, e. coli (two strains), with statistically significant increases noted for five of these seven bacterial strains. intracellular survival of l. monocytogenes and p. mirabilis was assayed. both species survived intracellularly for 22 hrs, with no noticeable differences in the numbers of intracellular bacteria recovered from enterocytes cultivated in 20%, 10%, and 5%  oxygen. conclusion: these in vitro results suggest that augmented bacterial endocytosis by enterocytes might at least partially explain the increased frequency of bacterial translocation associated with tissue ischemia.

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == concentrations of ceftriaxone (1,000 milligrams intravenously) in abdominal tissues during open prostatectomy.
AB  == ceftriaxone concentrations in abdominal tissues were evaluated at different stages of open prostatectomy. ceftriaxone was administered as antibiotic prophylaxis, and 15 consecutive patients were given a single dose of ceftriaxone  (1,000 mg intravenously in 1 min) 30 min before surgery. ceftriaxone concentrations in tissue were determined at three stages of the surgical procedure; upon the opening of the abdominal cavity, during the prostatectomy, and upon the closure of the abdominal cavity. samples of the following tissues or sample were assayed: epiploic and abdominal-wall fat; retzius' space, bladder, and prostate tissue; and urine. during the different stages of the surgical procedure, for all patients, and in the different tested tissues, ceftriaxone concentrations greater than or equal to the cutoff point (4 micrograms/g of tissue) were measured. the highest concentrations were obtained in the bladder (43 +/- 18 micrograms/g) and in the prostate (35 +/- 18 micrograms/g). in fatty tissues, concentrations were between 13 +/- 5 and 22 +/- 8 micrograms/g. all patients (15 of 15) had ceftriaxone levels in tissue greater than the mics for the potential pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis). in conclusion, during open prostatectomy and  after the use of a single dose of ceftriaxone (1,000 mg), high antibiotic levels  were obtained throughout the surgical procedure in the tissues potentially involved in postoperative infection.

TI  == bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin modulates epithelial permeability and bacterial  internalization by ht-29 enterocytes.
AB  == background & aims: enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis has been associated with  diarrheal disease, and the enterotoxin has a cytopathic effect on cultured ht-29  enterocytes. experiments were designed to determine the effect of b. fragilis enterotoxin on bacteria-enterocyte interactions. methods: confluent ht-29 enterocytes were incubated for 1 hour with b. fragilis enterotoxin, followed by 1 hour of incubation with pure cultures of enteric bacteria, namely, salmonella typhimurium (two strains), listeria monocytogenes (three strains), proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli (three strains), and enterococcus faecalis. enterocyte viability was assessed using vital dyes, epithelial permeability was measured using transepithelial electrical resistance, enterocyte morphology and bacteria-enterocyte interactions were visualized using light and electron microscopy, and bacterial internalization was assessed using a quantitative culture of lysed enterocytes. results: b. fragilis enterotoxin did not affect enterocyte viability but decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and individual enterocytes pulled apart. enterotoxin pretreatment decreased internalization of l. monocytogenes (p < 0.01) but increased (p < 0.01) internalization of the other strains of enteric bacteria. augmented bacterial internalization was associated with preferential bacterial adherence on the exposed lateral surface of enterotoxin-treated enterocytes. conclusions: b. fragilis enterotoxin was associated with ht-29 cell rounding and with augmented internalization of selected strains of enteric bacteria that were preferentially  adherent on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface.

TI  == [evaluation of chromogenic medium cps id2 (biomerieux) in urine cultures].
AB  == background: the aim of the study was to evaluate the chromogenic agar plate cps id2 (biomerieux) and determine its cost-benefit ratio. methods: a total of 2,193  urinary sediments were processed. the urine culture was carried out in cps id2 agar and in cystine-lactose electrolyte deficient (cled) agar, when needed. identification of the microorganisms was performed following standard microbiologic procedures through biochemical tests prepared in our laboratory. the identification, from cps id2 agar, by direct detection in medium of four metabolic activities: beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase, deaminase, and indol  production, was performed following to manufacturer's instructions. results: a total of 289 urine cultures were positive, 18 were negative and 34 were contaminated samples. the identification, directly performed from the colonies detected in cps id2 agar, was correct in 96% of 166 escherichia coli, in 92% of 24 proteus mirabilis and in 97% of 38 enterococci. cps id2 agar exhibited 94% and 100% sensitivity and specificity, respectively in e. coli identification, 92% and 100% in p. mirabilis and 97% and 99% in enterococcus. the use of this new media,  cps id2, in our laboratory, implies a budgetary increment. however, if commercial galleries are used for routine identification, the cost will be reduced using this new media. conclusions: the cps id2 agar allows the isolation and direct identification of the most frequent urinary tract pathogens: e. coli, p. mirabilis and enterococcus in primary isolation medium. using this medium, bacteriologists will be able to save time and reagents when identifying the most  common uropathogens. furthermore, the use of this medium would reduce costs in some laboratories.

TI  == variations in the fluorescence intensity of intact dapi-stained bacteria and their implications for rapid bacterial quantification.
AB  == as current techniques for the quantification of bacteria are laborious and often  imprecise, instrumental approaches such as sedimentation field-flow fractionation (sdfff) are attractive. in this technique, fluorogenic dyes specific for nucleic  acids are used to identify bacterial cells. bacterial biomass can be quantified directly with sdfff if the specific fluorescence of bacterial cells is constant.  the effect of different growth conditions on the specific fluorescence of one strain each of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus epidermidis stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was examined. specific fluorescence varied over a 500-fold range, from 0.22 to 103 arbitrary fluorescence units per cell. specific fluorescence was highest when cells were in log phase, and lowest when cells were in stationary phase. specific fluorescence decreased when cells harvested in log phase were starved for 7 d in  a carbon-free minimal medium, and increased rapidly (within 2 h) after cells were relieved from carbon limitation. such variations in specific fluorescence must be considered when using gross fluorescence as a direct indicator of bacterial numbers in the sdfff technique for quantifying bacterial biomass. moreover, they  have serious implications for the application of fluorescence techniques in other instrumental approaches for bacterial enumeration in environmental samples.

TI  == bacterial reduction of n-oxides of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (tsna).
AB  == 1. contrary to established metabolic pattern, a recent investigation of nnk metabolism produced in rat urine higher levels of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (nnk) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (nnal) than their n-oxides, suggesting that reconversion of n-oxides could occur after urine formation. 2. to verify the possible role of bacteria in the reduction of nnk-n-oxide and nnal-n-oxide to their respective parent compounds, nnk and nnal, in smokers with  urinary tract infection (uti), the n-oxides were isolated from the urine of rats  treated with [5-3h]nnk and individually incubated at 37 degrees c with ten bacterial species in sterile human urine under different ph regimens. after incubation with the bacteria, aliquots of culture media were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) with radiochemical detection. 3. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis possessed varying capacity to regenerate nnk and nnal from their n-oxides while others showed no detectable reductive capability within 24 h. 4. this result constitutes the first experimental evidence that in tobacco users with concomitant uti, bacterial regeneration of the procarcinogenic nnk and nnal  from their n-oxides could occur in the bladder leading to increased carcinogen burden in these individuals.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamase gene blaper-2, which encodes an extended-spectrum class a beta-lactamase.
AB  == plasmidic extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of ambler class a are mostly inactive against ceftibuten. salmonella typhimurium jmc isolated in argentina harbors a bla gene located on a plasmid (pmvp-5) which confers transferable resistance to oxyiminocephalosporins, aztreonam, and ceftibuten. the beta-lactamase per-2 (formerly ceftibutenase-1; cti-1) is highly susceptible to inhibition by clavulanate and is located at a pi of 5.4 after isoelectric focusing. the blaper-2 gene was cloned and sequenced. the nucleotide sequence of a 2.2-kb insert in vector pbluescript includes an open reading frame of 927 bp. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of per-2 with those of other beta-lactamases indicates that per-2 is not closely related to tem or shv enzymes (25 to 26% homology). per-2 is most closely related to per-1 (86.4% homology), an ambler class a enzyme first detected in pseudomonas aeruginosa. an enzyme with an amino  acid sequence identical to that of per-1, meanwhile, was found in various members of the family enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in turkey. our data indicate that per-2 and per-1 represent a new group of ambler class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. per-2 so far has been detected only in pathogens (s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis) isolated from patients in south america, while the incidence of per-1-producing strains so far has been restricted to turkey, where it occurs both in members of the family enterobacteriaceae and in p. aeruginosa.

TI  == evidence that orthotopic transposition following rat heterotopic small bowel transplantation corrects overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == an overgrowth of pathogenic organisms occurs following rat heterotopic small bowel transplantation. this study assessed whether the bacterial microflora return to normal following subsequent orthotopic transposition of the graft. after 14 days the heterotopic graft was placed into continuity following resection of 15 cm of the host midintestinal loop. quantitative and qualitative analyses of the intraluminal bacteria were performed studying the resected host intestine, the heterotopic graft at 14 days, and the graft 14 days after transposition. a group of normal rats were used as controls. an overgrowth of staphylococcus epidermidis evident in the heterotopic graft at 14 days returned to a more normal bacterial profile following orthotopic transposition. these findings suggest that early interposition of a small bowel graft into an orthotopic position may prevent an alteration in the small bowel ecology toward potentially pathogenic organisms capable of translocation.

TI  == effect of urinary tract infection on disintegration of calcium-containing stones.
AB  == to evaluate the possible effect of urinary tract infection (uti) on the fragility of calcium-containing stones (calcium-oxalate, calcium-phosphate), the results of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) therapy in 81 patients with uti and  30 patients with no sign of uti were comparatively evaluated. eswl parameters (shock wave number, kilovolt value, treatment time) and stone-free status during  3 and 6 months of follow-up were assessed for each patient, and the results were  evaluated with respect to stone presence. our results indicated that the presence of uti may decrease stone fragility and increase stone clearance time. we believe that deterioration of peristaltic dynamics in the renal pelvis and the ureteral wall may reveal prolonged stone clearance phases in such patients.

TI  == inhibition of mouse liver cytochrome p-450 by gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharides.
AB  == the ability of bacterial endotoxins, of different origin, to modify the level of  mouse liver cytochrome p-450 was investigated. endotoxins, (lipopolysaccharides,  lpss) were isolated from proteus, escherichia, salmonella, bacteroides and coxiella strains. the most potent inhibitor of cytochrome p-450 activity was s. typhi 0101 lps, which at a dose of 1 microgram/mouse reduced the cytochrome p-450 activity to 59%. e. coli o55:b5, s. typhimurium, p. mirabilis o3, and c. burnetii lpss, at dose 10 micrograms/mouse, decrease cytochrome p-450 level from 56 to 69%. b. ovatus lps significantly suppressed the expression of cytochrome p-450 only at the highest dose used-100 micrograms/mouse. the comparison of inhibitory  activity of p. mirabilis complete, s and r types of lpss indicate that lipid a portion of lpss are sufficient to decrease the cytochrome p-450 level. however, the core oligosaccharide of lps significantly enhance that inhibition. the isolated o-specific polysaccharide part of p. mirabilis o3 lps did not decrease cytochrome p-450 level. the comparison of biological activity of proteus lpss, tested by chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) test, demonstrated the enhancement effect of o-polysaccharide part of tested lpss.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight european countries.
AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

TI  == synthesis and secretion of recombinant penicillin g acylase in bacterial l-forms.
AB  == l-form strains of proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli lacking the cell wall represent an alternative prokaryotic cell system for the production of recombinant proteins (klessen et al. 1988, laplace et al. 1988a, 1989b). we could demonstrate that they are also able to synthesize the enzyme penicillin g acylase (pac)1). pac was processed and secreted into the medium by recombinant l-form strains. the synthesis of pac was growth-associated and stably regulated. expression, secretion, and processing were not temperature-dependent and occurred at 26 degrees c, 32 degrees c and even 37 degrees c. the expression vector phc1 carried the pac gene under the control of the lac uv promotor and a kanamycin resistance gene. it could be maintained in l-form cells, showing low structural as well as segregational instability. the secretion of the biologically active enzyme into the medium indicated that the postranslational processing of the pac  molecule, including the excision of a 54 amino acid spacer peptide between the alpha and beta subunit, is not carried out in the periplasmic space, but occurs at the cytoplasmic membrane or autocatalytically.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the genes encoding the hemolysin of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == we previously identified a heat- and protease-labile haemolytic activity expressed by haemophilus ducreyi. in order to characterize the haemolysin at the  molecular level, genomic dna from h. ducreyi was probed with haemolysin genes from other gram-negative organisms. the haemolysin genes of proteus mirabilis hybridized to h. ducreyi dna suggesting that the haemolysin of h. ducreyi is related to the proteus/serratia pore-forming family of haemolysins. tn916 mutagenesis was employed to isolate haemolysin-deficient mutants. approximately 5000 tn916 transposon mutants were screened for the loss of haemolytic activity and two mutants were identified. one mutant, designated 35,000-1, was further characterized. sequences flanking the tn916 element in strain 35,000-1 were employed to identify clones from a lambda dashii library of h. ducreyi strain 35,000 dna. a 13 kb insert from one lambda clone was selected for further study.  this 13 kb fragment was able to both confer haemolytic activity to escherichia coli and complement the haemolysin deficiency in strain 35,000-1. the haemolysin  gene cluster was cloned from this 13 kb insert and two genes, designated hhda and hhdb, were identified. the derived amino acid sequence of these genes demonstrated homology to the haemolysin and activation/secretion proteins of p. mirabilis and serratia marcescens.

TI  == isolation and sequence analysis of rpoh genes encoding sigma 32 homologs from gram negative bacteria: conserved mrna and protein segments for heat shock regulation.
AB  == the rpoh genes encoding homologs of escherichia coli sigma 32 (heat shock sigma factor) were isolated and sequenced from five gram negative proteobacteria (gamma or alpha subgroup): enterobacter cloacae (gamma), serratia marcescens (gamma), proteus mirabilis (gamma), agrobacterium tumefaciens (alpha) and zymomonas mobilis (alpha). comparison of these and three known genes from e.coli (gamma), citrobacter freundii (gamma) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma) revealed marked similarities that should reflect conserved function and regulation of sigma 32 in the heat shock response. both the sequence complementary to part of 16s rrna (the 'downstream box') and a predicted mrna secondary structure similar to those involved in translational control of sigma 32 in e.coli were found for the rpoh genes from the gamma, but not the alpha, subgroup, despite considerable divergence in nucleotide sequence. moreover, a stretch of nine amino acid residues q(r/k)(k/r)lffnlr, designated the 'rpoh box', was absolutely conserved among all sigma 32 homologs, but absent in other sigma factors; this sequence overlapped with the segment of polypeptide thought to be involved in dnak/dnaj chaperone-mediated negative control of synthesis and stability of sigma 32. in addition, a putative sigma e (sigma 24)-specific promoter was found in front of all rpoh genes from the gamma, but not alpha, subgroup. these results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in e.coli are very well conserved among the gamma subgroup and partially conserved among the alpha proteobacteria.

AB  == performance in terms of enumeration, growth and identification with a new culture medium (cps id2, biomerieux) was evaluated using 405 urine samples and 244 collection strains. the cps id2 medium contains chromogenic substrates enabling the detection of 4 bacterial enzymes which leads to the identification of colonies: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus-morganella-providencia and enterococci. no discrepancies in the enumeration were observed with the collected strains and urine samples. sensibility and specificity of the identification of proteae taxa (tda +) and enterococcal taxa (gram positive cocci and beta-glucosidase +) was 100% using urine samples and 95.1% of e. coli strains (beta-glucuronidase +, indole +) are detected. routine use of this new medium for the bacterial examination of urine is satisfactory and an ultra-violet lamp is no longer required for reading as was the case previously with media containing fluorogenic substrates.

AB  == it has recently been shown that serum antibody levels against proteus mirabilis decreased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who improved clinically during treatment with 7-10 days of fasting followed by a one-year vegetarian diet. as p. mirabilis is commonly implicated in urinary tract infections, this study was carried out to examine whether fasting and vegetarian diet may influence the growth of p. mirabilis and escherichia coli in urine. urine samples were collected from 22 patients who were referred to a health farm for various reasons. the dietary regimen recommended by the health farm consisted of fasting  for 7 to 10 days followed by a vegan diet. the growth of both bacteria in urine samples collected after 8 days was significantly slower than in samples collected at baseline. in urine samples collected after 18 days growth was also reduced, although not significantly for e. coli. our results show that dietary manipulation may reduce the ability of urine to support the growth of p. mirabilis and e. coli.

TI  == in-vitro production of ethanol in urine by fermentation.
AB  == driving while under the influence of alcohol (dui) can lead to serious injuries to the intoxicated driver and surrounding individuals, in addition to revocation  or suspension of driving privileges. the accuracy and interpretation of the testing procedures may be compromised if an individual's urine contains sugar, and either bacteria or yeast. under these conditions, ethanol can be produced in  vitro, producing a result that may be erroneously indicative of dui. in this study three yeast species and six bacterial species were added to a blank urine sample devoid of any alcohol or sugar. samples were incubated at 0, 25, and 35 degrees c for 24, 48, and 144 hours in the presence of one of four different sugars. ethanol concentrations were assayed using an enzymatic alcohol dehydrogenase assay. results showed that when glucose was used as a substrate, all yeast species (candida albicans, candida parapsilosis, and candida sp. not albicans) and three bacterial species (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis) were capable of producing ethanol while the other three (enterococcus sp., staphylococcus sp. not aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were not. the rate of ethanol production is temperature dependent and can be inhibited by storage of samples at 0 degrees c or the use of approximately 1% sodium fluoroide as an antimicrobial agent. many of these species were also able  to use other substrates (sucrose, fructose, and galactose) to produce ethanol by  fermentation.

TI  == characterization of the hemolytic activity of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == h. ducreyi is the causative agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer disease most prevalent in developing countries. chancroid enhances the heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and is identified in focal outbreaks in the united states, but little is known about its pathogenesis. we studied the  hemolysin produced by h. ducreyi because this molecule might be an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of chancroid. ten strains of h. ducreyi were tested on newly devised blood agar plates and were found to have hemolytic activity. we examined the hemolytic activity of h. ducreyi 35000 further and found that it was heat labile, cell associated, greatest at ph 7.0, and produced  in logarithmic- but not stationary-phase cultures. using transposons tn916 and tn1545-delta 3, we have isolated three classes of transposon mutants of strain 35000: those with no detectable hemolytic activity, those with reduced hemolytic  activity, and those with enhanced hemolytic activity. transposon insertions in the nonhemolytic mutants were located in a dna sequence which hybridized to the proteus mirabilis hemolysin gene. analysis of clones containing overlapping sections of this region served to further localize the h. ducreyi hemolysin gene  and allow its expression in escherichia coli and complementation of the nonhemolytic defect in an h. ducreyi mutant. these experiments indicate that h. ducreyi 35000 produces a hemolysin that is related to the calcium-independent hemolysin produced by p. mirabilis. further experiments are needed to define the  similarity of the h. ducreyi hemolysin to other calcium-independent hemolysins and to determine its role in the pathogenesis of chancroid.

AB  == purpose: to determine the effect of iontophoresis (electrical current for therapeutic purposes) on the growth of pathogenic bacteria in human urine. materials and methods: pathogenic bacteria were isolated and inoculated into a dynamic in vitro artificial bladder model. pooled sterile human urine was regulated through the artificial bladder by intravenous tubing and pumps to simulate filling and emptying of the human bladder. the effect of electrical current on bacterial growth in the system was then studied. results: when iontophoresis is applied at low bacterial concentrations ( < 10(8) colony forming units [cfu]/l.), inhibition of bacterial growth occurs. however, when iontophoresis is applied after fulminant growth of bacteria ( > 10(8) cfu/l.), no inhibition of bacterial growth occurs. iontophoresis was not found to enhance the antibacterial action of gentamicin to resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusions: iontophoresis inhibits bacterial growth at low bacterial concentrations. it does not inhibit bacterial growth after infectious levels have been attained, and it does not potentiate the action of gentamicin on resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  == since the discovery of shigella as the aetiologic agent of acute dysentery almost 100 years ago, this organism has been described as a non-motile and nonflagellated organism that invades the human colonic mucosa. in this study, the production of flagella by prototypic strains of all four shigella species and, moreover, by fresh clinical isolates was demonstrated by electron microscopy. the flagellum of shigella (flash) is approximately 10 microns long and 12-14 nm in diameter and is typically seen emanating from one pole of the bacterium. flash is composed of a putative structural polypeptide subunit of 33-38 kda that shares immunological similarities with escherichia coli, salmonella spp., and proteus mirabilis flagellins, and with the recently described recombinant shigella flagellins (flicss and flicsf) expressed in e. coli k-12. a flicss-specific oligo probe hybridized with all four shigella species, while a flicsf probe hybridized  with all shigella flexneri and shigella dysenteriae strains, but not with all shigella sonnei or shigella boydii strains, indicating genetic divergence among their flagellin genes. shigella exhibits motility in low-concentration motility agar under physiological growth conditions. the expression of flash and motility  appears to be strictly regulated by unidentified genetic and environmental factors. these heretofore undescribed features may allow the bacteria to circumvent the natural intestinal mucosal defences leading to bacterial colonization and disease. the motility of shigellae may represent an evolutionary adaptation important for bacterial survival.

TI  == turkey rhinotracheitis virus isolated from broiler chicken with swollen head syndrome in japan.
AB  == turkey rhinotracheitis (trt) virus was first isolated from a commercial broiler chicken with swollen head syndrome (shs) in japan. at the same time, newcastle disease virus (ndv), infectious bronchitis virus (ibv), avian reovirus (arv), escherichia coli (e.coli), morganella morganii, and proteus mirabilis were also isolated from the same broiler chicken. the presence of antibodies to trt virus was confirmed in the sera of 34-day-old chickens of the flock with shs, however the antibodies to trt virus were undetectable in the sera of 17-day-old chickens. in this investigation, we confirmed avian pneumovirus infection in chickens in japan, and the virus and other agents may be considered as a cause of shs.

TI  == proteus mirabilis amino acid deaminase: cloning, nucleotide sequence, and characterization of aad.
AB  == proteus, providencia, and morganella species produce deaminases that generate alpha-keto acids from amino acids. the alpha-keto acid products are detected by the formation of colored iron complexes, raising the possibility that the enzyme  functions to secure iron for these species, which do not produce traditional siderophores. a gene encoding an amino acid deaminase of uropathogenic proteus mirabilis was identified by screening a genomic library hosted in escherichia coli dh5 alpha for amino acid deaminase activity. the deaminase gene, localized on a cosmid clone by subcloning and tn5::751 mutagenesis, was subjected to nucleotide sequencing. a single open reading frame, designated aad (amino acid deaminase), which appears to be both necessary and sufficient for deaminase activity, predicts a 473-amino-acid polypeptide (51,151 da) encoded within an area mapped by transposon mutagenesis. the predicted amino acid sequence of aad did not share significant amino acid sequence similarity with any other polypeptide in the pir or swissprot database. amino acid deaminase activity in both p. mirabilis and e. coli transformed with aad-encoding plasmids was not affected by medium iron concentration or expression of genes in multicopy in fur, cya, or crp e. coli backgrounds. enzyme expression was negatively affected by growth with glucose or glycerol as the sole carbon source but was not consistent  with catabolite repression.

TI  == molecular analysis of a metalloprotease from proteus mirabilis.
AB  == proteus mirabilis is known for its ability to differentiate from swimmer to swarmer cells, a process crucial for the pathogenesis of these bacteria during urinary tract infections. among the many virulence factors produced during swarmer cell differentiation is an extracellular metalloprotease. a cosmid containing a large fragment of p. mirabilis chromosomal dna was obtained by measuring protease expression in recombinant escherichia coli. the recombinant and native enzymes were purified to over 95% homogeneity from culture supernatants by use of phenyl-sepharose affinity chromatography and found to be identical. the activity of the 55-kda enzyme was stimulated by divalent cations (ca2+ > mg2+) and inhibited by a chelator of these cations. the enzyme possesses  substrate specificity for both serum and secretory forms of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) and iga2 as well as igg and, unlike classic iga proteases, digested to completion both human and mouse iga. following subcloning, a 5-kb dna fragment encoding recombinant protease activity was identified by insertional mutagenesis  with tn5. four open reading frames were identified within this 5-kb region by limited nucleotide sequence analysis of dna flanking the transposon. the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the metalloprotease structural gene (zapa) were obtained. computerized homology studies revealed that the p. mirabilis metalloprotein is a member of the serralysin family of proteases and may be part of an operon comprising genes encoding an atp-dependent abc transporter in addition to the metalloprotease. the relevance of the metalloprotease to swarmer cell differentiation and pathogenicity is discussed.

TI  == retrograde transmission of proteus mirabilis during platelet transfusion and the  use of arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction for bacteria typing in suspected cases of transfusion transmission of infection.
AB  == background: when bacteria are found, after a platelet transfusion, in the recipient's blood as well as in the platelet concentrate (pc), a causal relationship is normally suspected, with the pc as the causative agent. the other alternative, that the patient has bacteremia and contaminated the pc, is less well documented in the literature. case report: arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-pcr) was used for testing strains of proteus mirabilis isolated from a patient's blood before and after a platelet transfusion and from  the pc. because of a febrile reaction after a platelet transfusion, bacterial culture was performed on the pc used, showing growth of p. mirabilis. the same species was found in the patient's blood after the transfusion. posttransfusion sepsis caused by a contaminated pc was suspected, and anti-sepsis treatment was given to the recipient. later, it became apparent that the patient had had bacteremia before the transfusion and that p. mirabilis was one of the species in the isolate. with ap-pcr, the identity of the three p. mirabilis isolates could be distinguished. conclusion: ap-pcr is a useful technique for distinguishing the identity of bacterial isolates from patients and blood components. a patient with bacteremia can contaminate a pc in conjunction with a platelet transfusion. with  ap-pcr, the pc could be ruled out as the cause of the posttransfusion sepsis.

TI  == proteus mirabilis urease: operon fusion and linker insertion analysis of ure gene organization, regulation, and function.
AB  == urease is an inducible virulence factor of uropathogenic proteus mirabilis. although eight contiguous genes necessary for urease activity have been cloned and sequenced, the transcriptional organization and regulation of specific genes  within the proteus gene cluster has not been investigated in detail. the first gene, urer, is located 400 bp upstream and is oriented in the direction opposite  the other seven genes, uredabcefg. the structural subunits of urease are encoded  by ureabc. previously, urer was shown to contain a putative helix-turn-helix dna-binding motif 30 residues upstream of a consensus sequence which is a signature for the arac family of positive regulators; this polypeptide is homologous to other dna-binding regulatory proteins. nested deletions of urer linked to either ured-lacz or urea-lacz operon fusions demonstrated that an intact urer is required for urea-induced synthesis of lacz from either urea or ured and identified a urea-regulated promoter in the urer-ured intergenic region. however, lacz operon fusions to fragments encompassing putative promoter regions  upstream of urea and uref demonstrated that no urea-regulated promoters occur upstream of these open reading frames; regions upstream of urer, uree, and ureg were not tested. these data suggest that urer acts as a positive regulator in the presence of urea, activating transcription of urease structural and accessory genes via sequences upstream of ured. to address the role of the nonstructural regulatory and accessory genes, we constructed deletion, cassette, and linker insertion mutations throughout the ure gene cluster and determined the effect of  these mutations on production and regulation of urease activity in escherichia coli. mutations were obtained, with locations determine by dna sequencing, in all genes except urea and uree. in each case, the mutation resulted in a urease-negative phenotype.

TI  == survival of enterobacteria in liquid cultures during microwave radiation and conventional heating.
AB  == bacteria in food have been reported to survive in larger numbers after processing by microwave radiation than after conventional processing. the bactericidal effect of a domestic microwave oven (sharp r-7280) on certain pathogenic enterobacteria species was investigated in vitro, in comparison with conventional heating (boiling). the death rates of different nosocomial strains of escherichia coli, salmonella sofia, salmonella enteritidis, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. the microwave oven and the conventional heating system used were both calibrated in order to calculate temperatures from exposure times. for each strain duplicate samples of 25 ml of pure culture with concentrations at least 10(6) cfu/ml were exposed to microwave radiation. an equal number of samples of the same volume and concentration were exposed to conventional heating. subsequently all samples were examined qualitatively and quantitatively  following standard microbiological procedures. the results indicate that microwaves have an efficient bactericidal effect on the enterobacteria in liquid  cultures.

TI  == exposure of the lateral enterocyte membrane by dissociation of calcium-dependent  junctional complex augments endocytosis of enteric bacteria.
AB  == intestinal bacterial translocation is facilitated in a variety of clinical conditions involving increased intestinal permeability, such as shock and trauma. because there is both in vivo and in vitro evidence that enteric bacteria can be  internalized by intestinal epithelial cells, experiments were designed to test the effect of increased intestinal permeability on enterocyte endocytosis of enteric bacteria. mature, confluent cultures of ht-29 enterocytes were placed in  a calcium-free solution for 1 h. enterocyte viability was not noticeably altered, but transepithelial electrical resistance was significantly decreased (indicating a decrease in epithelial junctional integrity), and the enterocytes were pulled apart. electron microscopic observations revealed enteric bacteria preferentially adherent on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface, and the numbers of viable enteric bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis) internalized by these enterocytes were significantly increased. restoration of calcium restored confluency to enterocyte cultures, and bacterial internalization reverted to control levels. thus, calcium-dependent junctional integrity might play a role in augmenting bacterial translocation in clinical conditions associated with increased intestinal permeability.

TI  == determination of muramic acid in organic dust by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  == a method is described for the quantitation of muramic acid, a marker of bacterial peptidoglycan, in organic dust. house dust samples were hydrolysed in hydrochloric acid and then extracted with hexane to remove hydrophobic compounds. the aqueous phase was evaporated, heated in a silylation reagent to form trimethylsilyl derivatives, and analysed by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. the muramic acid derivative gave two peaks upon injection into the  gas chromatograph--mass spectrometer. injection of 10 pg of the derivative gave a signal-to-noise ratio of 17 for the dominating peak when using selected ion monitoring in the electron impact mode, and a linear calibration curve was achieved upon analysis of samples containing 5-1500 ng of muramic acid. in a house dust sample, 40 ng of muramic acid was found per mg of dust; the coefficient of variation was 8.2% (n = 6, 1.2 mg of dust analysed). the described method is rapid and simple to apply, and should therefore become widely used for  measuring peptidoglycan in many types of environmental samples, including organic dust.

AB  == fifty clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for inhibition of growth of clinical isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella infantis, klebsiella  pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria in the authors' laboratory. pseudomonas aeruginosa was strongly active against both e. coli and enterobacter  cloacae, with 89.4% and 94.7% inhibition respectively, but weakly active against  s. infantis, k. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis with 56.3%, 48.8% and 23.8% inhibition, respectively. the pigmented strains were found to have stronger antimicrobial activity than the unpigmented strains. pyocyanin, the major metabolite of pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to inhibit escherichia coli, proteus spp. and other gram-negative bacteria, by research with a few strains of  p. aeruginosa and a single inhibited strain. however, little attempt has been made to determine the inhibitory action of many strains of p. aeruginosa against  a large number of clinical isolates such as escherichia spp., klebsiella spp., and salmonella spp., up to now. for this reason, in this study we examined 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa for inhibition of growth of  a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including 30 strains of e. coli, 30 of k. pneumoniae, 30 of s. infantis, 6 of enterobacter cloacae and 9 of proteus mirabilis.

TI  == characteristics of ulcers of the small bowel induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the rat: implications for clinical practice.
AB  == small bowel ulcers were created in the rat after the oral administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). of the six nsaids tested, indomethacin and diclofenac alone were associated with such damage which did not  occur in a simple dose-related fashion. bacteria were observed by electron microscopy in an active state of division in the base of the ulcers. when grown aerobically these were shown to be strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. anatomically, nsaid-induced ulcers were found throughout the length of the bowel although more abundant in the proximal half. in vivo and in vitro sensitivity to antibiotics suggested that in addition to the bacteria identified, anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing organisms also have an important role in ulcer production in this model. this rat model of nsaid-induced gut toxicity is discussed in relation to the human situation, particularly for patients who take  nsaids and who have an iron-deficiency anaemia and blood in their faeces, but no  lesions in either the upper or lower bowel.

TI  == studies on microbial aerobic flora of skin in leprosy patients.
AB  == this study reports the isolation and identification of aerobic organisms from biopsies/slit-skin smears/scrapings from 129 leprosy patients and 50 healthy controls. these include 56 paucibacillary (pb) and 73 multibacillary (mb) cases.  thirty-six isolates from the specimens from 21 patients and 15 healthy controls were grown. the non-mycobacterial isolates from clinically pb leprosy (tt/bt/i) patients were: (1) gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus(1), staphylococcus  albus(1); (b) gram-positive bacilli: bacillus subtilis(1), corynebacterium xerosis(1); (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(1), proteus mirabilis(2), klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa(1). the isolates from clinically mb leprosy (bb/bl/ll) patients were: (a) gram-positive cocci: micrococci(1), staphylococcus aureus(1) and staphylococcus albus(1); (b) gram-positive bacilli: corynebacterium xerosis(1); corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and bacillus cereus(1). (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(2), klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and proteus mirabilis(2). the specimens from healthy controls yielded similar organisms. these were (a) gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus albus(2), staphylococcus aureus(2) and micrococci(2); (b) gram-positive bacilli: corynebacterium xerosis(1), bacillus subtilis(2), corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and bacillus cereus(1); (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(3), proteus vulgaris(1) and proteus mirabilis(1). while these results show no significant differences in the species types of non-mycobacterial aerobic organisms isolated from healthy skin and pb/mb types of leprosy, these isolates need to be characterized by immunological/molecular methods to find out  subtypes if any.

TI  == bacterial infection and semen characteristics in infertile men.
AB  == semen samples of 190 men attending an andrology clinic were evaluated with bacteriological culture and categorized as negative (group i) and positive (group ii); the effect of bacteriospemia on semen characteristics was also analyzed. semen samples from both groups were simultaneously analyzed for routine parameters such as volume, sperm count, motility, viability and morphology. the semen culture was negative in 34% and positive in 66% of the samples. from 123 samples, 157 aerobes and 8 anaerobes were recovered. the most commonly isolated organism was staphylococchs epidermidis (in 63% of the samples), followed by streptococchs viridans (28%), escherichia coli (9%), staphylococcus aureus (5%),  streptococcus faecalis (5%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (4%), and enterobacter  agglomerans (4%). other microorganisms, including klebsiella sp, candida sp., and proteus mirabilis, were recovered in fewer than 4% of the specimens. the comparison of semen characteristics between infected and noninfected men showed that motile spermatozoa and viability were lower when the microorganisms were present in the semen. it would appear that the bacteria can have a direct effect  on semen quality with negative consequences in fertility.

TI  == enhancement of uptake of lipopolysaccharide in macrophages by the major outer membrane protein ompa of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies (mab) to lipopolysaccharide (lps) and to the major outer membrane protein ompa from proteus mirabilis were generated and used to monitor the kinetics of uptake in macrophages of lps as well as lps bound to ompa. uptake was measured by a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) in a microtiter culture system. the mab were of various immunoglobulin g subclasses and showed strong reactivities with their antigens. four hybridoma clones recognizing lps and three recognizing ompa from p. mirabilis 19 were selected for the present study on the basis of reactions in elisa and western blot (immunoblot) analyses. in the uptake assay, it was possible to differentiate between antigen on the cell surface and antigen which had been internalized. uptake of lps by macrophages was relatively rapid during the first 4 h of culture and then progressed more slowly over the remaining 24-h observation period. the level of detection of lps in this assay system was in the nanogram range. when macrophages were pulsed with lps for 30 min and subsequently washed to remove antigen not bound to the cells, the amount of lps detectable on the macrophage surface decreased progressively for 3 h after the pulse, which indicated internalization of the antigen. thereafter, lps rose to an increased level on the cell surface. the rate of uptake of lps was more rapid when it was in complex with ompa. when the fate of ompa was monitored in the same lps-protein complexes  by use of mab to ompa in a pulse experiment, the level of protein measured on the cell surface decreased after an initial rise, which again indicated internalization, but the protein did not reappear on the cell surface in a form detectable with the mab. compared with the lps monitoring system, detection of ompa associated with macrophages was weak, although the mab to ompa reacted strongly with the protein in the elisa and western blot analyses.

TI  == comparison of the efficacy and safety of isepamicin and amikacin in the treatment of skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == two hundred and three patients with skin and skin structure infections were treated with isepamicin once daily or amikacin twice daily in an open, randomised, comparative multicentre trial. patients were randomised to treatment  with isepamicin or amikacin in a 2:1 ratio. severe infections (63 patients) were  treated with isepamicin 15 mg/kg once daily (n = 15) or amikacin 7.5 mg/kg twice  daily (n - 18), less severe infections (140 patients) with isepamicin 8 mg/kg once daily (n = 93) or amikacin 7.5 mg/kg twice daily (n = 47). the overall clinical response rate at the end of treatment was excellent in all treatment groups (94-96% cured or improved) with no significant differences between isepamicin and amikacin in patients with either server or less severe infections. the most commonly isolated target pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus. overall, in patients who had a valid target pathogen isolated prior to treatment and who met  other evaluability criteria, bacteriological eradication was achieved in over 90% of patients; amikacin patients with severe infections had a somewhat lower eradication rate (82%). over all infections, 4/110 (4%) patients in the isepamicin group and 5/54 (9%) patients in the amikacin had organisms which persisted. adverse events were reported in 12% of patients in the isepamicin group and 6% in the amikacin group. the most frequently reported adverse event in the isepamicin group as headache. two patients (one in each treatment group), both of whom experienced skin rashes, were withdrawn. potentially clinically significant changes in serum creatinine occurred in two patients, who received isepamicin and one who received amikacin (who was withdrawn from the study). ototoxicity was rare, occurring in one patient treated with isepamicin.

TI  == nucleotide sequences of two fimbrial major subunit genes, pmpa and ucaa, from canine-uropathogenic proteus mirabilis strains.
AB  == proteus mirabilis strains were isolated from dogs with urinary tract infection (uti) and fimbriae were prepared from two strains. the n-terminal amino acid sequences of the major fimbrial subunits were determined and both sequences appeared identical to the n-terminal amino acid sequence of a urinary cell adhesin (uca) (wray, s. k., hull, s. i., cook, r. g., barrish, j. & hull, r. a.,  1986, infect immun 54, 43-49). the genes of two different major fimbrial subunits were cloned using oligonucleotide probes that were designed on the basis of the n-terminal uca sequence. nucleotide sequencing revealed the complete ucaa gene of 540 bp (from strain ivb247) encoding a polypeptide of 180 amino acids, including  a 22 amino acid signal sequence peptide, and the pmpa (p. mirabilis p-like pili)  gene of 549 bp (from strain ivb219) encoding a polypeptide of 183 amino acids, including a 23 amino acid signal sequence. hybridization experiments gave clear indications of the presence of both kinds of fimbriae in many uti-related canine  p. mirabilis isolates. however, the presence of these fimbriae could not be demonstrated in p. vulgaris or other proteus-related species. database analysis of amino acid sequences of major subunit proteins revealed that the ucaa protein  shares about 56% amino acid identity with the f17a and f111a major fimbrial subunits from bovine enterotoxigenic escherichia coli. in turn, the pmpa protein  more closely resembled the pyelonephritis-associated pili (pap)-like major subunit protein from uti-related e. coli. the evolutionary relationship of ucaa,  pmpa and various other fimbrial subunit proteins is presented in a phylogenetic tree.

TI  == experimental investigations on the immunomodulating activity of polybacterial preparation for peroral immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections.
AB  == the immunomodulating effect of a polybacterial immunostimulator urostim in experimental animal models was investigated. the preparation was created for immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections. it consists of killed bacterial cells and their lysates of four microbial species: escherichia coli expressing type 1 pili, rc mutant of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis, balb/c mice and guinea-pigs were treated orally with urostim for 5 or 10 days, respectively. a stimulatory effect of urostim on phagocytosis (increased phagocytic index and phagocytic number) of mice peritoneal exudate cells was observed. an increased number of plaque-forming cells and elevated titres of haemagglutinating antibodies in mice demonstrated activation of humoral immunity. lymphoproliferative studies showed a significant  response to phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and urostim, especially after the second application of the preparation. at the same time no changes in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes were found. an active protection of mice against a systemic infection and of guinea-pigs against uroinfection caused by gram-negative bacteria was obtained. in conclusion, the results obtained characterize urostim as an effective immunostimulator. its peroral application leads to the activation of innate resistance, cell-mediated, humoral and local immunity.

TI  == crystal structure of catalase hpii from escherichia coli.
AB  == background: catalase is a ubiquitous enzyme present in both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells of aerobic organisms. it serves, in part, to protect the cell from the toxic effects of small peroxides. escherichia coli produces two catalases, hpi and hpii, that are quite distinct from other catalases in physical structure and catalytic properties. hpii, studied in this work, is encoded by the kate gene, and has been characterized as an oligomeric, monofunctional catalase containing one cis-heme d prosthetic group per subunit of 753 residues. results:  the crystal structure of catalase hpii from e. coli has been determined to 2.8 a  resolution. the asymmetric unit of the crystal contains a whole molecule, which is a tetramer with accurate 222 point group symmetry. in the model built, that includes residues 27-753 and one heme group per monomer, strict non-crystallographic symmetry has been maintained. the crystallographic agreement r-factor is 20.1% for 58,477 reflections in the resolution shell 8.0-2.8 a. conclusions: despite differences in size and chemical properties, which were suggestive of a unique catalase, the deduced structure of hpii is related to the  structure of catalase from penicillium vitale, whose sequence is not yet known. in particular, both molecules have an additional c-terminal domain that is absent in the bovine catalase. this extra domain contains a rossmann fold but no bound nucleotides have been detected, and its physiological role is unknown. in hpii, the heme group is modified to a heme d and inverted with respect to the orientation determined in all previously reported heme catalases. hpii is the largest catalase for which the structure has been determined to almost atomic resolution.

AB  == igm, igg and iga class serum antibodies against the whole klebsiella pneumoniae,  escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis bacteria, as well as against k. pneumoniae and e. coli lipopolysaccharides (lpss) were studied earlier in the sera of 98 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as) and in 102 healthy blood donors by enzyme immunoassay. in this study the patients were divided into groups according to the clinical picture, i.e. presence or absence of iritis and enthesitis. the previous major finding of increased iga class antibody levels against the whole k. pneumoniae bacteria in as patients when compared to the healthy controls was not specifically associated with any single patient group in the present study. however, the patients with iritis had higher levels of iga class antibodies to lps of k. pneumoniae and e. coli when compared to the patients without iritis. in addition, the patients without enthesitis had higher level of igg class antibodies against whole k. pneumoniae bacteria compared to the patients with enthesitis. the increased iga class antibody levels against k. pneumoniae and e.  coli lps in as patients with iritis may reflect an inflammatory process in the gut area. furthermore, there were certain other differences in the immunological  parameters between the as patients with and without iritis or enthesitis and the  possibility that they reflect different mechanisms involved in the disease processes cannot be excluded.

TI  == effect of salicylate on expression of flagella by escherichia coli and proteus, providencia, and pseudomonas spp.
AB  == osmotic stress, salicylate, and mar (multiple antibiotic resistance) mutation are known to block the expression of the ompf porin. since these conditions have also been shown to inhibit the expression of p and cfa fimbriae in escherichia coli, we speculated that they might affect the expression of flagella as well. hyperosmotic conditions have been shown to block the synthesis of flagellin and expression of flagella in e. coli (c. li, c. j. louise, w. shi, and j. adler, j.  bacteriol. 175:2229-2235, 1993). in the current study, sodium salicylate was found to inhibit the motility of e. coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii in a reversible, concentration-dependent manner. swarming did not occur at 20 mm sodium salicylate. salicylate also blocked the synthesis of flagellin in e. coli. phenotypic mar mutants of e. coli derived from motile strains were amotile. flagella were markedly reduced as determined by scanning electron microscopy when p. mirabilis was grown in broth containing 20 mm salicylate. salicylate had no apparent effect, however, on expression of a 40-kda porin protein in p. mirabilis. this finding suggests that the noted effect of salicylate on proteus spp. may be mediated through a mechanism other than porin production or that the  proteus porin may not be analogous to ompf in e. coli. salicylate decreased the motility of pseudomonas cepacia but had no effect on pseudomonas aeruginosa. the  exact mechanism by which salicylate exerts its effect is not known, but it appears to be related to osmoregulation.

TI  == the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of surgical infections.
AB  == this study examines the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of both gram-negative and gram-positive surgical infections. a dose of 2 g of cefotaxime will sustain peripheral compartment concentrations of 2.6, 3.9, 1.6, and 0.7 micrograms/ml for 6, 8, 10 and 12 h, respectively. therefore, the proportion of pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) below the peripheral compartment cefotaxime concentrations was assessed as a measure of therapeutic potential. it  was observed that bacterial elimination in infections correlates well with such pharmacodynamic predictions. therefore, treatment recommendations for surgical infections are based on the following pharmacodynamics. the times above the mic in the tissue compartment for various pathogens (1988-1994) known to cause surgical infections were: escherichia coli, 12 h; all pyogenic streptococci, 12 h; pneumococci, 12 h; haemophilus spp., 12 h; proteus mirabilis, 12 h; klebsiella spp., 10.9 h; viridans streptococci, 10.6 h; oxacillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.7 h; providencia spp., 9.2 h; clostridium perfringens, 8.6 h; peptostreptococcus spp., 8 h; oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 7.3 h; and all s. aureus, 6.8 h. from the examination of pharmacodynamic parameters, cefotaxime appears to be a viable choice for the therapy of surgical infections other than the gram-negative anaerobes. for those  infections, metronidazole with cefotaxime would be preferred.

(b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

AB  == using a broth microdilution technique, the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine, and combinations of these compounds was determined. the bacterial strains (n = 88) isolated recently from horses with respiratory symptoms belonged to the following species: streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (n = 34), streptococcus equi subsp. equi (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), rhodococcus equi (n = 4), pseudomonas spp. (n = 3) and escherichia coli (n = 3). in addition, two isolates  of enterobacter spp. and one isolate of streptococcus equisimilis, staphylococcus intermedius, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens were examined. for determination of susceptibility of an organism the following minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were fixed as limiting values: trimethoprim < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, sulfadoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, sulfadimethoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadimethoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml. as expected, rhodococcus-equi-isolates were resistant to the antimicrobials tested. however, most of the clinically more common isolates showed a high degree of susceptibility to the combinations. the fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices indicated synergism of the combination-partners in a wide range. according to these in vitro results, application of trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations for the initial therapy of equine respiratory tract infections can be recommended.

TI  == development of wound infection or separation after cesarean delivery. prospective evaluation of 2,431 cases.
AB  == wound infections are a common surgical complication, often requiring a prolonged  hospital stay and leading to increased costs. over a one-year period, 2,431 patients were followed after cesarean delivery with prompt evaluation and culture of all suspicious wounds. seventy subjects (2.8%) developed confirmed wound infection, and 42 (1.7%) developed noninfected open surgical wounds. seven (0.3%) fascial dehiscences were diagnosed, requiring surgical repair. forty of 63 (64%)  infected wounds had positive bacterial cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis  (29%), enterococcus faecalis (17%), staphylococcus aureus (17%), escherichia coli (11%) and proteus mirabilis (10%) the most frequent isolates. only 7 of 42 (17%)  noninfected wounds had positive cultures, with only s aureus, s epidermidis and corynebacterium species isolated. ninety-five percent of the noninfected wounds had blood or serous collections present. rupture of membranes lasting longer than six hours, emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity were associated with a  statistically increased likelihood of the development of infected wounds. emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity, but not prolonged rupture of membranes, were associated with an increased likelihood of the development of noninfected wounds. therefore, it appears that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the development of postcesarean open wounds: (1) increased amniotic fluid and wound colonization due to prolonged rupture of membranes, resulting in a wound infection containing one or more bacterial species derived from the cervicovaginal flora, and (2) increased exogenous bacterial contamination and flora consistent with skin species or breaks in sterile technique, often accompanying difficult or emergency surgery.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

TI  == decrease in anti-proteus mirabilis but not anti-escherichia coli antibody levels  in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with fasting and a one year vegetarian diet.
AB  == objective: to measure proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli antibody levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) during treatment by vegetarian diet. methods: sera were collected from 53 ra patients who took part in a controlled clinical trial of fasting and a one year vegetarian diet. p mirabilis and e coli  antibody levels were measured by an indirect immunofluorescence technique and an  enzyme immunoassay, respectively. results: the patients on the vegetarian diet had a significant reduction in the mean anti-proteus titres at all time points during the study, compared with baseline values (all p < 0.05). no significant change in titre was observed in patients who followed an omnivorous diet. the decrease in anti-proteus titre was greater in the patients who responded well to  the vegetarian diet compared with diet non-responders and omnivores. the total igg concentration and levels of antibody against e coli, however, were almost unchanged in all patient groups during the trial. the decrease from baseline in proteus antibody levels correlated significantly (p < 0.001) with the decrease in a modified stoke disease activity index. conclusion: the decrease in p mirabilis  antibody levels in the diet responders and the correlation between the decrease in proteus antibody level and decrease in disease activity supports the suggestion of an aetiopathogenetic role for p mirabilis in ra.

AB  == monoclonal antibodies (mabs) specific for pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens were  produced by immunizing balb/c mice with a crude whole cell extract. hybrids secreting mabs specific for p. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from p. pseudomallei, p. cepacia, p. aeruginosa, p. putida, p. alcaligenes, xanthomonas maltophilia, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhi, s. krefeld, s. enteritidis, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. of the six specific clones, clone 5f8, which was igm-producing and which reacted with all 56 p. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. results obtained from the indirect elisa against various p. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5f8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. the antibody could be readily used to identify p. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. the antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect elisa that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis.

TI  == requirement for flha in flagella assembly and swarm-cell differentiation by proteus mirabilis.
AB  == swarming by proteus mirabilis is characterized by cycles of rapid population migration across surfaces, following differentiation of typical rods into long, aseptate swarm cells that overexpress flagella and virulence factors, particularly haemolysin. a non-swarming tn5phoa mutant was unable to synthesize flagella, to fully elongate or to induce high levels of the toxin. the mutation lay within a 2091 bp gene encoding a homologue of the escherichia coli flha belonging to a family of proteins that are required for assembly of flagella or virulence proteins and that are suggested to act either directly in membrane translocation and/or in regulating synthesis of the export apparatus. in trans expression of multicopy flha restored cell elongation and migration and generated differentiation-specific hyperexpression of flagellin and toxin genes to levels above those seen in the wild-type strain. transcription of flha was strongly induced during differentiation, from its own putative sigma 28 promoter. the results suggest a mechanistic coupling of flagella assembly and swarm-cell differentiation.

AB  == in 5 mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, 4 centers in greece, 3 centers in spain, and 1 center in lebanon and saudi arabia contributed  to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (sceptor, bbl, heidelberg, frg). the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (n = 1267), proteus mirabilis (n = 843), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric salmonella spp. (n = 629), enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), citrobacter freundii (n = 383), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 246), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and shigella spp. (n = 185). statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. the penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the  gram-positive cocci, exceeding the mic90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. regarding the gram-negatives (above all klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (mic90 = 1 mg/l). regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. there was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates (mic90 = 2 mg/l). by far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  == many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. it has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary ph, with consequent stone formation. unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g.  escherichia coli). it has been recently reported that e. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. this study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and micrococcus luteus. subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (p < 0.003) reduce the uk activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. the urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, m. luteus, was, however,  the exception (p = 0.1079). in contrast to s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and m. luteus (p < 0.0213), p. mirabilis and s. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase  activity (p < 0.4047). these results may explain why proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. according to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. these conditions may lead to renal stone formation. an increase in urinary ph resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. it is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double  role in renal stone formation.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the napa acid phosphatase/phosphotransferase of morganella morganii: identification of a new family of bacterial acid-phosphatase-encoding genes.
AB  == the gene encoding a minor phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase (named napa) of morganella morganii was cloned and sequenced, and its product characterized. napa is a secreted acid phosphatase composed of four 27 kda polypeptide subunits. the enzyme is active on several organic phosphate monoesters but not on diesters, and is also endowed with transphosphorylating activity from organic phosphoric acid esters to nucleosides and other compounds with free hydroxyl groups. its activity is inhibited by edta, inorganic phosphate, nucleosides and ca2+, but not by fluoride or tartrate, and is enhanced by mg2+, co2+ and zn2+. at the sequence  level, the napa enzyme did not show similarities to any other sequenced bacterial phosphatases. however, a search for homologous genes in sequence databases allowed identification of two open reading frames located within sequenced regions of the escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis genomes respectively, encoding proteins of unknown function which are highly homologous to the morganella enzyme. moreover, the properties of the napa enzyme are very similar to those reported for the periplasmic nonspecific acid phosphatase ii of salmonella typhimurium (for which no sequence data are available). these data point to the existence of a new family of bacterial acid phosphatases, which we propose designating class b bacterial acid phosphatases.

AB  == strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae, mostly from complicated urinary tract infections, showed reduced adherence to silver-treated silicone or latex catheters as compared with latex or silicone catheters. the relative degrees of cell adherence to catheters at 2 h or 18 h, as indicated by radiolabeled cell assays, were in general agreement with growth rate-reduction assays and scanning-electron-microscopy data. for strains of e. coli, the correlation between cell hydrophobicity and degree of adherence to catheters was not significant. antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, sulfathiazine, neomycin, kanamycin) and silver resistance were not associated. the radiolabel adherence procedure provided a quantitative method for evaluating the relative antimicrobial efficacy of silver-treated catheters.

AB  == extracellular fibrils are involved in cell cohesion and cell development in myxococcus xanthus. one group of social motility mutants, dsp, is unable to produce extracellular fibrils; these mutants also lose the abilities to cohere and to develop. extracellular fibrils isolated from vegetative wild-type cells and added to dsp cells fully restored the abilities of these cells to cohere and  to undergo normal morphological development. the fibrils thus mimic the ability of intact, wild-type cells to carry out the same rescue. optimal cohesion rescue  by fibrils required calcium and magnesium ions, did not require protein synthesis, but was energy dependent, i.e., sodium azide and sodium cyanide blocked rescue. cohesion rescue was also blocked by the diazo dye congo red. cohesion rescue is genus specific, i.e., isolated fibrils did not cause the cohesion of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, or the related myxobacterium stigmatella aurantiaca. developmental rescue of dsp by isolated fibrils included aggregation, fruiting body formation, and myxospore morphogenesis. developmental gene expression in the dsp mutant was only partially rescued by the isolated fibrils.

TI  == single-step purification of proteus mirabilis urease accessory protein uree, a protein with a naturally occurring histidine tail, by nickel chelate affinity chromatography.
AB  == proteus mirabilis urease, a nickel metalloenzyme, is essential for the virulence  of this species in the urinary tract. escherichia coli containing cloned structural genes urea, ureb, and urec and accessory genes ured, uree, uref, and ureg displays urease activity when cultured in m9 minimal medium. to study the involvement of one of these accessory genes in the synthesis of active urease, deletion mutations were constructed. cultures of a uree deletion mutant did not produce an active urease in minimal medium. urease activity, however, was partially restored by the addition of 5 microm nicl2 to the medium. the predicted amino acid sequence of uree, which concludes with seven histidine residues among  the last eight c-terminal residues (his-his-his-his-asp-his-his-his), suggested that uree may act as a ni2+ chelator for the urease operon. to exploit this potential metal-binding motif, we attempted to purify uree from cytoplasmic extracts of e. coli containing cloned urease genes. soluble protein was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, a metal chelate resin with high affinity for polyhistidine tails, and bound protein was eluted with a 0 to 0.5 m  imidazole gradient. a single polypeptide of 20-kda apparent molecular size, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-10 to 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was eluted between 0.25 and 0.4 m imidazole. the n-terminal 10 amino acids of the eluted polypeptide exactly matched the deduced amino acid sequence of p. mirabilis uree. the molecular size of the native protein was estimated on a superdex 75 column to be 36 kda, suggesting that the protein is a dimer. these data suggest that uree is a ni(2)+-binding protein that is necessary for synthesis of a catalytically active urease at low ni(2+) concentrations.

TI  == the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole inhibits acid survival of helicobacter pylori by a urease-independent mechanism.
AB  == background/aims: omeprazole, a benzimidazole proton pump inhibitor, has an antibacterial effect against helicobacter pylori at neutral ph and inhibits its urease activity. the aim of this study was to characterize h. pylori acid resistance and to determine whether omeprazole effects its survival at low ph. methods: we studied survival of h. pylori and other enteric organisms in buffered solutions (ph 2-7) in the presence or absence of 10 mmol/l urea and/or omeprazole. results: in the absence of urea, the acid tolerances of wild-type h.  pylori, a urease-negative h. pylori mutant, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were similar. in the presence of urea, the survival of the wild-type h. pylori at ph 2 was significantly greater than that of the other organisms. omeprazole (100 micrograms/ml) had a marked inhibitory effect on the survival of  both wild-type and urease-negative h. pylori at low ph, and similar effects on e. coli, p. mirabilis, and salmonella typhimurium. conclusions: whereas survival of  h. pylori below ph 4 is urease dependent, h. pylori uses non-urease-mediated mechanisms at or above ph 4. omeprazole inhibits the survival of h. pylori at low ph through a mechanism independent of its effect on urease, an antibacterial effect that extends to other enteric bacteria.

TI  == virulence determinants of uropathogenic escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the urinary tract is among the most common sites of bacterial infection and e. coli is by far the most common infecting agent. in patients with urinary catheters in place or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, proteus mirabilis is also a frequent isolate. to study virulence of these bacterial species, we have isolated the genes that encode putative virulence factors, constructed specific mutations within these genes, introduced the mutation back into the wild type strain by allelic exchange, and analyzed these mutants for virulence in appropriate in vitro and in vivo models. specific virulence markers  have been identified for strains that cause urinary tract infection. for e. coli, these include p fimbriae, s fimbriae, hemolysin, aerobactin, serum resistance, and a small group of o-serotypes. redundant virulence factors must be present in  these organisms as mutation of the most clearly identified epidemiological marker, p fimbriae, does not result in attenuation of a virulent strain. for p. mirabilis, urease appears to contribute most significantly to virulence. fimbriae play a significant but more subtle role in colonization. hemolysin, although potently cytotoxic to renal cells in vitro, does not appear to contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of ascending urinary tract infection. we can conclude that the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection and acute pyelonephritis caused by uropathogenic e. coli and p. mirabilis are multifactorial, as mutation of single genes rarely causes significant attenuation of virulence.

AB  == cell-free hemoglobin (hb) is a purified preparation of human hemoglobin that is being developed as a resuscitation fluid. in vivo administration of hemoglobin has resulted in significant toxicity, due in part to contamination with bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (lps)). to better understand this toxicity, we have studied the interaction between hb and lps. mixtures of each of three different hb preparations (cross-linked alpha alpha hb, cross-linked carbon monoxy-alpha alpha hbco, and non-cross-linked (native) hbao) and lps (escherichia coli o26:b6  or proteus mirabilis s1959) were examined by several independent methods for evidence of hb.lps complex formation. binding assays in microtiter plates demonstrated saturable binding of lps to immobilized hb, with a kd of 3.1 x 10(-8) m. binding of lps to hb also was demonstrated wiht a radiolabeled lps photoaffinity probe. ultrafiltration of hb/lps mixtures by 300- and 100-kda cut-off membranes showed that the majority of lps in these mixtures (87-97 and 64-72%, respectively) was detected in the filtrates, in contrast to the lack of filterability of lps in the absence of hb. density centrifugation demonstrated that lps co-migrated with each of the three hbs, whereas unbound lps had a distinctly greater sedimentation velocity than hb or hb.lps complexes. nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that in the presence of hb, lps migrated into the gel and co-electrophoresed with hb, whereas lps alone did not appreciably enter the gel. finally, precipitation by ethanol of each of the three hb preparations was increased in the presence of lps compared with precipitation in the absence of lps. interaction of lps with each of the three hb preparations was also associated with altered biological activity of lps, as shown by enhancement of lps activation of limulus amebocyte lysate. therefore, our data provide several lines of independent evidence for hb-lps complex formation and indicated that lps exhibited altered physical characteristics and enhanced biological activity in the presence of hb.

TI  == [experimental study on the role of bacteria from urinary tract infections on the  bladder carcinogenesis].
AB  == the role of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection (uti) was studied with a view to the possibility that such bacteria are an etiological  factor in the development of bladder cancer. the bacterial strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis, isolated from patients with uti at the kyushu university hospital, were tested for their nitrate-reducing activity after 1 hr of incubation with sodium nitrate (3.57 mm) in a growth medium (ph 7.2) at 37 degrees c. of 35 strains tested, 27 strains (77%) showed the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite with yields ranging from 2 to 310 microm no2-/hr/10(7) bacterial cells, but in 8 strains (23%) including all the 7 strains of e. faecalis no elevated activity (0.0-0.3 microm) could be detected. various kinetic profiles were observed for the nitrate-reducing bacteria, at various rate ranging from rapidly to slowly, during 5 hr of incubation. the effect of nitrate-reducing bacteria on mutagen formation in the human urine was examined. the mutagenic activity of smokers' or non-smokers' urine incubated with or without bacteria for 72 hr at 37 degrees c was assayed by the ames salmonella/microsome test (using ta100 or ta98 with s9-mix). the mutagenic activity increased in urine incubated with the nitrate-reducing s. marcescens or  p. aeruginosa, compared to controls which were incubated without bacteria. potent mutagenic activity could be induced when the urine concentrate prepared from smokers' urine with an xad-2 resin column was incubated with sodium nitrite (40 mm) at ph 3 for 4 hrs. the potent mutagenic activity observed here seems to be due to the class of direct-acting mutagen(s), because no metabolic activation was required. the mutagen formation at an optimal ph 4 proceeded rapidly during 4 hrs of incubation, but decreased thereafter. it was noted that even at a physiological ph 6 of human urine, a lower but significant level of mutagenic activity could still be detected. the mutagenic activity of individual urine concentrate from 14 male smokers and from 6 male non-smokers was assayed after 30 min of incubation with or without sodium nitrite (40 mm) at ph 6. mutagenic activity increased in most of these urine concentrates incubated with sodium nitrite. the levels were variable between individuals with a 1.3- to 53-fold increase compared with the controls incubated without sodium nitrite.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the single-stranded-dna-binding proteins (ssb) of proteus mirabilis and serratia  marcescens.
AB  == the single-stranded-dna-binding (ssb) proteins from proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens were purified from overproducing escherichia coli strains, which were devoid of their own ssb gene. the strains harboured an enda insertion  mutation and a xona mutation resulting in the absence of endonuclease i and exonuclease i activities from the preparations. the amino acid sequences of the ssb of all three species are nearly identical in the n-terminal parts of the proteins that contain the dna-binding domain, but differ in the c-terminal parts. both proteins have an apparent binding-site size of 65 and 35 nucleotides at high and low salt concentrations, respectively. the association-rate constant for binding to poly(dt) is 3.2 x 10(8) m-1 s-1 for p. mirabilis ssb (pmissb) and 3.4  x 10(8) m-1 s-1 for s. marcescens ssb (smassb). these binding parameters are very similar to those of e. coli ssb (ecossb). the structural similarity of the proteins is also documented by the finding that they can exchange subunits among  each other to form mixed tetramers. the transcriptional regulation of the ssb and uvra genes from p. mirabilis and s. marcescens in sos-induced e. coli cells was studied using lacz fusions. while the uvra genes were inducible, there was no induction of the ssb genes transcribed divergently from the uvra genes. apparently, regions with nucleotide sequence similarity to the e. coli sos-box preceding the ssb genes of p. mirabilis and s. marcescens had no gross effect on  the transcription. studies on growth of the cells and recovery from ultraviolet damage indicate that the heterologous ssb proteins support dna replication and recombinational dna repair of e. coli with the same efficiency as the e. coli ssb protein. interactions with other e. coli proteins involved in these processes either do not occur, or are not impeded.

TI  == analysis of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable peptidoglycan autolysins of select  gram-negative pathogens by using renaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == for the first time, peptidoglycan autolysins from cellular fractions derived from sonicated cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, escherichia coli w7, klebsiella pneumoniae cwk2, and proteus mirabilis 19 were detected and partially  characterized by zymogram analysis. purified murein sacculi from p. aeruginosa pao1 were incorporated into a sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gel at  a concentration of 0.05% (wt/vol) to serve as a substrate for the separated autolysins. at least 11 autolysin bands of various intensities with m(r)s ranging between 17,000 and 122,000 were detected in each of the homogenated cultures. some of the autolysins of the four bacteria had similar m(r)s. the zymogram analysis was used to show that a number of the autolysins from e. coli were inhibited by the heavy metals hg2+ and cu2+, at 1 and 10 mm, respectively, high ionic strengths, and reagents known to affect the packing of lipopolysaccharides. the activity of an autolysin with an m(r) of 65,000 was also impaired by penicillin g, whereas it was enhanced by gentamicin. a preliminary screen to determine the relationship between penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) and autolysins was carried out by using a dual assay in which radiolabelled penicillin v bands were visualized on an autolysin zymogram. radiolabelled bands  corresponding to pbps 3, 4, 5, and 6 from e. coli and p. aeruginosa; pbps 3, 4, and 6 from proteus mirabilis; and pbp 6 from k. pneumoniae degraded the murein sacculi in the gels and were presumed to have autolytic activity, although the possibility of two distinct enzymes, each with one of the activities, comigrating in the sds-polyacrylamide gels could not be excluded. some radiolabelled bands possessed an mr of <34,000 and coincided with similar low-mr autolysin bands.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. the study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). in addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent  of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. the organisms tested  were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups c and g, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of  the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. cefpodoxime  showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral  beta-lactam antibiotics examined. the drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.

TI  == genes encoding high-molecular-weight adhesion proteins of nontypeable haemophilus influenzae are part of gene clusters.
AB  == we previously reported the cloning and sequencing of genes designated hmw1 and hmw2 from a prototype nontypeable haemophilus influenzae strain. the genes encode proteins which are related to filamentous hemagglutinin of bordetella pertussis and promote attachment of the nontypeable h. influenzae strain to human epithelial cells (j. w. st. geme iii, s. falkow, and s. j. barenkamp, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 90:2875-2879, 1993). subcloning studies suggested that correct processing of these high-molecular-weight proteins required the products of additional downstream genes. in the present study we analyzed the 3'-flanking regions of the hmw1a and hmw2a structural genes and found that both genes are flanked by two additional downstream open reading frames (orfs), designated b and c, respectively. the b orfs are 1,635 bp long. their derived amino acid sequences are 99% identical and demonstrate similarity to the derived amino acid sequences  of two genes that encode proteins required for secretion and activation of hemolysins of proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens. the c orfs are 1,950 bp  long, and their derived amino acid sequences are 96% identical. in escherichia coli transformants, interruption of the hmw1c or both the hmw1b and hmw1c genes resulted in defective processing of the hmw1a structural gene product and loss of the ability of the transformants to adhere to human epithelial cells. the precise interactions of the proteins encoded by these gene clusters are yet to be defined, but their elucidation may further our understanding of the biology of nontypeable h. influenzae bacteria and the interaction of these organisms with the human host.

TI  == bees aren't the only ones: swarming in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == swarming is a form of active surface motility that is widespread among flagellated, gram-negative bacteria. in the laboratory, growth of the bacteria on certain agar surfaces leads to induction of the differentiated swarmer-cell state. swarmer cells are generally long and multinucleate, always hyperflagellated, and can move rapidly over the agar surface in a coordinated manner. some swarm colonies exude large amounts of 'slime', which could be essential for promoting intimate cell-cell contacts during swarming. there is evidence that the differentiated swarmer-cell stage facilitates pathogenic associations with host tissue. almost nothing is known about the molecular signalling mechanism of surface sensing. increased viscosity appears to be sensed by several bacteria, but other environmental cues, specific to each bacterium, are also important. in organisms in which swarming motility has been studied in some detail, the chemotaxis system has been shown to play an important role. the  recent discovery of swarming motility in two genetically well-characterized organisms--escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium--should lead to rapid progress in understanding this process.

TI  == the features and aetiology of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == this paper reports a clinical study of 20 cases of gangrenous ulcers of the scrotum and/or of the penis (fournier's gangrene) and a review of previous publications. even though found mostly in elderly male patients, the disease spares no age group and can involve the external genitalia in neonates and women  as well. the disease is a necrotising fasciitis of infective origin and always has a portal of entry of the infecting organisms even though it may be so trivial as to be undetected. the commonest portals of entry of infection are periurethral sepsis, groin wound sepsis, anorectal sepsis, prostatic sepsis and trauma. the infecting organisms comprise both aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcus. fournier's gangrene is probably the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis occurring in other parts of the body, but modified by the peculiar anatomy of the genitoperineum.

AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of isepamicin (isp), mics of isp as well  as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many strains of gram-negative bacilli that were clinically isolated in 1993. 1. no isp-resistant  strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp. or proteus mirabilis. 2. isp-resistant strains were observed among isolates of citrobacter freundii, serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the frequency of resistant strains in each species, however, was lower for isp than other ags. 3. when mic90s were compared, antibacterial activities of isp determined in this study were quite similar to those determined during the drug's development period (1980's) in japan, suggesting no increase in the number of isp-resistant strains over the years. 4. the number of clinically isolated gram-negative bacilli resistant to multiple drugs are increasing in from year to  year japan. our results in this study suggest that antibacterial activities of isp may be potent enough against such gram-negative bacilli resistant to multiple drugs.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of arbekacin (abk) against various clinical isolates, 335 strains obtained in 1991, were determined and the reliability of the abk disk susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied. in addition, clinical significance of two different systems for the interpretation of the disk tests was evaluated as to which system would be more useful for the evaluation of clinical efficacy of abk. the 4 category system used in japan, and  the system proposed by the japanese society for antimicrobial chemotherapy were studied. in this study, mics were determined using the mueller-hinton agar containing 50 mg/l of ca and 25 mg/l of mg at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml.  mic90 values of abk against staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. those against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris,  enterobacter spp., and citrobacter spp., were also < or = 3.13 micrograms/ml. mic90 values against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp. were both 50 micrograms/ml. the disk susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the showa disk manual. the inhibition zones obtained with the disk method were compared with mics. results of abk disk susceptibility test with 30,  10, 5 or 2 micrograms disks were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disk method in estimating approximate values of mics (r = -0.627 approximately -0.724, p < 0.01). in the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in mic values of abk proposed are (+ + +) mic < 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic > 3-10 micrograms/ml, (+) mic > 10-50 micrograms/ml and (-) mic > 50 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with showa 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 13.4%, and false negative in 3.9% of the samples. with 10 micrograms disks, false positive and false negative were 8.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. similarly, those with 5 micrograms and 2 micrograms disks were 6.9% and 7.2%, and 3.0% and 14.6%, respectively. in the break point classification system of japanese society for antimicrobial chemotherapy, the mic break point for abk proposed is 2 micrograms/ml. it appeared to be difficult to make out this break point on the inhibition zone diameters obtained with various disks used, since there were no significant difference in the inhibition zone diameters against strains with mic values ranging 0.39-3.13 micrograms/ml. a pharmacokinetic examination with the recommended dose schedule for abk (100 mg i.m. or i.v.) showed that plasma levels of abk reached 3.7-11.3 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == bacteriuria in patients with a continent ileal reservoir for urinary diversion does not regularly require antibiotic treatment.
AB  == objective: to elucidate the importance of bacteriuria in patients with a continent urinary diversion. patients and methods: eighteen asymptomatic patients (16 women and two men, with a mean age of 53 years [range 22-73]) with ileal reservoirs coupled to the skin for urinary diversion were studied. consecutive urine cultures were performed over 5 months. concomitant measurements of antibody titres against escherichia coli and proteus, and c-reactive protein (crp) values  were made. results: the results of the urine cultures varied considerably between samples. increased titres of antibodies against e. coli were seen in several patients but the correlation with bacteriuria caused by e. coli was weak (sensitivity 33%, specificity 56%). increased titres of antibodies against proteus were rarely seen and in no patient correlated with bacteriuria caused by  proteus. increased levels of crp were seen in three patients. conclusion: the present results indicate that asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with a continent ileal reservoir for urinary diversion is generally of no clinical importance and should not be treated with antibiotics. this conclusion is based on the observations that the bacterial strains growing in the reservoir changed spontaneously indicating colonization rather than infection. raised titres of antibodies against e. coli correlated weakly with bacterial growth. the observed  elevations in antibody titres were usually just above the normal upper limit.

AB  == over a period of one month, five isolates of proteus mirabilis resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins colonized or infected five patients of the same  intensive care unit. the antibiotic resistance phenotype and the metabolic profiles of the five strains were identical. all five produced a plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase closely related to tem-3/ctx-1 according to its  pi (6.3), to its substrate profile and to the hybridization of the corresponding  gene with blatem-3 specific oligonucleotide probes. ability to produce this enzyme transferred by conjugation to escherichia coli along with aminoglycoside and sulphonamide resistance. these resistance markers were encoded by a plasmid,  (pap1) which was identical in all five isolates but which was different from the  tem-3 beta-lactamase plasmids found in other enterobacteriaceae. plasmid pap1 differed by its smaller size (47 kb), its ecori restriction pattern, its resistance co-markers (aac(6') and sulphonamide only) and its much lower transfer frequency (2 x 10(-8)). furthermore this plasmid did not belong to any known enterobacteriaceae incompatibility group.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

AB  == we reviewed the records of fifty-five children, including eleven infants (three of whom were neonates), who had at least one skeletal manifestation of hematogenous osteomyelitis. forty-two of the patients were boys and thirteen were girls. the patients were classified into three groups: those who had early acute, those who had late acute, and those who had chronic osteomyelitis. this classification system was based on clinical and radiographic criteria. seven patients had early acute osteomyelitis; eighteen, late acute osteomyelitis; and thirty, chronic osteomyelitis. the bones most often affected were the tibia (twenty-two patients) and the femur (nineteen patients). penicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus grew on culture of specimens of purulent material from twenty-nine (76 per cent) of thirty-eight patients. escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter grew on culture of specimens of purulent material from one patient each. six cultures showed no growth. no purulent material was obtained from seventeen of the fifty-five patients. the seven patients who had early acute osteomyelitis, and four of the eighteen patients who had late acute osteomyelitis, responded well to antibiotic treatment only. a combination of antibiotic and operative treatment was needed in fourteen of the eighteen patients who had late acute osteomyelitis and in all thirty patients who had chronic osteomyelitis. forty-nine of the fifty-five patients were followed for two years; the remaining six patients were lost to follow-up. the two-year results were good in nineteen of the twenty-three patients who had acute (early or late) osteomyelitis and in fifteen of the twenty-six patients who had chronic  osteomyelitis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the gene of proteus mirabilis coding for a single-stranded dna-binding protein (ssb) was cloned in escherichia coli from a genomic library. it restored the uv resistance and the rate of cell division of an e. coli ssb-113 mutant to the same extent as the cloned e. coli ssb+ gene did. an e. coli mutant with deleted ssb was viable with the p. mirabilis ssb+ gene provided on a single-copy-number plasmid and had the same cell division rate as with the e. coli ssb+ gene on the  same vector plasmid. the recovery from uv damage of an excision repair deficient  (uvra) mutant deleted for the ssb gene was identical with the ssb+ gene from p. mirabilis or e. coli, suggesting full substitution in recombinational dna repair  of the homologous by the heterologous ssb protein. the nucleotide sequence of the gene revealed that the ssb has 81% amino acid sequence homology with the e. coli  ssb and only 58-63% with various plasmid ssbs. the data provide evidence that the bacterial chromosomally coded ssbs and the plasmid encoded ssbs constitute separate groups.

TI  == cefuroxime axetil.
AB  == cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from  the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin c. cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. the majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. these include haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and the  other streptococci (excluding group d streptococci), and moraxella catarrhalis. bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella and shigella and straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). the pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. the absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. the protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. an oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available  as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). cefuroxime axetil  is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic  bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). for most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate.  in some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. if pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. adverse reactions to  cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).

TI  == in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  == in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of  cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal  activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large  bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.

TI  == effect of lipopolysaccharide (lps) chain length on interactions of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein and its bioactive 23-kilodalton nh2-terminal fragment with isolated lps and intact proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli.
AB  == the target-specific cytotoxicity for gram-negative bacteria and the endotoxin-neutralizing activity of the 55-kda bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi) and its bioactive 23-kda nh2-terminal fragment depend on the strong attraction of bpi for the lipid a region of lipopolysaccharides (lps). we have shown before that smooth gram-negative bacteria with long-chain lps are more resistant to bpi (especially  holo-bpi) than are rough strains. it has been suggested that the high bpi resistance of some gram-negative bacteria, such as proteus mirabilis, might also  reflect the structural diversity of lipid a. to explore this possibility, we compared the antibacterial activity and binding of natural and recombinant holo-bpi and a recombinant nh2-terminal fragment (rbpi-23) to an isogenic rough (re-lps chemotype) and a smooth (s-lps chemotype) strain of p. mirabilis and to lps isolated from the two strains. holo-bpi and rbpi-23 were both potently active against the re strain of p. mirabilis (90% lethal dose, 20 nm). in contrast, the  smooth strain was > or = 100 times more resistant to holo-bpi but only 10 times more resistant to rbpi-23. rbpi-23 was also more potent against several escherichia coli strains from clinical bacteremia isolates. differences in the antibacterial potency of bpi toward the re and s strains of p. mirabilis correlated with differences in the binding of holo-bpi and rbpi-23 to these bacteria. in contrast, the binding of biosynthetically (in vitro transcribed and  translated) 35s-labeled holo-bpi and nh2-terminal fragment to isolated re- and s-lps from p. mirabilis in solution was similar. moreover, in the limulus amebocyte lysate assay, holo-bpi and rbpi-23 potently neutralized both forms of lps with equal effectiveness. together, these results strongly suggest that bpi recognizes proteus lipid a and that the relative resistance of (smooth) p. mirabilis to holo-bpi is due to the inhibitory effect of long polysaccharide chains of tightly packed lps in the envelope.

TI  == mutational analysis of the bordetella pertussis fim/fha gene cluster: identification of a gene with sequence similarities to haemolysin accessory genes involved in export of fha.
AB  == the chromosome of bordetella pertussis harbours a region of 27 contiguous kb, which contains the bvg, fha and fim genes, involved in the co-ordinate regulation of virulence genes, fha production and fimbriae production, respectively. the linkage of fha and fimbrial genes has resulted in some confusion concerning the existence and location of genes required for the production of fha and the function of the fimbrial genes fimb-d, which were proposed to be involved in both fha and fimbriae biosynthesis. through the use of non-polar mutations in each of  these genes, we found that fimb-d are required for the production of both serotype 2 and 3 fimbriae, but not for fha biosynthesis. furthermore, a large open reading frame, designated fhac, was identified downstream of fimd. it was shown that fhac is essential for fha production but not for fimbriae biogenesis.  we propose that insertion mutations in fimb-d affect fha production because of polar effects on fhac expression. an insertion in the region downstream of fhac had only a slight effect on fha and fimbriae production. the fhac gene product shows homology with shib and hpmb, two outer membrane proteins involved in export and activation of the haemolysins, shia and hpma, of serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis, respectively. homology is also observed between the n-termini  of fha, shia and hpma. export of the haemolysins requires the n-termini of these  molecules, and when this region was removed from fha by an in-frame deletion, fha biosynthesis was abolished. these results suggest that the n-terminus of fha interacts with fhac, and that as a result fha is transported across the outer membrane.

(among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == [staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. bacteriologic aspects].
AB  == struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria.  extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. this trial examines the bacteriologic  aspects pre and post-eswl. eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (uti) were submitted to urine  cultures pre and post-eswl. the first 50 patients underwent during and post-eswl, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of  generalized sepsis. no patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. with respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-eswl uti, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a uti post-eswl. the distribution of organisms pre and post-eswl was as follows: proteus mirabilis (22/22), escherichia coli (11/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), enterobacter cloacae (0/1), alcaligenes odorans (1/2) enterococcus faecalis (1/3), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and candida albicans (1/1). in this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-eswl probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. according to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. in 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial  infection.

TI  == the pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration and in-vitro activity of loracarbef, a beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbacephem class.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics of loracarbef in plasma and a mild inflammatory exudate were studied in human volunteers. after a single oral dose of 400 mg, a mean maximum drug concentration (cmax) of 17.8 mg/l was achieved in the plasma at 1.2 h (mean  tmax). the mean plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) was 1.3 h. in the inflammatory exudate the mean cmax was 8.9 mg/l at a mean tmax of 2.0 h and with  a mean t1/2 of 1.7 h. the mean penetration into the inflammatory exudate was 90.1%. the in-vitro activity of loracarbef was determined against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90s of 4 mg/l and 1 mg/l respectively, regardless of beta-lactamase production), as well as streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 of 2 mg/l). loracarbef was also active against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic90s of < or = 2 mg/l). the in-vitro activity and pharmacokinetics of loracarbef suggest that it would be efficative therapy for patients with community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections caused by the most frequently-encountered bacterial pathogens.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == the effects of electric current on bacteria colonising intravenous catheters.
AB  == the effect of a direct electric current (10 microa) on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis was investigated. when the ends of negatively-charged intravascular catheters were placed in nutrient agar seeded with bacteria, circular zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were observed around the catheters. the zones ranged from 6 to 16 mm in diameter according to the organism under test. zones of inhibition were not produced around positively-charged catheters. bacteria colonising the surfaces of catheters were  similarly affected by the application of a 10 microa electric current. a negative electric current applied to colonised catheters for 4 to 24 h significantly reduced the number of adherent viable organisms as compared to controls. the results demonstrated that a constant electric current of low amperage might be used to reduce bacterial colonisation of intravascular catheters. this may offer  a novel means of protecting catheters and other prosthetic devices from associated sepsis in vivo.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical gram-positive  and gram-negative isolates. cefepime was active at low concentrations (mic50 values < or = 0.06 mg/l and mic90 values < or = 0.12 mg/l) against non-cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.). for klebsiella pneumoniae, mics were between 0.016 and 16 mg/l; the highest mic values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. against enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing enterobacter cloacae, mics were < or = 0.5 mg/l, but mics against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. ticarcillin-sensitive strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/l, while cefepime mics were 8-64 mg/l for strains resistant to ticarcillin. the cefepime mic50 value for haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/l. against methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus, cefepime mics were 0.5-16 mg/l; mics against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/l). against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime mic values were 0.03-16 mg/l; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains  were 2-128 mg/l. streptococci (groups a, c and g) were sensitive to cefepime with mics ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/l (mic50, 0.03 mg/l; mic90, 0.25 mg/l). the activity of cefepime against group b streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with mic50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively, and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. most enterococci and all listeria monocytogenes strains had mics > or = 32 mg/l.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of the pseudomonas putida protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase genes.
AB  == the genes that encode the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (3,4-pcd [ec 1.13.11.3]) were cloned from a pseudomonas putida (formerly p. aeruginosa) (atcc 23975) genomic library prepared in lambda phage. plaques were screened by hybridization with degenerate oligonucleotides designed  using known amino acid sequences. a 1.5-kb smai fragment from a 15-kb primary clone was subcloned, sequenced, and shown to contain two successive open reading  frames, designated pcah and pcag, corresponding to the beta and alpha subunits, respectively, of 3,4-pcd. the amino acid sequences deduced from pcahg matched the chemically determined sequence of 3,4-pcd in all except three positions. cloning  of pcahg into broad-host-range expression vector pkmy319 allowed high levels of expression in p. putida strains, as well as in proteus mirabilis after specific induction of the plasmid-encoded nahg promoter with salicylate. the recombinant enzyme was purified and crystallized from p. mirabilis, which lacks an endogenous 3,4-pcd. the physical, spectroscopic, and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzyme were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme. moreover, the same transient enzyme intermediates were formed during the catalytic cycle. these studies establish the methodology which will allow mechanistic investigations to  be pursued through site-directed mutagenesis of p. putida 3,4-pcd, the only aromatic ring-cleaving dioxygenase for which the three-dimensional structure is known.

TI  == iontophoresis and chloride-containing compounds: parameters required for killing.
AB  == fungi, and gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were susceptible to iontophoretic killing in simple media. iontophoresis did not depend on electrode  type but did require chloride-containing compounds in the medium. all organisms could be killed efficiently if chloride-containing compounds (for example sodium  chloride and calcium chloride) were present in physiological concentrations. effectiveness of iontophoretic killing could be reduced by nonphysiologically elevated concentrations of other substances (for example creatinine and albumin). the data suggest that iontophoresis should function well in urine, since chloride-containing compounds are present in adequate concentrations even if some naturally occurring compounds, such as creatinine or albumin, are elevated.

AB  == during a multicentre study performed in 26 french hospitals, 287 (3.2%) of 9038 enterobacteriaceae isolated, mainly enterobacter spp., serratia spp., citrobacter spp. and klebsiella spp. were classified as ceftriaxone resistant on the basis of an mic > 4 mg/l or the presence of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was present mainly in klebsiella pneumoniae (65  strains, 10.2%) and very rarely in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. the extended-spectrum  beta-lactamases conferred low-level resistance to ceftriaxone in nearly 60% of the strains harbouring them, emphasizing the need for routine testing for the presence of these enzymes. among transconjugants three types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were identified. those resembling tem-3 were the most common, but  tem-21, and shv-4 were also found. clavulanate and to a lesser extent sulbactam inhibited all the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases encountered in this study.

TI  == the effect of cytokines on bactericidal activity of murine neutrophils.
AB  == a range of recombinant cytokines have now been shown to modify aspects of the phenotype and function of human and murine neutrophils. however, few reports describe modification of the bactericidal activity of neutrophils. we therefore examined the recombinant murine cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha, 10-1000 ng ml-1) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (gm-csf, 10-1000 u ml-1) for their ability to increase the bacterial killing capacity of murine neutrophils. neutrophils from either bone marrow (fresh or cultured), or peritoneal exudates, or abscesses, were pre-incubated with either cytokine for 30-60 min and the killing of proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, or bacteroides  fragilis was examined in the presence or absence of serum over a 90 min period. only for one combination was a small but significantly enhanced level of bacterial killing observed, the phagocytic killing of p. mirabilis by peritoneal  exudate neutrophils in the presence of gm-csf and serum. with this exception there was no enhancement of bacterial killing for the range of combinations of neutrophils and bacterial species tested. in contrast, at the concentrations tested for effect on bactericidal activity, tnf-alpha and gm-csf were able to significantly upregulate cr3 (but not fc gamma rii) expression on mouse neutrophils. these results indicate that upregulation of cr3 as an index of neutrophil activation does not necessarily correlate with increased bactericidal  activity.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase enzyme production in bacteria isolated from women with postpartum endometritis.
AB  == one hundred eighty-four postpartum patients with the diagnosis of endomyometritis underwent intrauterine culturing. beta-lactamase production was tested using nitrocephin-impregnated discs in 278 bacterial isolates from patients with postpartum endometritis. beta-lactamase production was found to be present in 149 of 278 (54%) isolates tested: 0 of 39 streptococcus faecalis (0%), 22 of 41 escherichia coli (54%), 66 of 68 bacteroides bivius (97%), 0 of 13 proteus mirabilis (0%) and 15 of 42 staphylococcus epidermidis (36%). anaerobes, as a group, had the highest rate of beta-lactamase production, 94 of 102 (93%), followed by gram negatives, 34 of 84 (40%), then gram positives, 21 of 91 (23%).  however, it was the beta-lactamase produced by the gram-negative bacteria that was most responsive to the addition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor. the frequent isolation of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from patients with postpartum endometritis raises concern about the use of antibiotics not resistant to these enzymes. therefore, antibiotics combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor may have potential as single-agent therapy in obstetric and gynecologic infections.

AB  == this study examines the pathophysiology of hepatobiliary complications induced by total parenteral nutrition (tpn) by using animal models that underwent cecal ligation to produce intra-abdominal infection and received an enterostomy to mimic a high-output fistula, which causes the interruption of enterohepatic circulation of bile salt. aspartate transaminase was elevated after tpn (p < .05). alkaline phosphatase was increased in animals receiving tpn plus an enterostomy (p < .05). serum albumin was significantly decreased in animals receiving tpn plus undergoing cecal ligation or enterostomy (p < .05). liver weight and liver protein and water content decreased in animals receiving tpn alone (p < .05). liver water content increased in animals receiving tpn plus undergoing cecal ligation (p < .05). liver lipid content increased after tpn and  to a significant degree in rats receiving tpn plus undergoing cecal ligation or enterostomy (p < .05). bile flow diminished after tpn and to a level reaching significance in animals receiving tpn plus undergoing cecal ligation or enterostomy (p < .05). reduction of bile flow, decrease of biliary cholesterol secretion, and increase of biliary bilirubin secretion, which may be the cause of tpn-induced bilirubinate stones, were most significant in animals receiving tpn plus undergoing cecal ligation (p < .05). in conclusion, tpn can induce hepatic dysfunction and bilirubinate stones, but these complications are more common in animals with associated intra-abdominal infection or high-output fistula.

AB  == objective: to review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by medline; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by bristol-myers squibb. study selection: only published comparative clinical trial  reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. noncomparative clinical  data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the food and drug administration are not included. data synthesis: data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. in clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be  at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal  adverse effects. conclusions: cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections,  secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.

TI  == effect of lps on epithelial integrity and bacterial uptake in the polarized human enterocyte-like cell line caco-2.
AB  == bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) has been speculated to facilitate bacterial translocation by a mechanism involving physical disruption of the gut mucosal barrier. polarized, cultured intestinal epithelial cells (caco-2 cells) were used to study the effect of lps on enterocyte structure, viability, and susceptibility to bacterial invasion. varying concentrations of biologically active lps were incubated with enterocytes for 1 and 16 hr. lps had no noticeable effect on enterocyte viability or morphology, as measured by uptake of vital dyes, by distribution of cytoskeletal filamentous actin, and by visualization of subcellular ultrastructure. transepithelial electrical resistance was similar in  enterocyte cultures incubated with lps for 1 hr, but there was a noticeable decrease after 16 hr, indicating a loss of epithelial integrity after prolonged exposure to lps. the effect of lps on bacterial uptake was studied using six strains of enteric bacteria with varying abilities to invade caco-2 cells: listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli (2 strains), and enterococcus faecalis. electron microscopy showed enteric bacteria in intimate association with enterocyte apical microvilli, and internalized bacteria were consistently observed within cytoplasmic, membrane-bound vacuoles. following a 1-hr incubation of individual strains of enteric bacteria with caco-2 cells, numbers of viable intracellular bacteria varied significantly between individual bacterial strains, but numbers of intracellular bacteria were similar for each strain incubated with enterocytes exposed to 0, 10, and 100 micrograms lps for 1 and 16 hr. thus, although prolonged exposure to lps might have some effect on enterocyte culture integrity  (as measured by decreased electrical resistance), lps had no discernible effect on enterocyte structure, viability, and susceptibility to bacterial invasion. these results suggested that lps-induced bacterial translocation might not involve loss of epithelial viability, or facilitated entry of bacteria into intestinal epithelial cells.

TI  == infection and antibiotic therapy in 4000 burned patients treated in milan, italy, between 1976 and 1988.
AB  == the pathogenic flora, isolated from burn wounds of patients admitted to a burn care unit during the years between 1976 and 1988 were typed and the in vitro susceptibility to antibacterial agents was recorded. between 1976 and 1988 the general therapeutic approach was changed three times, in congruence with the prevalent nosocomial bacterial resistance. the most frequent isolates were: pseud. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp. and other enterobacteriaceae, such as acinetobacter, citrobacter. the most striking finding was the increase in antibiotic-resistant enterococcus isolates. staph. aureus, klebsiella and e. cloacae showed susceptibility to cephalosporins, imipenem, pefloxacin, vancomycin; enterococcus susceptibility to pefloxacin and vancomycin, and pseud. aeruginosa sensitivity to piperacillin, amikacin, tobramycin was generally good. e. coli showed a satisfactory susceptibility on average, and p. mirabilis showed a good sensitivity to piperacillin, cephalosporins, amikacin, tobramycin, aztreonam and imipenem. thus, the general bacterial flora and susceptibility have remained mostly unchanged over the years, with the conspicuous exception of enterococcus spp. and e. cloacae, which demonstrated a marked increase in incidence, with a concomitant dramatic decrease in the sensitivity of enterococcus spp. to antibiotics.

TI  == multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
AB  == twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam.  high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic  tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst  the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and  co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.

TI  == [histamine release from mast cell induced by main pathogenic bacteria of respiratory infections in guangzhou area].
AB  == the methodology for isolating rat peritoneal mast cell was established. the main  pathogenic bacterial ultrasonicates of respiratory infection in guangzhou area have been examined for their ability to release histamine from purified rat peritoneal mast cells. the results were as following: (1) 7 pathogenic bacteria can cause direct release of histamine from rat mast cells. the most effective histamine releasers were p. mira (histamine release percent is 26.89% +/- 6.70%), strep. pneu (24.16% +/- 3.71%), e. coli (20.40% +/- 4.83%) and k. pneu (17.91% +/- 4.60%). (2) histamine release initiated by bacterial ultrasonicates was completed within 30 minutes e. coli differed from k. pneu induced histamine release was independent of its dose. (3) the products of k. pneu did not induce histamine release directly and bacterial hemolysin may play a potent role in bacteria-induced release of histamine. our findings provide some evidence for mechanism by which respiratory bacterial infection can precipitate or exacerbate  attacks of bronchial asthma.

TI  == cloning, expression and sequencing of helicobacter felis urease genes.
AB  == urease genes from helicobacter felis were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli cells. a genomic bank of sau3a-digested h. felis chromosomal dna was created using a cosmid vector. cosmid clones were screened for urease activity following  subculture on a nitrogen-limiting medium. subcloning of dna from an urease-positive cosmid clone led to the construction of pill205 (9.5 kb) which conferred a urease activity of 1.2 +/- 0.5 mumole urea min-1 mg-1 bacterial protein to e. coli hb101 bacteria grown on a nitrogen-limiting medium. random mutagenesis using a minitn3-km transposable element permitted the identification  of three dna regions on pill205 which were necessary for the expression of an urease-positive phenotype in e. coli clones. to localize the putative structural  genes of h. felis on pill205, extracts of clones harbouring the mutated copies of the plasmid were analysed by western blotting with anti-h. felis rabbit serum. one mutant clone did not synthesize the putative ureb subunit of h. felis urease  and it was postulated that the transposable element had disrupted the corresponding structural gene. by sequencing the dna region adjacent to the transposon insertion site two open reading frames, designated urea and ureb, were identified. the polypeptides encoded by these genes had calculated molecular masses of 26,074 and 61,663 da, respectively, and shared 73.5% and 88.2% identity with the corresponding gene products of helicobacter pylori urease.

TI  == genotoxicity studies in semiconductor industry. 1. in vitro mutagenicity and genotoxicity studies of waste samples resulting from plasma etching.
AB  == solid waste samples taken from the etching reactor, the turbo pump, and the waste air system of a plasma etching technology line in semiconductor production were studied as to their genotoxic properties in a bacterial repair test, in the ames/salmonella microsome assay, in the sos chromotest, in primary mouse hepatocytes, and in chinese hamster v79 cell cultures. all three waste samples were found to be active by inducing of unscheduled dna-synthesis in mouse hepatocytes in vitro. in the bacterial rec-type repair test with proteus mirabilis, waste samples taken from the turbo pump and the vacuum pipe system were not genotoxic. the waste sample taken from the chlorine-mediated plasma reactor was clearly positive in the bacterial repair assay and in the sos chromotest wit escherichia coli. mutagenic activity was demonstrated for all samples in the presence and absence of s9 mix made from mouse liver homogenate. again, highest mutagenic activity was recorded for the waste sample taken from the plasma reactor, while samples collected from the turbo pump and from the waste air system before dilution and liberation of the air were less mutagenic. for all samples chromosomal damage in v79 cells was not detected, indicating absence of clastogenic activity in vitro. altogether, these results indicate generation of genotoxic and mutagenic products as a consequence of chlorine-mediated plasma etching in the microelectronics industry and the presence of genotoxins even in places distant from the plasma reactor. occupational exposure can be expected both from the precipitated wastes and from  chemicals reaching the environment with the air stream.

TI  == proteus mirabilis urease: histidine 320 of urec is essential for urea hydrolysis  and nickel ion binding within the native enzyme.
AB  == proteus mirabilis urease, a nickel-containing enzyme, has been established as a critical virulence determinant in urinary tract infection. an amino acid sequence (residues 308 to 327: tvdehldmlmvchhldpsip) within the large urease subunit, urec, is highly conserved for every urease examined thus far and has been suggested to reside within the enzyme active site. histidine residues have been postulated to play a role in catalysis by coordinating ni2+ ions. to test this hypothesis, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to change amino acid his-320 to leu-320 within urec. the base change (cat for his-320 to ctt for leu-320) was confirmed by dna sequencing. the recombinant and mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels in escherichia coli as detected by western blotting (immunoblotting) of denaturing and nondenaturing gels. specific activities of the enzymes were quantitated after partial purification. strains expressing the mutant enzyme showed no detectable activity, whereas strains expressing the recombinant enzyme hydrolyzed urea at 149 mumol of nh3 per min per mg of protein. in addition, the mutant enzyme was able to incorporate only about  one-half (58%) of the amount of 63ni2+ incorporated by the active recombinant enzyme. while the mutation of his-320 to leu-320 within urec does not affect expression or assembly of urease polypeptide subunits urea, ureb, and urec his-320 of urec is required for urea hydrolysis and proper incorporation of ni2+  into apoenzyme.

TI  == continuing the search for bacterial urovirulence factors.
AB  == bacteria that commonly cause infections of the normal urinary tract (eg escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus saprophyticus) do so because they possess specific urovirulence factors. adhesions of various types (often fimbriae) seem to be the most important of these. in e. coli several other factors have been recognized, and sub-sets of defined uropathogenic clones exist. on the other hand, urovirulence determinants are less easy to distinguish in species such as s. epidermidis and klebsiella pneumoniae, that rarely cause such  infections, or are pathogenic only in the presence of some abnormality or deficiency in host defences.

TI  == loracarbef. a review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy.
AB  == loracarbef is an orally administered member of a new synthetic class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbacephems, which is characterised by enhanced chemical stability. at low concentrations (< 2 mg/l) in vitro, it inhibits streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococci groups b, c and g. proteus mirabilis and moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. at therapeutic plasma concentrations it is also active in vitro against most strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus,  escherichia coli and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of haemophilus influenzae. like other beta-lactams, loracarbef is inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. when administered at dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of loracarbef is comparable with that of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and comparable with that of cefaclor in treating infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures and urinary tract. loracarbef and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v) were equally effective in treating streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis.  loracarbef is generally well tolerated by all age groups and causes less diarrhoea than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. it is administered twice daily. it offers a suitable alternative to other orally administered antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible organisms.

AB  == magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, er, was evaluated. the magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. the optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mm nacl and 5 mm ercl(3) solution. three gram-positive bacteria,  staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. qualitative analysis consisted of gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. the  magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of e. coli down to the concentration of 10 cfu ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. on average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms  was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. the thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.

AB  == severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice are valuable animals to study a variety of physiologic and disease processes. their capacity to support multiple  tissue xenografts permits these mice to be used as intermediate models for host-specific, fastidious organisms for which a small animal model has not been available previously. however, because they are unable to mount a normal immune response, they are very susceptible to a variety of primary and opportunistic microbial pathogens. fatal, naturally occurring infections with bacteria such as  proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans, and escherichia coli have been observed. in addition, based on observations after experimental or naturally occurring viral infections, scid and scid/beige mice have been shown to be very susceptible to infections with viruses such as mouse hepatitis virus, sendai virus, and murine respiratory virus, with resulting mortality. of the parasitic infections, pneumocystis carinii is a relatively common contaminant of the respiratory tracts of scid mice and may complicate research projects, particularly experimental respiratory tract infections. in view of the enhanced susceptibility of these mice to infections of this type, it is essential that they be housed under optimal conditions, which include implementing stringent management practices and a functional barrier system.

TI  == serum and urinary cefpodoxime levels and time killing curves performed in the urine of children presenting urinary tract infections.
AB  == since resistance to several oral antimicrobials useful for the treatment of pediatric urinary tract infections (uti) is overwhelming in argentina, an in vitro investigation was performed testing 400 isolates obtained from urines of children suffering uti's, 200 collected in 1990 and 200 in 1991. their susceptibility against oral antimicrobials marketed in argentina and appropriate  for the treatment of uti was determined by the agar dilution methods. an increase of the resistance to aminopenicillin combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors and  to fluoroquinolones was observed comparing the two periods. cefpodoxime (cpd), cefixime and fluoroquinolones except norfloxacin were the sole oral antimicrobials showing in vitro activity at the 90 per cent level. unfortunately  fluoroquinolones are not yet approved for pediatric use. consequently we realized an in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic study in order to determine cpd activity  against e. coli isolated in uti cases. five children (6-10 y) showing e. coli uti infections received 10 mg/kg/d cpd in a single oral daily dose and were treated up to 10 days, 3 had lower uti and 2 upper uti. all patients were clinical and bacteriologically cured. cultures obtained up to 4 weeks after treatment were negative. cpd serum levels at 2 hours after the first dose of treatment showed a  median of 2.7 mg/l (2.3-3.4 range). bactericidal serum titers at the same time against the patients own strain and an e. coli tem-1 hyperproducer strain (mic 4,096 mg/l for ampicillin and 0.5 mg/l for cpd) showed a median value of 1/8 against patients strains and 1/2 against the thp strain.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == efficacy of fleroxacin versus amoxicillin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == in a multicenter study the efficacy and safety of oral fleroxacin at 400 mg once  a day and amoxicillin at 500 mg three times daily for 7 days were compared for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to drug-susceptible bacteria. a total of 194 patients were enrolled, 102 in the fleroxacin group and 92 in the amoxicillin group. of those enrolled, 22 in the fleroxacin group and 30 (29 for clinical efficacy) in the amoxicillin group were included in the efficacy analysis. all were included in the safety analysis. clinical success was noted in 21 (95%) of 22 fleroxacin-treated patients and 22 (76%) of 29 amoxicillin-treated patients. bacteriologic cure was obtained in 21 (95%) of 22 of the fleroxacin group and 18  (60%) of 30 of the amoxicillin group. one haemophilus parainfluenzae strain persisted with fleroxacin. persisting organisms with amoxicillin included haemophilus influenzae (four), haemophilus parainfluenzae (three), escherichia coli (two), streptococcus pneumoniae (one), neisseria species (one), and proteus  mirabilis (one). adverse events were reported by 41% of 102 patients receiving fleroxacin and 15% of 92 patients receiving amoxicillin. insomnia, dizziness, and nausea occurred more frequently with fleroxacin. fleroxacin may be indicated for  the treatment of acute bacterial infection in chronic bronchitis known to be due  to haemophilus species and moraxella catarrhalis. the 92% incidence of resistance among the s. pneumoniae isolates recovered from all enrolled patients suggests that fleroxacin may not be useful for such infections.

TI  == a sequential study of intravenous and oral fleroxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection.
AB  == this study enrolled patients with complicated urinary tract infections (utis) in  a trial to determine the efficacy and safety of sequential therapy with intravenous fleroxacin (first 3 days) followed by oral fleroxacin, for a total course of 7-14 days, both administered at a dosage of 400 mg once a day. we enrolled 68 patients with complicated utis or acute pyelonephritis, 32 of whom were evaluable for bacteriologic and clinical efficacy. the pathogens isolated included escherichia coli, 15; enterococci, 9; miscellaneous, 15. intravenous fleroxacin was given for a mean of 3.2 days, followed by oral fleroxacin for a mean of 5.3 days. a total of 27 patients were clinically cured (84%), two improved, and three failed. a total of 26 patients were bacteriologically cured (81%), and six failed (19%). the bacteria that were not eradicated included enterococci, 4; staphylococcus epidermidis, 1; and pseudomonas species, 1. one enterococcal isolate became resistant to fleroxacin. four patients were bacteremic (e. coli, 3; proteus mirabilis, 1); the pathogen was eradicated in all cases. two patients developed urinary enterococcal superinfections. a total of 12 patients experienced 16 adverse reactions remotely, possibly, or probably related to fleroxacin (insomnia, 3; dizziness, 2; miscellaneous, 11). one patient had a grand mal seizure after aspirating gastric contents; the seizure was thought to be only remotely related to the study drug. fleroxacin was discontinued in two patients because of adverse effects (phlebitis at intravenous access site, 1; anxiety and insomnia, 1). only minor and asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities were observed. all clinical and laboratory abnormalities resolved with discontinuation of the study drug. fleroxacin is a safe and effective antibiotic  for sequential intravenous and oral treatment of acute pyelonephritis and complicated utis. enterococci may be problematic pathogens, as reported with other fluoroquinolones.

AB  == immunological characterization of various pseudomonas pseudomallei preparations was carried out by sds-page and western blot using sera from infected humans and  from patients with other bacterial infections. somatic (som) and partially purified cell extracts (pce) gave more complex sds-page patterns: m(r) ranged from 86 to 12.7 and 48 to 10 kda, respectively. the culture-filtrated antigens (cf) from 3 different kinds of synthetic media consisted of fairly simple profiles with common bands m(r) of 40, 26 and 16 kda. pce and cf reacted specifically with infected human sera; som did not. the components with m(r) of 40 kda in cf reacted consistently with all infected sera but failed to react with sera infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. stutzeri. this peptide was demonstrated to be a major component in cf thus suggesting its potential for development of immunodiagnostic methods for melioidosis.

TI  == outer membrane permeability barrier to azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin in gram-negative enteric bacteria.
AB  == mutations which severely affect the function of the outer membrane of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium (lpxa and fira mutations of lipid a synthesis and rfae mutation of the lipopolysaccharide inner-core synthesis) were found to decrease the mics of erythromycin, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin by factors of 32 to 512, 32 to 1,024, 64 to 512, and 16 to 64, respectively. the sensitization factors for three other hydrophobic antibiotics (rifampin, fusidic acid, and mupirocin) ranged from 16 to 300. the outer membrane permeability-increasing agents polymyxin b nonapeptide (3 micrograms/ml) and deacylpolymyxin b (1 microgram/ml) sensitized wild-type e. coli to azithromycin by factors of 10 and 30, respectively. quantitatively very similar sensitization  to the other macrolides took place. polymyxin-resistant pmra mutants of s. typhimurium displayed no cross-resistance to azithromycin. proteus mirabilis mutants which were sensitized to polymyxin by a factor of > or = 300 to > or = 1,000 had a maximal two- to fourfold increase in sensitivity to azithromycin. these results indicate that azithromycin and the other new macrolides use the hydrophobic pathway across the outer membrane and that the intact outer membrane  is an effective barrier against them. furthermore, the results indicate that azithromycin, in contrast to polymyxin, does not effectively diffuse through the  outer membrane by interacting electrostatically with the lipopolysaccharide.

AB  == proteus mirabilis, a cause of serious urinary tract infection and acute pyelonephritis, produces several putative virulence determinants, among them, fimbriae. principally, two fimbrial types are produced by this species: mannose-resistant/proteus-like (mr/p) fimbriae and mannose-resistant/klebsiella-like (mr/k) fimbriae. to isolate mr/p fimbrial gene  sequences, a p. mirabilis cosmid library was screened by immunoblotting and by hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe based on the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the isolated fimbrial polypeptide, adqghgtvkfvgsiidapcs. one clone, pmrp101, reacted strongly with a monoclonal antibody specific for mr/p fimbriae and with the dna probe. this clone hemagglutinated both tannic acid-treated and untreated chicken erythrocytes with or without 50 mm d-mannose and was shown to be fimbriated by transmission electron microscopy. a 525-bp open reading frame, designated mrpa, predicted a 175-amino-acid polypeptide including a 23-amino-acid hydrophobic leader peptide. the unprocessed and processed polypeptides are predicted to be 17,909 and 15,689 da, respectively. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the processed fimbrial subunit exactly matched amino acid residues 24 to 43 predicted by the mrpa nucleotide sequence. the mrpa polypeptide shares 57%  amino acid sequence identity with smfa, the major fimbrial subunit of serratia marcescens mannose-resistant fimbriae.

TI  == proteus mirabilis urease: transcriptional regulation by urer.
AB  == proteus mirabilis urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea, initiating the formation of urinary stones. the enzyme is critical for kidney colonization and the development of acute pyelonephritis. urease is induced by urea and is not controlled by the nitrogen regulatory system (ntr) or catabolite repression. purified whole-cell rna from induced and uninduced cultures of p. mirabilis and escherichia coli harboring cloned urease sequences was probed with a 4.2-kb bgli  fragment from within the urease operon. autoradiographs of slot blots demonstrated 4.2- and 5.8-fold increases, respectively, in urease-specific rna upon induction with urea. structural and accessory genes necessary for urease activity, ured, a, b, c, e, and f, were previously cloned and sequenced (b. d. jones and h. l. t. mobley, j. bacteriol. 171:6414-6422, 1989). a 1.2-kb ecorv-bamhi restriction fragment upstream of these sequences confers inducibility upon the operon in trans. nucleotide sequencing of this fragment revealed a single open reading frame of 882 nucleotides, designated urer, which is transcribed in the direction opposite that of the urease structural and accessory genes and encodes a 293-amino-acid polypeptide predicted to be 33,415 da in size. autoradiographs of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of [35s]methionine-labeled polypeptides obtained by in vitro transcription-translation of the pcr fragments carrying only urer yielded a single band with an apparent molecular size of 32 kda. fragments carrying an in-frame deletion within urer synthesized a truncated product. the predicted urer amino acid sequence contains a potential helix-turn-helix motif and an associated arac family signature and is similar to that predicted for a number of dna-binding proteins, including e. coli proteins that regulate acid phosphatase synthesis (appy), porin synthesis (envy), and rhamnose utilization (rhar). these  data suggest that urer governs the inducibility of p. mirabilis urease.

AB  == adherence of bacteria to the intestinal epithelial cell may be the crucial initiating event for invasion and translocation and is normally prevented by both immune (iga) and nonimmune (mucus, peristalsis, desquamation) mucosal defense mechanisms. the purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of endotoxin administration on mucosal immunity and to define the role of glucocorticoids, commonly released during endotoxicosis, in this process. thirty  female fisher rats were randomly assigned to three groups of 10 animals each. group i (cont), was fed rat chow and h2o ad lib., group ii (dex) was administered 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously of dexamethasone, and group iii (etx) was given 1 mg/kg  of endotoxin. twenty-four hours later animals were sacrificed and mesenteric lymph nodes and vigorously washed stool-free ceca were collected and cultured. bile was collected and assayed for iga from 5 animals in each group. a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in secretory iga was noted in animals treated with either dexamethasone or endotoxin (cont = 332 +/- 42, dex = 78 +/- 24, etx = 68 +/- 16 micrograms/mg protein +/- sem). no difference in s-iga between animals  in the dexamethasone-treated group and the endotoxin-treated group was noted (p = ns). a statistically significant increase (p < 0.001) in bacteria adherent to the cecal wall in both the dexamethasone-treated rats and the endotoxin-treated rats  over that in = 7.5 +/- 0.8, cont = 6.4 +/- 0.6 cfu/g(log10) +/- sd). our results  suggest that endotoxin or glucocorticoid administration results in significant bacterial adherence to the cecal mucosa and a decrease in iga.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == thirty ureteral stents, inserted for 5 to 128 days following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, were examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms. of these, 90% had adherent pathogens (44% mixed organisms) on the stents, 45% of which were present in low numbers (10(1)-10(2) per 1 cm3 section) and 55% were in small and  large microcolony biofilms (> 2 x 10(2)-10(7)). the organisms were recovered from the stents even though urine culture was only positive in 27% of patients. of the organisms isolated, 77% were gram positive cocci, 15% gram negative rods and 8% candida. no blockage of the stents occurred. all of the patients had received antimicrobial therapy post-insertion, and in 15 cases biofilms were found while on treatment. none of the patients received therapy for urinary tract infections  while the stent remained in place. in vitro experiments demonstrated the ability  of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis uropathogens to adhere and form biofilms on ureteral stents within 24 hours. clearly, bacterial biofilms do occur on ureteral stents and urinary culture may not detect their presence. the high recovery rate of gram positive organisms may indicate a preferential adhesion to the biomaterial surface. the findings also indicate that unlike biofilm formation on many other prosthetic implants, colonization with gram positive organisms on ureteral stents does not necessarily coincide with the development symptomatic infection.

TI  == survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the royal london hospital.
AB  == beta-lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the microbiology laboratory of the royal london hospital. this survey, performed between january and april, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. the distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. this increase was balanced by a decreased proportion  of enterobacteria. amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, tem-1 (especially),  tem-2, shv-1 and oxa types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. their frequency in escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst proteus mirabilis isolates. an apparent decrease in their frequency amongst enterobacter cloacae isolates, from  48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of p. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. in the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of e. cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii, and in 2/170 p. aeruginosa isolates. these proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (p approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were  found in 11/70 klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced tem-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified shv-derived enzyme.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of tosufloxacin against and uptake of tosufloxacin by outer membrane mutants of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of tosufloxacin and other quinolones against and apparent uptakes of tosufloxacin and other quinolones by outer membrane mutants of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella typhimurium were studied.  the hydrophobicity of tosufloxacin was nearly equal to that of ofloxacin or lower than those of sparfloxacin and nalidixic acid. ompf- and ompc-deficient e. coli and 40-kda porin-deficient p. mirabilis mutants were twofold more susceptible to  tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin but two- to fourfold less susceptible to other quinolones than their parent strains. in s. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide-deficient (rough) mutants, the differences in susceptibility to tosufloxacin were similar to those to sparfloxacin and nalidixic acid. the apparent uptake of tosufloxacin by intact cells was increased in porin-deficient  mutants compared with that by their parent strain. these results suggest that the permeation route of tosufloxacin across the outer membrane is different from that of other fluoroquinolones and that tosufloxacin may permeate mainly through the nonporin pathway, presumably phospholipid bilayers. however, this characteristic  is independent of the hydrophobicity of the molecule.

TI  == production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody to the o-acetylated peptidoglycan of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == a monoclonal antibody (pmpg5-3) specific for the o-acetylated peptidoglycan of proteus mirabilis 19 was produced by an ns-1 myeloma cell line and purified from  ascites fluid by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity chromatography. the monoclonal antibody (an immunoglobulin m) was characterized by a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to be equally specific for both insoluble and soluble o-acetylated peptidoglycan but weakly recognized chemically de-o-acetylated p. mirabilis peptidoglycan, the non-o-acetylated peptidoglycans from escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, and the peptidoglycan monosaccharide precursors n-acetylglucosamine and n-acetylmuramic acid dipeptide. the monoclonal antibody did not react with d-alanine or lipopolysaccharide isolated from p. mirabilis. based on this evidence, the binding epitope on the p. mirabilis peptidoglycan is predicted to be linear and to comprise the glycan backbone, including both the n- and o-acetyl moieties. monoclonal antibody pmpg5-3 was used to localize the o acetylation of the p. mirabilis peptidoglycan  by immunoelectron microscopy. murein sacculi of p. mirabilis were heavily and randomly labelled with the immunogold, whereas very little labelling and no labelling were observed on the sacculi isolated from de-o-acetylated p. mirabilis and e. coli, respectively. based on the apparent pattern of immunogold labelling, a physiological role for peptidoglycan o acetylation in p. mirabilis is proposed.

TI  == urinary tract infection in acute spinal cord injury.
AB  == preservation of renal function and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections is the ultimate goal of any method of neurogenic bladder management in spinal cord injury patients. method--the hospital courses of fifty such patients  admitted to our rehabilitation department from august 1989 to august 1990 were studied according to age, gender, spinal cord injury level, method of bladder drainage on admission and upon discharge, type of urinary tract infections and results of bladder management were documented. results--forty-five men and ten women were studied. mean age of males was forty and females, forty-two. the commonest cause of injury was road traffic accident followed by accidents at work place. fifty-three percent had cervical cord injuries, thirteen percent thoracolumbar and sixteen percent lumbo sacral injuries. seventy-eight percent had an indwelling foley catheter upon admission. upon discharge eighty-two percent of spinal cord injury patients were able to void with/without tapping and compression. there were a total of one hundred and forty-three urinary tract infections in our study group. all positive urine cultures had greater than or equal to 100,000 cfu/ml. the commonest organisms causing urinary tract infection  were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus  mirabilis. conclusion--for bacteria to produce disease in the urinary tract, they must gain access and colonise the uroepithelium, induce inflammation and tissue damage. the indwelling catheter provides a direct access to the uroepithelium, making bacteriuria and subsequent infection inevitable. impaired voiding and sensation in spinal cord injury patients provides an excellent reservoir for the  multiplication of bacteria, tissue invasion and recurrent urinary tract infection. hence current methods of neurogenic bladder management have to focus on attaining a catheter-free status as soon as possible; relevant antibiotic therapy and careful attention to individual urinary tract problems to reduce morbidity and improve on spinal cord injury patient's future. although spinal cord injury patients are described, the material covered is applicable to any type of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.

TI  == klebsiella aerogenes urease gene cluster: sequence of ured and demonstration that four accessory genes (ured, uree, uref, and ureg) are involved in nickel metallocenter biosynthesis.
AB  == the region located immediately upstream from the klebsiella aerogenes urease structural genes was sequenced and shown to possess an open reading frame capable of encoding a 29.8-kda peptide. deletions were generated in this gene, denoted ured, and in each of the genes (uree, uref, and ureg) located immediately downstream of the three structural genes. transformation of the mutated plasmids  into escherichia coli resulted in high levels of urease expression, but the enzyme was inactive (deletions in ured, uref, or ureg) or only partially active (deletions in uree). ureases were purified from the recombinant cells and shown to be identical to control enzyme when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography  and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; however, in every  case the activity levels correlated to nickel contents as analyzed by atomic absorption analysis. ured, uree, uref, and ureg peptides were tentatively identified by gel electrophoretic comparison of mutant and control cell extracts, by in vivo expression of separately cloned genes, or by in vitro transcription-translation analyses; the assignments were confirmed for uree and ureg by amino-terminal sequencing. the latter peptides (apparent m(r)s, 23,900 and 28,500) were present at high levels comparable to those of the urease subunits, whereas the amounts of uref (apparent m(r), 27,000) and ured (apparent  m(r), 29,300) were greatly reduced, perhaps because of the lack of good ribosome  binding sites in the regions upstream of these open reading frames. these results demonstrate that all four accessory genes are necessary for the functional incorporation of the urease metallocenter.

TI  == purification of recombinant helicobacter pylori urease apoenzyme encoded by urea  and ureb.
AB  == helicobacter pylori, a gram-negative, microaerophilic, spiral-shaped bacterium, is an etiologic agent of human gastritis and peptic ulceration and is highly restricted to the gastric mucosa of humans. urease, synthesized at up to 6% of the soluble cell protein, hydrolyzes urea, thereby releasing ammonia, which may neutralize acid, allowing survival of the bacterium and initial colonization of the gastric mucosa. the urease protein is encoded by two subunit genes, urea and  ureb; however, accessory genes are necessary for enzyme activity. h. pylori urease genes were isolated from a cosmid gene bank and subcloned on a 5.8-kb sau3a partial fragment carrying urecdab, corresponding to four open reading frames described by a. labigne, v. cussac, and p. courcoux (j. bacteriol. 173:1920-1931, 1991). clones were confirmed as ureas gene sequences by polymerase chain reaction amplification. the recombinant enzyme was purified from the soluble protein of french press lysates of escherichia coli dh5 alpha(php402) by  chromatography on deae-sepharose, phenyl-sepharose, mono-q, and superose 6 resins. fractions containing a catalytically inactive apoenzyme were identified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) by using antisera to native urea  (29.5 kda) and ureb (66 kda). purified recombinant urease was indistinguishable from native enzyme on a superose 6 column and on coomassie blue-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. the protein reacted specifically on western  blots (immunoblots) with anti-urea and anti-ureb antibodies and was recognized with an intensity equal to that of the native enzyme in an elisa using human sera. clones containing only urea and ureb also produced an assembled but inactive enzyme. enzyme activity was not restored by in trans complementation with cloned urease accessory gene sequences from proteus mirabilis or morganella  morganii. h. pylori urease genes (urecdab) subcloned into pacyc184 were also not  complemented with any of 1,000 cosmid clones containing h. pylori chromosomal sequences. however, larger clones containing 4.5 kb of dna downstream of ureb synthesized catalytically active urease when grown in minimal medium. these data  indicate that the urea and ureb genes encoding h. pylori urease are transcribed and translated in e. coli and that these genes alone are sufficient for the synthesis and assembly of the native size enzyme. genes downstream of ureb, however, are necessary for production of a catalytically active urease.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

AB  == the effect of three cephalosporins (cefetamet, cefaclor and ro 40-6890) upon human granulocytes and their ability to modulate the chemiluminescence response,  phagocytose, kill bacteria and generate leukotrienes was studied. in the presence of the cephalosporins there was a significant increase in phagocytosis of escherichia coli. the bactericidal activity of human granulocytes for several other bacteria was also enhanced. cefetamet and cefaclor increased the chemiluminescence response of human neutrophils to pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis in contrast to ro 40-68790, which decreased the chemiluminescence response. the cephalosporins decreased the synthesis of leukotrienes from human neutrophils after stimulation with escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. these data emphasize the immunomodulatory functions of various cephalosporins on cells involved in host defence.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ru29246, the active metabolite of hr916b.
AB  == hr 916b is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. in tests its active metabolite, ru29246, inhibited streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. it was also more active (mic 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. ru29246 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii and salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor,  but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. it did not inhibit pseudomonas  aeruginosa and other pseudomonas spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens or  bacteroides fragilis. ru29246 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, staphylococcus aureus  tem-2 or moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of proteus vulgaris and morganella morganii. plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by ru29246.

TI  == in vitro activity of loracarbef and effects of susceptibility test methods.
AB  == loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. a review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values (microgram/ml) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; m. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; h. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; escherichia coli, 2.0-25; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; s. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. the in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the results of in vitro susceptibility tests with  any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. this is particularly true with h. influenzae. furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.

TI  == potential for local and systemic bacterial infection in some occupational groups  in benin city, nigeria.
AB  == background: many third world countries may not have adequate facilities for rapid sensitivity testing of antibiotics as an aid to diagnosis and chemotherapy. it may therefore be valuable to relate bacterial carriage on the skin to type of work a person does. methods: given areas of skin in workers from 10 occupational  groups were sampled. the bacteria obtained were analyzed after growth on appropriate media. the sensitivity profiles of potential pathogens isolated from  these groups, as well as of those (staphylococcus aureus only) isolated from patients with certified infections, were carried out and the results were analyzed. results: staphylococcus aureus constituted the most widely and frequently isolated potential pathogen. proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and  klebsiella species were also frequent colonizers of skin. there was a statistical relationship between work type and overall prevalence of bacteria on skin (p less than 0.01). most isolates of the work groups were highly sensitive to gentamicin  and cefuroxine but not to penicillin g, ampicillin, and trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole; isolates from infected persons were generally more resistant than were the community-acquired ones. conclusions: a relationship may exist between the types of bacteria carried on the skin and the type of work in which a person is engaged.

TI  == review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as  streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes;  it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the  activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally  similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

TI  == intestinal bacterial flora, intestinal pathology, and lipopolysaccharide-induced  translocation of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the primary aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism and significance of lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced translocation of intestinal bacteria. female swiss webster mice were purchased from two different animal suppliers. twenty-four hours following parenteral lps, mice from both suppliers had noticeable morbidity and mortality. however, intestinal pathology, gram-negative  bacterial overgrowth, and increased bacterial translocation was noted in mice purchased from one supplier but not the other. mice with increased translocation  also had overgrowth of cecal gram-negative bacilli, i.e., 10(10) per gram of cecum following parenteral lps; in contrast, mice without lps-induced bacterial translocation had 1,000- to 10,000-fold fewer cecal gram-negative bacilli. additional groups of mice with increased bacterial translocation were also sacrificed two and 6 hr after parenteral lps; morbidity and intestinal pathology  were evident without a corresponding increase in bacterial translocation. separate groups of these mice were also injected with platelet activating factor, resulting in intestinal pathology similar to that noted with parenteral lps, but  no increase in bacterial translocation. thus parenteral lps was consistently associated with morbidity and mortality but not with intestinal pathology, enteric bacterial overgrowth, or increased bacterial translocation.

AB  == a multicenter randomized study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of ofloxacin with that of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx) in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in adults. patients were randomized to receive either oral ofloxacin 200 mg daily for three days (102 patients), or oral tmp/smx 160 mg/800 mg twice daily for seven days (100 patients). the pathogen was eradicated in 73 (97.3%) of the 75 evaluable patients receiving ofloxacin and in 66 (97.1%) of the 68 evaluable patients receiving tmp/smx. the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. more urinary pathogens were susceptible to ofloxacin than to tmp/smx, although this difference was not statistically significant. the clinical cure rate for patients receiving ofloxacin was 93.3%, with 4% improved and 2.7% failed. for patients receiving tmp/smx, the clinical cure rate was 86.4%, with 12.1% improved and 1.5% failed. side effects were reported by 29.7% of the patients receiving ofloxacin and by 40.4% of the patients receiving tmp/smx. drug-related adverse experiences, as determined by the investigators, occurred in 5% of the ofloxacin patients and in 15.2% of the tmp/smx patients, a statistically significant difference. no patients receiving ofloxacin, compared with three patients receiving tmp/smx, discontinued therapy because of an adverse reaction. these results indicate that short-course ofloxacin is as effective as tmp/smx in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection. ofloxacin therapy is also better tolerated than tmp/smx.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or  equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter  cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than  16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but  it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.

AB  == techniques currently available to detect shiga-like toxin (slt)-producing escherichia coli lack sensitivity or require specialised equipment and facilities, and in some cases detect only strains belonging to serotype o157. we  have used an elisa technique, capable of detecting both slti and sltii with crude p1 glycoprotein from hydatid cysts, in combination with enhancement of toxin production by culture with mitomycin c. supernates of tryptone soya broth cultures containing mitomycin c 200 ng/ml were tested for sltii. for slti, cell lysates pre-treated with polymyxin b were tested. in tests with e. coli o157:h7 in mixed culture with e. coli strain c600 alone, or with e. coli c600, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis, slti could be detected when the proportion of toxigenic organisms represented 1% of the mixture, and sltii when the proportion was 0.025%. when faecal samples with added e. coli o157:h7 were examined in this system, sltii-producing strains were detected when they comprised less than 0.1% of the coliform population. this technique is a sensitive and specific assay for detecting low numbers of slt-producing organisms in mixed culture such as occurs in cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome and haemorrhagic colitis.

TI  == modulation of effects of lipopolysaccharide on macrophages by a major outer membrane protein of proteus mirabilis as measured in a chemiluminescence assay.
AB  == our previous studies have shown that a major protein isolated from purified cell  walls of proteus mirabilis (39-kda protein) is a strong modulator of the specific immune responses to lipopolysaccharide (lps) from this bacterium. when the protein is mixed with lps before immunization of mice, the responses of antibody-producing cells specific for lps are greatly enhanced and converted predominantly to the immunoglobulin g isotype. in the present study, the immunomodulating effects of the 39-kda protein were tested at the level of interaction of lps with macrophages. activation of macrophages was determined by  measuring the production of oxygen radicals in a chemiluminescence assay with lucigenin as the amplifier. lps from p. mirabilis induced strong oxidative metabolism in both peritoneal and bone marrow-derived murine macrophages. these responses were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by mixing lps with increasing amounts of the protein. in contrast, bovine serum albumin and methylated bovine serum albumin enhanced the response of macrophages dramatically when complexed with lps. the inhibiting activity of the 39-kda protein was also observed with lps from escherichia coli k-12.

AB  == bacterial cell walls and their structural units, particularly peptidoglycan, induce a vast variety of biological effects in host organisms. the pathobiological effects of peptidoglycan are greatly enhanced by various modifications and substitutions to its basic composition and structure. one such  modification is the presence of acetyl moieties at the c-6 hydroxyl group of n-acetylmuramyl residues, and to date, 11 species of eubacteria, including some important human pathogens, such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus mirabilis, and  staphylococcus aureus, are known to possess o-acetylated peptidoglycan. this review addresses the influence of o-acetylation of peptidoglycan on its resistance to degradation both in vitro and in vivo, the clinical importance of the modification, and the currently held views on the pathway for its biosynthesis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the investigational oral and parenteral cephalosporin bk-218.
AB  == bk-218 is a novel cephalosporin with a dual route of administration and spectrum  of activity most similar to that of second-generation cephalosporins. bk-218 was  active against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but strains resistant to penicillins had higher mics. bk-218 had greater activity (8-fold) than cefuroxime or cefaclor against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp. moderate bk-218 activity was observed against neisseria gonorrhoeae and commonly isolated enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli (mic90, 1 mg/l), klebsiella spp. (mic90, 2 mg/l), and proteus mirabilis (mic90, 2 mg/l). the following organisms were generally bk-218-resistant (mic90, greater than 16 mg/l): bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., xanthomonas maltophilia, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., indole-positive proteus, serratia spp., enterococci and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.

TI  == comparison of three-day temafloxacin with seven-day ciprofloxacin treatment of urinary tract infections in women.
AB  == background: temafloxacin is a new broad-spectrum arylfluoroquinolone antimicrobial with an extended serum half-life. methods: in this large, multicenter, double-blind clinical trial, 404 women with acute, uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uti) were randomized to receive temafloxacin 400 mg once daily for 3 days, or ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily for 7 days. clinical and microbiologic evaluations were repeated at 4 to 5 days after initiation of treatment, at the end of therapy, and at 5 to 9 days posttreatment. one hundred fifteen patients who received temafloxacin and 105 patients who received ciprofloxacin met the eligibility criteria for efficacy evaluation. the predominant urinary pathogens were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. no pretherapy isolate was resistant to either study drug. results: bacteriologic eradication was observed in 112 (97%) of 115 women treated with temafloxacin and 101 (96%) of 105 women treated with ciprofloxacin. clinical cure rates at 5 to 9 days posttreatment were 90% (the remaining 10% improved) with temafloxacin and 95% (the remaining 5% improved) with ciprofloxacin. adverse effects associated with treatment occurred in 24 (12%) women who received temafloxacin and 31 (15%) women who received ciprofloxacin. headache (2% with temafloxacin and 2% with ciprofloxacin), nausea  (3% with temafloxacin and 6% with ciprofloxacin), and somnolence (4% with temafloxacin and 3% with ciprofloxacin) were reported most often. only three and  five patients who were treated with temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively, discontinued treatment because of adverse effects. conclusions: in this study, a  3-day treatment regimen using a single daily 400-mg dose of temafloxacin was found to be as effective as a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin in women with acute uncomplicated uti.

TI  == recombination and uv resistance of escherichia coli with the cloned reca and recbcd genes of serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis: evidence for an advantage of intraspecies combination of p. mirabilis reca protein and recbcd enzyme.
AB  == in escherichia coli, constituents of the main recombination pathway are provided  by the genes reca (reca protein) and recbcd (recbcd enzyme). recombination in conjugation experiments and repair of uv damage of e. coli mutants deleted for reca, for recbcd or for reca plus recbcd were restored, although to different degrees, by the cloned reca and recbcd genes from serratia marcescens or proteus  mirabilis. when both recombination enzymes were from the same species, repair and recombination efficiencies had the order e. coli greater than s. marcescens greater than p. mirabilis. however, the p. mirabilis reca plus recbcd genes resulted in higher levels of repair and recombination than those obtained with one component from p. mirabilis (reca or recbcd) and the other from e. coli or s. marcescens. the data provide evidence for the similarity of recabcd pathways of recombination among enteric bacteria and suggest an in vivo advantage of an intraspecies combination of p. mirabilis reca protein and recbcd enzyme over interspecies combinations. this could point to a cooperation between these basic  recombination enzymes. the molecular processes which could be involved are discussed.

TI  == purification and characterization of a tryptic peptide of borrelia burgdorferi flagellin, which reduces cross-reactivity in immunoblots and elisa.
AB  == in man the early immune response in lyme disease is primarily directed against the endoflagellin antigen. isolated flagellar protein of borrelia burgdorferi suggests itself as a suitable test antigen. however, cross-reactivity between flagellins of b. burgdorferi, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, proteus mirabilis and salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated by immunoblotting and elisa with polyclonal rabbit-hyperimmune-sera. tryptic cleavage of recombinant b. burgdorferi 41 kda flagellin, expressed in e. coli, produced a peptide fragment which was recognized exclusively by antisera to borrelia species. this peptide was designated as the 14 kda fragment due to its migratory behaviour in sds-page. the fragment is part of the variable region of the flagellin, as proven by amino  acid sequencing. the flagellin peptide was employed as an antigen in elisa and immunoblot assays, testing the polyclonal sera mentioned above. the specificity was superior to that obtained with the intact recombinant flagellin.

AB  == extracted phospholipids of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae were examined by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry which yielded major peaks between m/z 225 and 761. the result of extracting freeze-dried or 'wet' cells showed that freeze-drying may be omitted although weighing of dried cells offers a useful means of standardizing the extraction procedure. anaerobic  growth quantitatively altered the chemical finger-print as a result of increase in ratio of saturated: unsaturated carboxylic acids. growth temperature also affected profiles over the temperature range 24-45 degrees c. a less drastic influence on mass spectra was culture age, over the range 16-48 h. comparison of  spectra was possible with pearson's coefficient of linear correlation which yielded the following values: wet and lyophilized cells, r = 0.97; aerobic and anaerobic growth, r = 0.82; 24 degrees c and 45 degrees c, r = 0.76; 16 h and 48  h, r = 0.95. these results show that although quantitative differences do occur between spectra for the same organism prepared in different ways, they are less than interspecies variation, e.g. with e. coli and p. mirabilis, r = 0.46. any differences which are due preparation method can be overcome by standardization of technique.

TI  == effects of bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on the urokinase and sialidase (neuraminidase) activity.
AB  == it has been hypothesized that urinary urokinase and sialidase may play a role in  urolithiasis. if these theories have substance it is to be expected that microorganisms may also affect these enzymes, since the association between urinary tract infection and renal stone formation is well known. it is generally  assumed that proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus albus, which produce the urea-splitting enzyme urease, are responsible for stone formation. however, the importance of non-urease-producing microorganisms (escherichia coli and enterococcus) in urolithiasis is unclear. spectrophotometric studies were therefore devised to clarify this problem. microorganisms associated with infection-induced stones (proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli) respectively inhibited the urokinase and stimulated the sialidase activity. in contrast, microorganisms which were not associated with infection stones (bacillus subtilis) had significantly less effect on urokinase and sialidase activity. this study may explain infection-induced stone formation and could open a completely new line of research.

TI  == pathogenesis of intraabdominal abscess formation: abscess-potentiating agents and inhibition of complement-dependent opsonization of abscess-inducing bacteria.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli are synergistic in the production of intraabdominal abscesses. however, these bacteria initiate abscess formation only when inoculated with an agent such as autoclaved colonic contents (acc) or bran (a fiber analogue). the mechanism of action of the abscess-potentiating agent was studied. opsonins in normal mouse serum were determined for phagocytic killing by murine neutrophils of b. fragilis and e. coli. opsonization required fixation of  complement by the alternative pathway. acc (0.2 mg/ml) and bran (1.0 mg/ml) inhibited phagocytic killing of proteus mirabilis in the presence of normal but not immune serum. assay of the alternative pathway of complement activation indicated that both bacterial components and abscess-potentiating agents in an abscess-inducing mixture activated complement. these findings suggest that abscess-potentiating agents inhibit opsonization and therefore the subsequent phagocytic killing of bacteria in the nonimmune host.

TI  == bacterial colonization behaviour: a new virulence strategy in urinary infections?
AB  == the urinary bladder resists bacterial colonization and infection by a number of mechanisms, one of which involves the sloughing of colonized uroepithelial cells. pathogens which thus become detached from bladder tissue are rapidly eliminated upon voiding of urine. during a recent study of bacterial colonization by the urinary pathogen, proteus mirabilis, we noted that it colonized glass surfaces such that organisms became widely and evenly dispersed over the surface. in contrast, pseudomonas fluorescens, a non-pathogen in the urinary tract, did not disperse over the surface but colonized and grew in such a manner as to form small clumps or microcolonies. other investigators have also shown that escherichia coli, a common urinary pathogen, initially colonizes bladders in a random, widely-dispersed fashion. we propose that successful bladder pathogens will predominantly adopt colonization behaviour that enables them to widely disperse over bladder tissue and, in so doing, avoid being cleared by the desquamation of uroepithelial cells. colonization behaviour would therefore represent a previously uncharacterized virulence strategy.

TI  == the penicillins.
AB  == the penicillin family of antibiotics remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. in general, these agents have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections caused by susceptible bacteria. the initial introduction of aqueous penicillin g for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an  important pharmacologic landmark. the emergence of penicillinase-producing staphylococcus aureus prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (for example, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin), in which an acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactam [corrected] ring. subsequently, the aminopenicillins (such as ampicillin and amoxicillin) were developed because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. their spectrum included escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella salmonella, listeria, haemophilus, and neisseria. the search for a penicillin with additional antimicrobial activity against the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa  led to the development of the carboxypenicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and temocillin) and the ureidopenicillins (mezlocillin, azlocillin, piperacillin, and apalcillin). finally, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid or sulbactam) and an aminopenicillin or ticarcillin has further extended their antibacterial spectra. the development of an ideal penicillin that is rapidly bactericidal, nonsensitizing, nontoxic, bioavailable, resistant to beta-lactamase, and without inoculum effect and that has a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins remains the goal.

AB  == in experiments on white mice the immunogenic potency of two variants of combined  vaccines prepared from strains of opportunistic bacteria was compared with that of monovaccines used as the components of the combined vaccines. all the vaccines under study were found highly immunogenic. decrease of monovaccine share in the combined vaccine did not reduce the immunogenic potency to any of the strains. an 8- to 16-fold increase in the level of specific antibodies in the colostric lactosera of cows immunized with combined vaccines was observed, and the survival rate of newborn calves increased 3- to 4-fold.

TI  == novel plasmid vectors for gene cloning in pseudomonas.
AB  == novel host-vector systems have been developed for gene cloning in the metabolically versatile bacterial genus pseudomonas. we found that a new pseudomonas strain, pseudomonas flavida if-4, isolated from soil, carried two small cryptic plasmids, named pni10 and pni20. they were multi-copy, but not self-transmissible, and the genome size was 3.7 kb for pni10 and 2.9 kb for pni20. several types of cloning vectors containing a kanamycin or streptomycin resistance (kmr or smr) gene were constructed from pni10 and pni20. these plasmid vectors were efficiently transformed into several strains of pseudomonas at a frequency up to 4 x 10(5) transformants per 1 microgram plasmid dna by the usual  competent cell method. the vectors derived from pni10 replicated not only in pseudomonas but also in some other gram-negative enteric bacteria such as escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  == tazobactam (ytr 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. a total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities  to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. in general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the mics of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, salmonella species and bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in mic50, mic90 and the geometric mean of mic. for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics did not change after adding tazobactam. for other species, there was a moderate decrease in mics. we conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.

TI  == proteus mirabilis flagella and mr/p fimbriae: isolation, purification, n-terminal analysis, and serum antibody response following experimental urinary tract infection.
AB  == urinary tract infection with proteus mirabilis may lead to serious complications, including cystitis, acute pyelonephritis, fever, bacteremia, and death. in addition to the production of hemolysin and the enzyme urease, fimbriae and flagellum-mediated motility have been postulated as virulence factors for this species. we purified mannose-resistant/proteuslike (mr/p) fimbriae and flagella from strains cft322 and hu2450, respectively. electron microscopy revealed highly concentrated preparations of fimbriae and flagella. fimbrial and flagellar structural subunits were estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 18.5 and 41 kda, respectively. n-terminal sequencing revealed that 10 of the first 20 amino acids of the major mr/p subunit matched the sequence of the p. mirabilis uroepithelial cell adhesin n terminus and 11 of  20 amino acids matched the predicted amino acid sequence of the escherichia coli  p fimbriae structural subunit, papa. in addition, 90 and 80% homologies were found between the first 20 amino acids of p. mirabilis flagellin and those of salmonella typhimurium phase-1 flagellin and the e. coli hag gene product, respectively. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified antigens showed a strong reaction between the mr/p fimbriae or flagella and sera of cba mice challenged transurethrally with p. mirabilis. a possible role for mr/p fimbriae in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection is supported by (i) a strong immune response to the antigen in experimentally infected animals, (ii) amino acid sequence similarity to other enteric surface structure, and (iii) our previously reported observation that mr/p fimbriae are expressed preferentially as the sole fimbrial type in human pyelonephritis isolates.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

TI  == smoking, humoral immunity, and ulcerative colitis.
AB  == since ulcerative colitis predominantly affects non-smokers and ex-smokers we have examined the possibility that smoking modifies the humoral immune response to an  antigenic challenge from the gut lumen. gut lavage was used in healthy subjects and patients with ulcerative colitis, including both smokers and non-smokers. antibodies in the intestinal fluid to escherichia coli (five pooled serotypes), candida albicans, gliadin, ovalbumin, and beta lactoglobulin were measured by elisa to determine specific antibody concentrations of igg, iga, and igm classes. total igg, iga, and igm were also measured in intestinal secretions and serum. in addition, circulating antibody concentrations of igg, iga, and igm to three gut commensals - e coli (five pooled serotypes) c albicans, and poroteus mirabilis were measured. there was a significant reduction in the iga concentration in intestinal fluid of smokers with ulcerative colitis compared with healthy non-smoking controls. no other significant differences were found between the groups. overall, these data are not consistent with the idea that smoking suppresses immune responses in the gut and suggest that the effect of smoking in  colitis is mediated by another mechanism.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), klebsiella spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., and salmonella spp.  this antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter spp., and morganella morganii. cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group a, b, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 less than 0.015 mg/l). the mics of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with mics below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. the frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. in this study isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. type 3, p, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. the klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. also, both type 3 and escherichia coli p fimbrial genotypes  were detected by using dna colony blot assays. the frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: enterobacter (38.6%), klebsiella (26.8%), serratia (17.7%), e. coli (13%), and proteus (5.2%). isolates of klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. the phenotype and genotype for e. coli p fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. in addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of enterobacter aerogenes. finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among k. oxytoca and proteus mirabilis isolates. the frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role  for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.

TI  == antibacterial activities of amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic  acid correlated with beta-lactamase production.
AB  == amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. a total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested  for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in proteus mirabilis to 100% in klebsiella pneumoniac. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. for beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the mics of amoxicillin prominently in strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae and bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. their mic50s, mic90s and geometric means of mics all decreased 4 folds or greater. for beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the mics did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, proteus vulgaris and e. cloacae.

TI  == evidence for n----o acetyl migration as the mechanism for o acetylation of peptidoglycan in proteus mirabilis.
AB  == o-acetylated peptidoglycan was purified from proteus mirabilis grown in the presence of specifically radiolabelled glucosamine derivatives, and the migration of the radiolabel was monitored. mild-base hydrolysis of the isolated peptidoglycan (to release ester-linked acetate) from cells grown in the presence  of 40 microm [acetyl-3h]n-acetyl-d-glucosamine resulted in the release of [3h]acetate, as detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography. the inclusion of either acetate, pyruvate, or acetyl phosphate, each at 1 mm final concentration,  did not result in a diminution of mild-base-released [3h]acetate levels. no such  release of [3h]acetate was observed with peptidoglycan isolated from either escherichia coli incubated with the same radiolabel or p. mirabilis grown with [1,6-3h]n-acetyl-d-glucosamine or d-[1-14c]glucosamine. these observations support a hypothesis that o acetylation occurs by n----o acetyl transfer within the sacculus. a decrease in [3h]acetate release by mild-base hydrolysis was observed with the peptidoglycan of p. mirabilis cultures incubated in the presence of antagonists of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, penicillin g and d-cycloserine. the absence of free-amino sugars in the peptidoglycan of p. mirabilis but the detection of glucosamine in spent culture broths implies that n----o transacetylation is intimately associated with peptidoglycan turnover.

TI  == cytotoxicity of the hpma hemolysin and urease of proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris against cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells.
AB  == proteus mirabilis, a common agent of nosocomially acquired and catheter-associated bacteriuria, can cause acute pyelonephritis. in ascending infections, bacteria colonize the bladder and ascend the ureters to the proximal  tubules of the kidney. we postulate that proteus species uses the hpma hemolysin  and urease to elicit tissue damage that allows entry of these bacteria into the kidney. to study this interaction, strains of proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris and their isogenic hemolysin-negative (hpma) or isogenic urease-negative (urec) constructs were overlaid onto cultures of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (hrptec) isolated from kidneys obtained by immediate autopsy. cytotoxicity  was measured by release of soluble lactate dehydrogenase (ldh). two strains of p. mirabilis inoculated at 10(6) cfu caused a release of 80% of total ldh after 6 h, whereas pyelonephritogenic hemolytic escherichia coli cft073 released only 25% at 6 h (p less than 0.012). ten p. mirabilis isolates and five p. vulgaris isolates  were all hemolytic and cytotoxic and produced urease which was induced by urea. the hpma hemolysin is apparently responsible for the majority of cytotoxicity in  vitro since the hemolysin-negative (hpma) mutants of p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris were significantly less cytotoxic than wild-type strains. p. mirabilis wpm111 (hemolysin negative) was used to test the effect of urease-catalyzed urea hydrolysis on hrptec viability. in the presence of 50 mm urea, wpm111 caused the  release of 42% of ldh versus 1% at 6 h in the absence of substrate (p = 0.003). we conclude that the hpma hemolysin of proteus species acts as a potent cytotoxin against hrptec. in addition, urease apparently contributes to this process when substrate urea is available.

AB  == twenty-nine children, including 20 boys and 9 girls, were enrolled in an open trial of oral cefixime therapy for common pediatric infectious diseases. patients aged between 0.5 month and 12 years with a mean +/- standard deviation of 2.3 +/- 2.8 years. the diagnoses included 10 of acute otitis media, 2 of purulent rhinitis, 4 of acute enterocolitis, and 13 of urinary tract infection. most children received 6-12 mg/kg/day of cefixime granules, orally twice daily for more than five days. all 10 cases (100%) of acute otitis media and 2 cases of purulent rhinitis were either cured, or improved by oral cefixime treatment. none of them was microbiologically evaluable. four cases (100%) of acute enterocolitis, 3 due to salmonella group b, one due to shigella flexneri, were also successfully treated with bacteria eradication. however, the cure rate of 13 cases of urinary tract infection was only 85% (11/13). seven escherichia coli and 4 proteus mirabilis infections were eradicated, whereas one each of enterobacter  cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae infections did not respond to treatment; these  two cases had a complicated course. the overall cure and improvement rate was 93%. although five patients had transient episodes of mild diarrhea, no significant adverse reaction was observed. in summary, oral cefixime given twice  daily was effective and safe in the treatment of a variety of common infectious diseases in pediatric patients.

TI  == antibacterial properties of human amniotic membranes.
AB  == amniotic membranes are widely used in a multitude of surgical applications and have been shown to reduce bacterial counts and promote healing in infected wounds. antibacterial properties of amniotic fluid are well documented and the presence of many potentially antibacterial factors has been demonstrated. no such factors have yet been found in amniotic membranes. we have applied a direct disc-diffusion susceptibility test to try to establish the possible existence of  such a factor. amniotic membranes did not inhibit five bacterial species when tested at 3 x 10(6) and 3 x 10(8) colony forming units/ml. however, complete growth inhibition of all organisms was seen immediately under the amniotic membrane discs. these results support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial effect of amniotic membranes in vitro is due to their close adherence to the wound surface.

TI  == differentiation of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides and haemophilus species in gram-stained direct smears.
AB  == the accuracy of examination of the gram-stained direct smear to classify presumptively gram-negative rods into three morphotype groups, that is, (a) enteric bacteria, (b) pseudomonas, and (c) bacteroides or haemophilus, was evaluated. randomly selected clinical strains (4-9) each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, ps. aeruginosa, b. fragilis, and h. influenzae were used to produce peritonitis or subcutaneous abscesses in mice. a  gram-stained direct smear was prepared from exudate collected from each animal. the direct smears were examined to classify bacteria observed into one of the three morphotype groups. the percent accuracy was 82, 56, and 95, respectively, and 76 overall. the assumption was made that classification was based primarily on differences in length and width of the organisms. to test this hypothesis, we  prepared scanning electron photomicrographs from each specimen of exudate and measured the lengths and widths of bacteria. examination of the gram-stained direct smear was more accurate for classification of enteric bacteria, h. influenzae, or b. fragilis. electron microscopy was more accurate for classification of ps. aeruginosa. the higher length-width radio should be helpful in recognizing ps. aeruginosa in direct smears.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluation of ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  == ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were  inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime  against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.

TI  == further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == it had already been shown with a single virulent strain (a42) of fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. the present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include bacillus cereus, klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include bacillus subtilis, 'bacteroides melaninogenicus', clostridium sporogenes, pasteurella haemolytica, and proteus mirabilis. the study also showed that five further virulent strains of f. necrophorum closely resembled a42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by escherichia coli. actinomyces (corynebacterium) pyogenes and s. aureus. one further strain (a6) of f. necrophorum resembled a42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by a. pyogenes, s. aureus, b. cereus and k. oxytoca but differed from it and the other  five strains in being only slightly affected by e. coli. this work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of f. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of lomefloxacin in vitro.
AB  == the mic of lomefloxacin was determined for 554 isolates from the urinary tract. some of the more resistant strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied in a dynamic in-vitro model in order to study dosing strategies. the model simulated, in mueller-hinton broth, the profile of plasma lomefloxacin concentrations in volunteers. bacteria were exposed to a range of lomefloxacin concentration profiles achievable by oral dosing. the first dose of lomefloxacin was rapidly bactericidal in a dose-dependent manner for all strains. on re-exposure, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed. drug-resistant mutants were readily isolated from all bacteria tested on lomefloxacin-containing plates. these occurred at a high frequency in p. aeruginosa (10(-1)), but less frequently in k. pneumoniae (10(-3)). p. mirabilis (10(-5)), and e. coli (10(-6)). the number of resistant mutants isolated tended to be lower with use of higher drug concentrations. the results suggest that lomefloxacin dosing regimens ensuring maintenance of a high serum concentration: mic ratio will result in maximal antibacterial effects and minimal problems with resistant strains.

TI  == the reca-recbcd dependent recombination pathways of serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis in escherichia coli: functions of hybrid enzymes and hybrid pathways.
AB  == the physical maps of cloned recbcd gene regions of serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis were correlated to genes located in this region. the genes thya, recc, recb, recd and arga were organized as in escherichia coli. the 3 rec  genes code for the 3 different subunits of the recbcd enzyme and produced enzymes promoting recombination and repair of uv damage in e coli. the recbcd-dependent stimulation of recombination at specific nucleotide sequences called chi (chi-activation) was determined in lambda red-gam-crosses. chi-activation by the  different recbcd enzymes decreased in the order e coli greater than s marcescens  greater than p mirabilis. in e coli cloned subunits genes from s marcescens and p mirabilis led to the formation of functional hybrid enzymes consisting of subunits from 2 or even 3 species. the origin of the recc subunit present in the  hybrid enzymes affected the degree of chi-activation. further, changes in chi-activation occurred when the recd subunit in the enzyme from e coli was replaced by recd proteins from s marcescens or p mirabilis. this suggested that the recd subunit determines not only whether or not chi-activation is possible but also to which extent it occurs. finally we have reconstituted recombination pathways of s marcescens and p mirabilis by combining the cloned reca and recbcd  genes from these species in e coli deleted for reca and recbcd. both pathways can efficiently promote recombination and repair. studies are summarized which showed that levels of repair and recombination promoted by the reca-recbcd genes are mostly higher when the reca and recbcd genes came from the same species than from 2 different species (hybrid recbcd recombination pathway). the data are interpreted to provide evidence that in vivo the reca protein co-operates with the recbcd enzyme in recombination and repair of uv damage.

TI  == shuttle cloning and nucleotide sequences of helicobacter pylori genes responsible for urease activity.
AB  == production of a potent urease has been described as a trait common to all helicobacter pylori so far isolated from humans with gastritis as well as peptic  ulceration. the detection of urease activity from genes cloned from h. pylori was made possible by use of a shuttle cosmid vector, allowing replication and movement of cloned dna sequences in either escherichia coli or campylobacter jejuni. with this approach, we cloned a 44-kb portion of h. pylori chromosomal dna which did not lead to urease activity when introduced into e. coli but permitted, although temporarily, biosynthesis of the urease when transferred by conjugation to c. jejuni. the recombinant cosmid (pill585) expressing the urease  phenotype was mapped and used to subclone an 8.1-kb fragment (pill590) able to confer the same property to c. jejuni recipient strains. by a series of deletions and subclonings, the urease genes were localized to a 4.2-kb region of dna and were sequenced by the dideoxy method. four open reading frames were found, encoding polypeptides with predicted molecular weights of 26,500 (urea), 61,600 (ureb), 49,200 (urec), and 15,000 (ured). the predicted urea and ureb polypeptides correspond to the two structural subunits of the urease enzyme; they exhibit a high degree of homology with the three structural subunits of proteus mirabilis (56% exact matches) as well as with the unique structural subunit of jack bean urease (55.5% exact matches). although the ured-predicted polypeptide has domains relevant to transmembrane proteins, no precise role could be attributed to this polypeptide or to the urec polypeptide, which both mapped to a dna sequence shown to be required to confer urease activity to a c. jejuni recipient strain.

TI  == freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam  and piperacillin-tazobactam against strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis harbouring known beta-lactamases.
AB  == strains of escherichia coli (n = 124) and proteus mirabilis (n = 29) harboring known beta-lactamases were analyzed as to their susceptibility to ampicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin alone and in combination with sulbactam, clavulanate, and tazobactam. with tem 1-producing e. coli, a correlation between  specific beta-lactamase activity and the mic of piperacillin and ampicillin-sulbactam was observed. these strains also showed significant differences in susceptibilities to the various combinations, suggesting that, at  least in strains resistant to one combination, several beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations should be tested in the laboratory. all combinations tested enhanced the activity of the beta-lactam towards tem 1-producing e. coli,  piperacillin-tazobactam being the most active. the drugs were less active to oxa  1 enzymes; solely with piperacillin-tazobactam 90% of strains were within the therapeutic range of the drug. sulbactam acted synergistically to chromosomally encoded beta-lactamases, whereas amoxicillin-clavulanate was inactive. piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited all strains producing chromosomally encoded beta-lactamases at concentrations within the therapeutic range of the drugs. in contrast, tem 2 of p. mirabilis was not sensitive to ampicillin-sulbactam, but to the other combinations; here again piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active.

TI  == bacterial killing in vitro by abscess-derived neutrophils.
AB  == in the absence of antimicrobial therapy, bacteria such as bacteriodes fragilis, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis may persist within an intra-abdominal abscess in the presence of large numbers of neutrophils which, under optimal conditions in vitro, can readily phagocytose and kill the same bacterial strains. neutrophils taken from abscesses induced by gram-negative bacteria such as those  above contain viable organisms. on incubation in vitro in the presence of serum,  these neutrophils kill the bacteria phagocytosed in the abscess poorly, if at all, yet can readily kill organisms added in vitro. to determine possible mechanisms that might explain this, we examined the bactericidal activity in vitro of neutrophils from a range of abscesses induced by one or two species of bacteria plus an abscess-potentiating agent, bran. the organisms studied were b.  fragilis, e. coli, p. mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus. the killing in vitro of e. coli and p. mirabilis, engulfed within an abscess, was significantly less than that of the same organisms when they were added to the in-vitro assay. in contrast, the killing of s. aureus was similar, whether engulfed in vivo or in vitro. however, s. aureus was less susceptible to phagocytosis and killing in vitro than p. mirabilis or e. coli, and the killing of s. aureus during in-vitro  incubation of neutrophils that had engulfed the organism with in the abscess was  similar to that of the gram-negative bacteria engulfed within the abscess.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in vitro susceptibility response of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to a set of antibiotics was investigated in a survey comprising 19,380 positive cultures over a period of 5 years in a large hospital environment. four out of the five species (p. aeruginosa being the exception) presented a species-specific, drug-independent, rhythmic variation of their level of susceptibility to several antibiotics over the time of the study. the species-specific rhythmic responses were further characterized by spectral analysis, autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions. through this analysis  it was possible to rank the species according to their main period of oscillation. the longest period of oscillation was detected for s. aureus (38 months). k. pneumoniae and e. coli presented intermediate values (25 and 23 months respectively), and p. mirabilis the shortest period of oscillation (11 months). species displaying long periods of oscillation tended to present very low levels of susceptibility, while species displaying short periods of oscillation usually presented the highest levels of susceptibility observed. although some hospital environmental factors, such as drug consumption, were also analyzed, no correlation was found between them and the in vitro bacterial cyclic responses to antibiotics.

AB  == a new plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase (fpm-1) with an isoelectric point of 7.2 and a molecular weight of 26,000 was found in a cefuroxime-resistant clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis strain 6003. fpm-1 can be classified as a type i oxyimino-cephalosporinase on the basis of its substrate specificity and inhibition pattern by clavulanic acid etc., and its conferred resistance on both  the strain and transconjugants against most oxyme-type cephalosporins as well as  the older ones but not against cefamycins and a few exceptional oxyme-type cephalosporins such as ceftizoxime, ceftazidime and cefixime. in a murine systemic infection model, only these fpm-1-stable drugs exhibited protective activity against the fpm-1-producing p. mirabilis 6003 similar to that against a  nonproducing derivative strain. the fpm-1-mediated cefuroxime resistance in p. mirabilis 6003 was transferred to co-infected escherichia coli 7004 at frequencies between 3.8 x 10(-3) and 4.0 x 10(-2) in a murine ascending urinary tract infection model. in the same infection model due to the fpm-1-producing e.  coli transconjugant, fpm-1-stable cefixime was significantly more effective than  fpm-1-labile cefteram pivoxil, although both drugs had similar therapeutic effect against its fpm-1-nonproducing counterpart strain.

AB  == two controlled united states trials compared the safety and efficacy of cefpodoxime proxetil (100mg twice daily) with either cefaclor (250mg 3 times daily) or amoxicillin (250mg 3 times daily) in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. treatment duration was 7 days. 307 of 762 patients treated with cefpodoxime proxetil, 99 of 190 treated with cefaclor, and 57 of 185 treated with amoxicillin were evaluable for efficacy. 311, 99 and 59 pathogens were isolated from cefpodoxime proxetil, cefaclor and amoxicillin patients, respectively, the most common pathogens being escherichia coli, klebsiella spp.,  proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus saprophyticus. bacteriological cure rates were 80% (247/307), 82% (81/99) and 70% (40/57) for cefpodoxime proxetil, cefaclor and amoxicillin, respectively. respective clinical cure rates were 79% (242/307), 79% (78/99) and 72% (41/57). cefpodoxime proxetil was well tolerated,  and there was no significant difference between the groups in the overall incidence of adverse experiences. thus, cefpodoxime proxetil is efficacious and safe in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections and compares favourably with cefaclor and amoxicillin.

TI  == interspecies compatibility of selenoprotein biosynthesis in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == several species of enterobacteriaceae were investigated for their ability to synthesize selenium-containing macromolecules. seleniated trna species as well as seleniated polypeptides were formed by all organisms tested. two selenopolypeptides could be identified in most of the organisms which correspond  to the 80 kda and 110 kda subunits of the anaerobically induced formate dehydrogenase isoenzymes of e. coli. in those organisms possessing both isoenzymes, their synthesis was induced in a mutually exclusive manner dependent  upon whether nitrate was present during anaerobic growth. the similarity of the 80 kda selenopolypeptide among the different species was assessed by immunological and genetic analyses. antibodies raised against the 80 kda selenopolypeptide from e. coli cross-reacted with an 80 kda polypeptide in those  organisms which exhibited fermentative formate dehydrogenase activity. these organisms also contained genes which hybridised with the fdhf gene from e. coli.  in an attempt to identify the signals responsible for incorporation of selenium into the selenopolypeptides in these organisms we cloned a portion of the fdhf gene homologue from enterobacter aerogenes. the nucleotide sequence of the cloned 723 bp fragment was determined and it was shown to contain an in-frame tga (stop) codon at the position corresponding to that present in the e. coli gene. this fragment was able to direct incorporation of selenocysteine when expressed in the heterologous host, e. coli. moreover, the e. coli fdhf gene was expressed in salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis, indicating a high degree of conservation of the seleniating system throughout the enterobacteria.

TI  == ability of uropathogens to bind to tamm horsfall protein-coated renal tubular cells.
AB  == epithelial cells were isolated from a healthy human kidney and found to be of normal, renal tubular origin. the cells were maintained in tissue culture and found to secrete tamm horsfall protein (thp). three strains of uropathogenic escherichia coli, and one each of proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to adhere to the thp-coated tubular cells. extraneous thp bound to all the organisms except p fimbriated e. coli, and caused a reduction in the adhesion of type 1 fimbriated e. coli and p. mirabilis to the renal cells. however, irrespective of reduced adhesion in three of five strains tested, there was adequate evidence to indicate that thp does not competitively exclude all uropathogenic adhesion. on the contrary, its presence on renal cells may act to mediate bacterial colonization.

TI  == vaginal hysterectomy: cefuroxime, metronidazole or both?
AB  == a randomized double-blind prospective study on the efficacy of single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis compared cefuroxime versus metronidazole versus the combination of both agents in vaginal hysterectomy. overall antibiotic prophylaxis was effective in abscess prevention (one abscess in 68 patients). in  the metronidazole group a significantly higher grade of morbidity was observed: febrile morbidity 41% versus 4% in the two other groups; bacteriuria 73% versus 17% in the cefuroxime group, versus 13% in the combined group; urinary tract infection 23%, versus 0% in the two other groups; post-operative prescription of  antibiotics 41%, versus 0% in the two other groups. febrile morbidity and bacteriuria correlated positively with escherichia coli and proteus spp. these micro-organisms were recovered significantly more often from the vagina of patients in the metronidazole group. cefuroxime was successful, metronidazole failed in the prevention of minor morbidity. we could not observe any effect from the addition of metronidazole to the cefuroxime prophylaxis.

TI  == changes in the antibiotic sensitivities of urinary pathogens, 1971-1989.
AB  == all urinary pathogens from general practice and hospital have been tested for sensitivity to a range of antimicrobial agents for the last 19 years. there have  been marked changes during that time. in general practice there has been a considerable increase in the proportion of staphylococcal infections from 5.1% to a peak of 14.8% in 1982 and a more recent decline to 3.4%. there has also been a  decrease in the proportion caused by proteus mirabilis, from 9.2% to 5.0%. similar, but smaller changes have been observed in the proportions of hospital urinary tract infections (uti) caused by these organisms, while the proportion of hospital infections due to klebsiella spp. and enterobacter spp. has fallen from  16.8% to 9.2%. these and other changes have been reflected in changing patterns of sensitivity to antibiotics. in particular, sensitivity of urinary pathogens to ampicillin/amoxycillin has continued to fall both in general practice and in hospital. nalidixic acid resistance is becoming more important as the proportion  of gram-positive urinary pathogens (especially enterococci) increases. more organisms were sensitive to ciprofloxacin than the other drugs tested, with no evidence of increasing resistance over a six-year period. over the same time there has been a reduction of overall sensitivity of urinary pathogens to trimethoprim from 90.8% to 82.5% in general practice, with no significant change  in isolates from hospital practice.

TI  == genetic analysis of escherichia coli urease genes: evidence for two distinct loci.
AB  == studies with two uropathogenic urease-producing escherichia coli strains, 1021 and 1440, indicated that the urease genes of each are distinct. recombinant plasmids encoding urease activity from e. coli 1021 and 1440 differed in their restriction endonuclease cleavage sites and showed minimal dna hybridization under stringent conditions. the polypeptides encoded by the dna fragments containing the 1021 and 1440 urease loci differed in electrophoretic mobility under reducing conditions. regulation of urease gene expression differed in the two ureolytic e. coli. the e. coli 1021 locus is probably chromosomally encoded and has dna homology to klebsiella, citrobacter, enterobacter, and serratia species and to about one-half of the urease-producing e. coli tested. the e. coli 1440 locus is plasmid encoded; plasmids with dna homology to the 1440 locus probe were found in urease-producing salmonella spp., providencia stuartii, and two e.  coli isolates. in addition, the 1440 urease probe was homologous to proteus mirabilis dna.

TI  == interactions of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis with mouse mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  == five strains of enterobacteria (three of escherichia coli and two of proteus mirabilis) were studied to assess and compare their phagocytic uptake and intracellular killing by mouse macrophages. each strain was injected intraperitoneally into separate groups of mice and peritoneal exudate cells were  harvested after 3 min for phagocytosis to occur in vivo. acridine orange staining showed that there were approximately 10-fold fewer intracellular p. mirabilis than e. coli cells. the average numbers of viable intracellular bacteria per leucocyte were 0.03 and 0.02 for p. mirabilis strains m13 and h1, respectively, and 0.48, 0.45, and 0.28 for e. coli strains m14, a-d m5 and h40. thus, both p. mirabilis strains were ingested less readily than any of the three e. coli strains (p less than 0.01). the rates of in-vitro intracellular killing were similar for all five strains of bacteria. the intracellular killing constants (kk) for the three mouse isolates were 0.017, 0.016 and 0.020 min for e. coli m14 and a-d m5, and p. mirabilis m13, respectively; the kks for the two human isolates were 0.026 and 0.029/min for e. coli h40 and p. mirabilis h1, respectively. the kks for all five strains were not significantly different. assuming that the numbers of viable intracellular bacteria at the beginning of the assay represented 100% viability, 6-17% of the intracellular bacteria remained viable after 2 h, reflecting log10 3.9-5.6 bacteria (6-8) x 10(6) peritoneal exudate cells. intravenous injection of these five strains into separate groups of mice demonstrated that the p. mirabilis strains were more virulent than the e. coli strains. injection of each p. mirabilis strain was associated with ruffled fur and death, whereas mice given any of the three e. coli strains remained visibly healthy and none died. consistent with these observations, quantitation of viable bacteria in the liver and spleen showed that greater numbers of p. mirabilis m13 than of e. coli m14 or a-d m5 persisted in these organs; similarly greater numbers of p. mirabilis h1 than of e. coli h40 persisted in the liver and spleen. because the rates of intracellular killing of  these five strains were similar, the relative virulence of both strains of p. mirabilis appeared to be associated with decreased phagocytic uptake rather than  differences in intracellular survival.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. reevaluation of in vitro mic break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of minocycline (mino) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the mino disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied. clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the usa and europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. in this study, mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. mic80 values of mino against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. those against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. mic80 values against pseudomonas  aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., and citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. the inhibition zones obtained with  the disc method were compared with mics. the results of mino disc susceptibility  test either with 200 micrograms disc (showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of mics. in the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in mic values proposed are ( ) mic less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 50 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. the disc results of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results.  changing the lower 2 mic break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were  reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. the false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [susceptibilities of uropathogenic bacteria to ampicillin, cefazolin, cefmetazole and gentamicin. nine-year survey of changing patterns of susceptibilities].
AB  == we analyzed antibiotic susceptibilities of urinary isolates of escherichia coli,  klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, and indole (+) proteus group to ampicillin (abpc), cefazolin (cez), cefmetazole (cmz) and gentamicin (gm) in 69 laboratories in 1988 and also studied changing patterns of susceptibilities from 1980 to 1988. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined using the agar dilution method  (mueller-hinton agar, bbl) with inoculation of 10(6) cfu/ml of bacteria. ninety to 99% of the strains of e. coli, klebsiella spp. and p. mirabilis were inhibited at a concentration of 6.25 micrograms/ml of cez and cmz and of 1.56 micrograms/ml of gm. approximately 80% of the strains of indole (+) proteus group were inhibited at concentrations of 6.25 micrograms/ml of cmz and of 1.56 micrograms/ml of gm. however, resistance to abpc and cez was high, with 83% and 81% of the strains being not inhibited at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml of  abpc and cez, respectively. no significant changes in susceptibilities of the 4 bacteria to the above 4 antibiotics were observed over the 9 year period. no increase was found in the incidence of the resistant strains of the 4 bacteria to cmz and gm, nor of e. coli and klebsiella spp. to cez.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin bay  v 3522.
AB  == the activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to mics of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. it was more active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. groups b, c and g streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the mi"90 for streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for enterococci and listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most bacteroides spp. were resistant. the mic90 for beta-lactamase positive escherichia coli (producing primarily tem-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. the mic90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus  mirabilis, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. bay v 3522 was destroyed by tem-1, shv-1, tem-3 and p99 beta-lactamases.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of a proteus mirabilis dna fragment homologous to the 60k-rnpa-rpmh-dnaa-dnan-recf-gyrb region of escherichia coli.
AB  == a 6.5-kb dna fragment from proteus mirabilis hybridized to the escherichia coli dnaa gene. this dna fragment was cloned and the nucleotide (nt) sequence determined. the fragment is homologous to a region of the e. coli chromosome containing a part of the gene encoding a 60-kda membrane-associated protein (60k), the rnpa-rpmh-dnaa-dnan-recf genes, and the n-terminal part of the gyrb gene. the degree of homology is variable: the amino-acid (aa) sequence of a part  of the 60k protein and a part of the dnaa protein is only minimally conserved, whereas the c-terminal 148 aa of dnaa are identical in the two species. the conservation of the nt sequence between the rnpa gene and the gene encoding the 60k protein suggests that this region encodes a hitherto unrecognized protein. the orf for this protein partially overlaps the 3' end of the rnpa structural gene, and the degree of conservation suggests that this gene is important for these bacteria.

TI  == cloning, partial sequence, expression, and antigenic analysis of the filamentous  hemagglutinin gene of bordetella pertussis.
AB  == the gene coding for the filamentous hemagglutinin (fha), one of the main factors  involved in mediating adherence of bordetella pertussis to ciliated host cells, was cloned in escherichia coli, and the 3,500-base-pair nucleotide sequence encoding the amino-terminal region was determined. molecular cloning, together with the characterization of recombinant fha-related proteins produced in e. coli, revealed that the primary translation product is a protein of about 370 kilodaltons (kda). the mature 220-kda fha polypeptide secreted by b. pertussis is most probably generated by proteolytic processing that eliminates a carboxy-terminal portion of about 150 kda. the 1,087 amino-terminal residues of the predicted fha sequence showed a number of remarkable features. extensive homology to the serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis hemolysin proteins was  found between amino acids 91 and 205 of the fha sequence, suggesting involvement  of this fha domain in host cell binding or secretion of fha from b. pertussis. in addition, two regions containing repetitive amino acid sequences were identified. one region, extending from residues 382 to 664, was formed by six repeats, and a  second, extending from residues 701 to 912, contained three repeats. the reactivities of several recombinant fha-derived proteins with a panel of monoclonal antibodies identified at least four epitopes composing an immunoreactive domain present in the carboxy-terminal moiety of the mature fha.

TI  == comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  == thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (uti) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower uti) or a 14 day (upper uti) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper uti. overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. the infecting organisms were: escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), citrobacter freundii (three), klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter agglomerans, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis (one of each). all of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. the effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. the cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively.  there were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. in the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. one of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. in this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic uti.

TI  == direct introduction of a formamido group into the 7 alpha (6 alpha)-position of cephalosporins (penicillins).
AB  == a novel direct introduction of a formamido group into the 7 alpha (6 alpha)-position of cephalosporins (penicillins) was achieved by treatment of 7 beta (6 beta)-[(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-oxo-2,5-cyclohexadien-1- ylidene)methylimino]cephem (penam) esters with n,n-bis(trimethylsilyl)formamide,  followed by deblocking with girard reagent t to give the corresponding 7 alpha (6 alpha)-formamido-7 beta (6 beta)-amino derivatives. three 7 alpha-formamidocephalosporins were prepared by the conventional n-acylation of 7  alpha-formamidocephem. all of them were resistant to beta-lactamases, showing similar mic values against both of a pair of a beta-lactamase-producing strain and the corresponding non or low-producing strain of the same species of bacteria, when tested on staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii.

AB  == the dynamics of the formation of postvaccinal immunity after immunization with preparations obtained with the use of hydroxylamine (ha) preparations from proteus strains of different o serogroups, salmonella minnesota re-mutant and the common antimicrobial antigen isolated from escherichia coli 14 has been studied on mice with proteus peritonitis-bacteremia used as a model. the study has revealed that intraperitoneal immunization with proteus ha preparations stimulates the phagocytic activity of peritoneal mononuclear cells in mice and induces an increase in the titers of specific o antibodies. proteus antigens ensure the formation of anti-proteus immunity, preventing the death of the animals from peritonitis-bacteremia. the protection of mice from such infection resulting from the injection of the common antigens of gram-negative bacteria is  considerably less. these data are indicative of the possibility of using proteus  peritonitis-bacteremia as a model for the study of the protective potency of proteus vaccines.

TI  == the diagnosis of bacteriuria during pregnancy.
AB  == three diagnostic tests, nitur, urobact, and uricult, were evaluated in the detection of bacteriuria in 865 pregnant women. as reference method agar culture  was performed. heavy growth (greater than 10(5) cfu/ml) of urinary tract bacteria was considered a true positive result and demonstrated in 58 (6.7%) of the women, 14 of whom had gram-negative rods. the sensitivity of the nitrite test was extremely low (0.13). the test gave negative results in eight of 17 specimens yielding heavy growth of escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis. although the urobact test was highly sensitive as regards gram-negative infection, it had an unacceptably low (0.27) predictive value in positive tests. the sensitivity of the uricult test was low (0.35) in this study. the predictive value (0.50) of a positive test result may be acceptable, since just over half of the false positive results were explainable by moderate growth of urinary tract pathogens (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml). it is argued that semi-quantitative urine culture may be preferable to the rapid diagnostic methods studied for the screening of bacteriuria in pregnant women.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil was studied in an in-vitro model simulating doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg. strains of klebsiella spp. proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, and haemophilus influenzae were effectively reduced by a dose of 200 mg. while for esch. coli no dose-activity relationship was observed--the maximal effect was achieved with a simulated dose of 100 mg--staphylococcus aureus could be reduced effectively only by a simulated dose of 400 mg. the lower doses showed stepwise lower activities.  apart from broad spectrum beta-lactamases like shv 2 or tem 5 the presence of plasmid coded beta-lactamases in esch. coli and h. influenzae did not affect the  antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil. the results show that cefpodoxime was more active against gram-negative bacteria than amoxycillin, and comparable activity to intramuscular cefotiam in the in-vitro model.

TI  == morganella morganii urease: purification, characterization, and isolation of gene sequences.
AB  == morganella morganii, a very common cause of catheter-associated bacteriuria, was  previously classified with the genus proteus on the basis of urease production. m. morganii constitutively synthesizes a urease distinct from that of other uropathogens. the enzyme, purified 175-fold by passage through deae-sepharose, phenyl-sepharose, mono-q, and superose 6 chromatography resins, was found to have a native molecular size of 590 kilodaltons and was composed of three distinct subunits with apparent molecular sizes of 63, 15, and 6 kilodaltons, respectively. amino-terminal analysis of the subunit polypeptides revealed a high degree of conservation of amino acid sequence between jack bean and proteus mirabilis ureases. km for urea equalled 0.8 mm. antiserum prepared against purified enzyme inhibited activity by 43% at a 1:2 dilution after 1 h of incubation. all urease activity was immunoprecipitated from cytosol by a 1:16 dilution. antiserum did not precipitate ureases of other species except for one providencia rettgeri strain but did recognize the large subunits of ureases of providencia and proteus species on western blots (immunoblots). thirteen urease-positive cosmid clones of morganella chromosomal dna shared a 3.5-kilobase (kb) bamhi fragment. urease gene sequences were localized to a 7.1-kb ecori-sali  fragment. tn5 mutagenesis revealed that between 3.3 and 6.6 kb of dna were necessary for enzyme activity. a morganella urease dna probe did not hybridize with gene sequences of other species tested. morganella urease antiserum recognized identical subunit polypeptides on western blots of cytosol from the wild-type strain and escherichia coli bearing the recombinant clone which corresponded to those seen in denatured urease. although the wild-type strain and recombinant clone produced equal amounts of urease protein, the clone produced less than 1% of the enzyme activity of the wild-type strain.

TI  == cytotoxic activity of the proteus hemolysin hpma.
AB  == we previously showed that hpma is the hemolysin determinant most commonly found among proteus isolates. to assess the potential contribution of hpma to virulence, we first characterized the toxic activities of this hemolysin. hemolytic activity was present in total cell cultures and cell-free supernatants  of proteus clinical isolates as well as escherichia coli containing cloned hpm genes. hpma also possesses cytotoxic activity which was detected by a chromium release assay against a variety of target cell lines (daudi, raji, t24, u937, and vero). analysis of the dose response of bacterial cells against both t24 cells and erythrocytes showed that e. coli containing cloned hpm genes was 30-fold more cytotoxic than proteus mirabilis ba6163. also, 10(5)-fold more bacterial cells were needed to lyse t24 cells than to lyse erythrocytes. hpma- mutants of two proteus strains in which the central portion of hpma was deleted were constructed. these hpma- mutants, which have lost the hemolytic and cytotoxic activities exhibited by their respective parent strains, demonstrate that hpma is needed for both of these activities. in an ascending model of murine urinary tract infection, the hpma mutant strain wpm111 behaved no differently from its parent strain, ba6163, with respect to either the level of kidney colonization or histopathological changes in the kidney. however, wpm111 had a sixfold higher 50% lethal dose than ba6163 when injected intravenously into c3h mice.

TI  == the hpma hemolysin is more common than hlya among proteus isolates.
AB  == two different hemolysins, hpma and hlya, have been reported in proteus spp. to study the distribution of these hemolysins among proteus strains, isolates from various infections and normal feces were screened for hemolysin production. all 63 proteus mirabilis strains and 23 of the 24 proteus vulgaris strains produced a calcium-independent hemolytic activity detectable in cell-free supernatants. the  calcium-independent activity was due to hpma; this activity correlated with the presence of hpma sequences and the production of an extracellular 166-kilodalton  (kda) protein that reacted with anti-hpma antiserum. hpma- mutants, constructed by deletion of the central portion of the hpma gene, did not produce the 166-kda  protein and were no longer hemolytic when compared with their respective parent strains. among the 87 p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris isolates examined, calcium-dependent hemolytic activity was produced by only two p. vulgaris strains. these strains produced a 110-kda protein which comigrated with the escherichia coli hemolysin (hlya) antibodies in immunoblots. these studies show that proteus spp. produce two distinct extracellular hemolysins, with nearly all  strains producing the calcium-independent hemolysin, hpma, but only an occasional p. vulgaris isolate producing hlya.

AB  == representative isolates of nonmucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied to investigate the hypothesis that mucinophilic and chemotactic properties in this species act as potential factors in the initial stages of pulmonary colonization  in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). transmission electron microscopy with a surfactant monolayer technique was used in a novel manner to demonstrate the adhesion of all 10 p. aeruginosa strains examined to porcine gastric mucin and tracheobronchial mucin from a patient with cf. control experiments showed that escherichia coli k-12 and single representatives of proteus mirabilis and klebsiella aerogenes did not bind to these mucins. the adler capillary technique, used to measure bacterial chemotactic response, showed that purified cf mucin acted as a chemoattractant for most p. aeruginosa strains, with the exception of  the nonmotile mutant m2fla- and the nonchemotactic mutant wr-5. the ability of the major sugar and amino acid components of mucin to act as chemoattractants was investigated. the degree of chemotaxis was strain specific; optimum chemotaxis was observed toward serine, alanine, glycine, proline, and threonine. no strain showed chemotaxis to n-acetylneuraminic acid, but all strains showed a strain-dependent chemotactic response to the sugars l-fucose, d-galactose, n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, and n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. these results provide new information on the mucinophilic and chemotactic properties of nonmucoid p. aeruginosa and support the hypothesis that these properties could play a role in  the initial stages of pulmonary colonization in patients with cf.

AB  == the leukotoxin of pasteurella haemolytica has been implicated as one of the major virulence factors contributing to the pathogenesis of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis. to gain a better understanding of the various biochemical, antigenic and toxigenic properties of the toxin, the genetic determinant (lkt) which encodes the leukotoxin has been cloned from p haemolytica serotype 1. results from the molecular characterization of this determinant showed that four  genes are required to synthesize and secrete the active toxin from p. haemolytica. this information provides the basis for genetic manipulation of the  determinant to produce different "forms" of the leukotoxin for various studies. in addition, lkt was found to be homologous to the alpha-hemolysin determinant (hly) of escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis and morganella morganii. further evidence is being accumulated demonstrating the presence of the lkt/hly determinant in several species of actinobacillus and haemophilus. this suggests the wide dissemination of the lkt/hly determinant in many pathogenic bacteria and established the family of rtx cytotoxins.

TI  == the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in st  thomas' hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  == we have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. among the gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. the enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to  the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. we have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. although  many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.

TI  == nucleotide sequencing of the proteus mirabilis calcium-independent hemolysin genes (hpma and hpmb) reveals sequence similarity with the serratia marcescens hemolysin genes (shla and shlb).
AB  == we cloned a 13.5-kilobase ecori fragment containing the calcium-independent hemolysin determinant (pwpm110) from a clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis (477-12). the dna sequence of a 7,191-base-pair region of pwpm110 was determined. two polypeptides are encoded in this region, hpmb and hpma (in that transcriptional order), with predicted molecular masses of 63,204 and 165,868 daltons, respectively. a putative fur-binding site was identified upstream of hpmb overlapping the -35 region of the proposed hpm promoter. in vitro transcription-translation of pwpm110 dna and other subclones confirmed the assignment of molecular masses for the predicted polypeptides. these polypeptides are predicted to have nh2-terminal leader peptides of 17 and 29 amino acids, respectively. nh2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of purified extracellular hemolysin (hpma) confirmed the cleavage of the 29-amino-acid leader peptide in the secreted form of hpma. hemolysis assays and immunoblot analysis of escherichia coli containing subclones expressing hpma, hpmb, or both indicated that hpmb is necessary for the extracellular secretion and activation of hpma. significant nucleotide identity (52.1%) was seen between hpm and the shl hemolysin gene sequences of serratia marcescens despite differences in the g+c contents of these genes (hpm, 38%; shl, 65%). the predicted amino acid sequences  of hpmb and hpma are also similar to those of shlb and shla, the respective sequence identities being 55.4 and 46.7%. predicted cysteine residues and major hydrophobic and amphipathic domains have been strongly conserved in both proteins. thus, we have identified a new hemolysin gene family among gram-negative opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == hlyb-dependent secretion of hemolysin by uropathogenic escherichia coli requires  conserved sequences flanking the chromosomal hly determinant.
AB  == the synthesis and secretion of hemolysin (hlya) by escherichia coli are governed  by four contiguous genes (hlycabd) that are closely conserved on plasmids and, among human pathogenic strains, on the chromosome. we have previously shown that  in plasmid phly152 the coexpressed synthesis and export functions are uncoupled by intraoperon transcription termination, which is in turn alleviated by antitermination dictated in cis by a region upstream of the hly operon. in this study we describe an analogous region of ca. 1,100 base pairs flanking the chromosomal hly determinant of the uropathogenic strain e. coli 2001. this region had no significant effect on intracellular levels of hemolysin but activated strongly, both in cis and in trans, the specific hlyb-hlyd-dependent hemolysin secretion function. the secretion-activating region increased the transcription of the secretion gene hlyb, but the transcription effect was not as pronounced as that seen in the phly152 determinant and was not evident when the region was present in trans to the hemolysin genes, suggesting that, in addition to transcriptional activation, the region may possibly exert a secondary posttranscriptional influence. southern hybridizations with the 1,100-base pairs  secretion-activating sequence showed low identity to plasmid phly152 and no identity with total dna from nonhemolytic uropathogenic e. coli or hemolytic isolates of proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii. in contrast, hybridization to total dna from hemolytic e. coli isolates belonging to different serotypes showed strong conservation of the activating sequence, indicating that it is an integral component of the chromosomal hly determinant that is widespread among uropathogenic e. coli.

AB  == a nationwide survey of susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp. and proteus mirabilis initiated in 1980 was continued in 1986. this report documents differences in susceptibilities of clinical isolates  of the above microorganisms to ampicillin (abpc), cefazolin (cez), cefmetazole (cmz) and gentamicin (gm) among general hospitals throughout japan. clinical isolates of each species of microorganisms which were collected in 24 hospitals made up each study group and were collected at the kosei general hospital, tokyo, from april 1980 to march 1986. we compared the variability in the resistant rates (mic greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml) and mics of each antibiotic for 50% and 80% of the isolates among the hospitals. mics were determined by the serial 2 fold agar plate dilution method, standardized by the japan society of chemotherapy, with an inoculum of approximately 10(6) cfu/ml or 10(8) cfu/ml. susceptibility patterns of s. aureus to abpc, cez and gm, of e. coli to abpc, of  klebsiella sp. to cez and gm and of p. mirabilis to abpc, cez and gm varied from  hospital to hospital. on the other hand, the differences in the susceptibility patterns among the 6 districts of japan were not obvious, because the differences were affected by different susceptibility patterns of each hospital located in each district.

TI  == the effect of bacterial products on human fibroblast and keratinocyte detachment  and viability.
AB  == an in vitro model has been developed to study the effect of soluble bacterial products on the viability and detachment of skin cell types utilized cultured grafts. microbial products prepared from clinical isolates of bacterial species which most commonly colonize burn lesions showed marked variation in their ability to detach and kill both keratinocytes and fibroblasts. all three isolates of acinetobacter spp. tested were effective in causing detachment and death of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, whereas escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter spp. tested had little, or no, effect on detachment or viability for either skin cell type. four staphylococcus aureus isolates elicited variable strain-dependent results with regard to detachment and viability. one isolate possessed activity specific for keratinocyte detachment and death. these results  indicate the possible undesirable effects such bacterial species may have on graft success in colonized burn wounds.

TI  == hemolysin as a marker for serratia.
AB  == all serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. dna fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal dna of s. marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. kiliensis, s. grimesii, s. proteamaculans, s. plymutica, s. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. the restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. s. ficaria and s. marinorubra expressed  a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the s. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. the dna of the latter strains did not hybridize with the s. marcescens hemolysin dna probes. some s. marcescens strains, s. kiliensis and s. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. no hybridization was found with dna of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella arerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosus, listeria sp.,  aeromonas sp., legionella sp. and a meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin dna probes are specific for serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than serratia.

AB  == a total fraction of triterpenic glycosides from cucumaria japonica named cucumarioside was used as a stimulator of nonspecific resistance to bacterial infections in mice. after intraperitoneal administration to mice subsequently infected with various strains of e. coli and proteus mirabilis, cucumarioside provided survival of 40 to 90 per cent of the infected animals against 100 per cent in the control group. the protective effect directly depended on the dose of cucumarioside. it was optimal to administer the preparation 3 days before the infection. when the preparation was administered at such periods ld50 for neisseria meningitidis bt-2 and salmonella minnesota sf 1111 lowered 5 and 4.3 times, respectively. therefore, the total fraction of triterpenic glycosides from far eastern holothuria had a marked ability to increase natural resistance of the animals to infections caused by various gram-negative organisms.

TI  == proteus mirabilis urease: nucleotide sequence determination and comparison with jack bean urease.
AB  == proteus mirabilis, a common cause of urinary tract infection, produces a potent urease that hydrolyzes urea to nh3 and co2, initiating kidney stone formation. urease genes, which were localized to a 7.6-kilobase-pair region of dna, were sequenced by using the dideoxy method. six open reading frames were found within  a region of 4,952 base pairs which were predicted to encode polypeptides of 31.0  (ured), 11.0 (urea), 12.2 (ureb), 61.0 (urec), 17.9 (uree), and 23.0 (uref) kilodaltons (kda). each open reading frame was preceded by a ribosome-binding site, with the exception of uree. putative promoterlike sequences were identified upstream of ured, urea, and uref. possible termination sites were found downstream of ured, urec, and uref. structural subunits of the enzyme were encoded by urea, ureb, and urec and were translated from a single transcript in the order of 11.0, 12.2, and 61.0 kda. when the deduced amino acid sequences of the p. mirabilis urease subunits were compared with the amino acid sequence of the jack bean urease, significant amino acid similarity was observed (58% exact matches; 73% exact plus conservative replacements). the 11.0-kda polypeptide aligned with the n-terminal residues of the plant enzyme, the 12.2-kda polypeptide lined up with internal residues, and the 61.0-kda polypeptide matched with the c-terminal residues, suggesting an evolutionary relationship of the urease genes of jack bean and p. mirabilis.

TI  == functional analyses of proteus mirabilis wild-type and mutant recbcd enzymes in escherichia coli reveal a new mutant phenotype.
AB  == cloned into escherichia coli the recb, recc and recd genes of proteus mirabilis produce a recbcd enzyme (exov) functional in recombination and dna repair. the direction of transcription of recb, recc and recd, the sizes of the enzyme subunits, and their composition in the active enzyme are similar to that observed for the e. coli enzyme. in lambda crosses, the p. mirabilis enzyme has only about 40% of the chi activity of the e. coli enzyme. the recbcd genes were also cloned  from an exov mutant of p. mirabilis which is u.v.-sensitive and partly deficient  in exov. the defect was attributed to the recb gene by complementation studies. in a recbcd deletion strain of e. coli, the enzyme from the mutant produced 40% of conjugational recombinants and had retained about 25% of chi activity. however, it did not restore normal dna repair, cell viability or recombination in lambda crosses and p1 transduction. the new mutant phenotype is discussed in the  light of the assumption that prokaryotic recbcd enzymes can promote recombination in a chi-dependent and a chi-independent manner.

(five/four), pseudomonas aeruginosa (two/three), haemophilus influenzae (one/one), proteus mirabilis (two/zero), proteus vulgaris  (one/zero), salmonella sp. (zero/two), plesiomonas shigelloides (one/zero), and others (one/four). the clinical responses were cure or improvement in 31 ciprofloxacin cases/21 ceftazidime cases; failure, zero/four; and indeterminate,  two/one. the bacteriologic responses were eradication in 28 ciprofloxacin cases/22 ceftazidime cases; persistence, one/three; and indeterminate, four/one.  mild intolerance occurred in three ciprofloxacin cases and two ceftazidime cases. a mild increase in serum hepatic enzymes was observed in two patients in each group. superinfections occurred in five patients: enterococcal septicemia (zero/two) and urinary tract infections (one/two). the results presented suggest  that intravenous ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe antimicrobial agent for the treatment of serious infections, with an efficacy comparable with that of ceftazidime, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. an additional advantage seems to be  a lower rate of superinfections.

AB  == because specific outpatient epidemiologic data on the susceptibility of organisms are not readily available to guide empiric antibiotic therapy in the ambulatory setting, we reviewed all positive culture reports of clinical specimens (n = 935) isolated exclusively from outpatients of the eastern carolina family practice center over a 1-year period. eighty percent were from urine cultures, 12 percent  from wound cultures, and 5 percent from sputum cultures. an antibiogram was developed that showed a pattern of bacterial resistance similar to that reported  elsewhere. more than 80 percent of urinary tract infections were caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. more than 50 percent of skin and soft tissue infections were caused by staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus species. susceptibilities of these organisms were compared with those reported by the local hospital, and antimicrobial resistance  patterns were similar, which suggests that the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy can follow susceptibility patterns derived from either inpatient or outpatient laboratories in areas with similar resistance patterns. further research into the epidemiology and susceptibility of organisms isolated from outpatients is needed. whether the susceptibility of inpatient and outpatient antimicrobial resistance found in this investigation can be extrapolated to other geographic areas remains to be determined.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == susceptibilities to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents of bacterial strains isolated from urinary tract infections at 8 hospitals in japan from july  to october in 1986 are summarized as follows. 1. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (st) and imipenem (ipm) with mic90s  of 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml. minocycline had the strongest activity against staphylococcus aureus; the mics for all strains tested were lower than 0.39 microgram/ml. the mic80s of dicloxacillin, and arbekacin (hbk) were 0.20 and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. among the cephems, the mic80 of flomoxef was 25 micrograms/ml, whereas those of cefmenoxime (cmx) and cefotiam (ctm) were 50 micrograms/ml. 2. escherichia coli was most susceptible to ofloxacin (oflx) among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested. oflx showed the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% (mic90) of the 274 strains of e. coli tested to be lower than 0.10 microgram/ml. the antibacterial activities of the third generation cephems such as cmx and latamoxef (lmox) were the strongest among the  injectable antibiotics tested. the mic90s of cmx and lmox were lower than 0.10 and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. ctm and cefmetazole, the second generation cephems, were also highly active against e. coli with mic90s of 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested, oflx was the most active against klebsiella pneumoniae. its mic90  was 0.78 microgram/ml. among the injectable antibiotics tested, cmx was the strongest with an mic90 of 0.20 microgram/ml; mic90 of ctm and lmox were 0.39 microgram/ml. 4. the tested antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally less active against citrobacter freundii than against other bacteria. the mic80 of oflx was 0.39 microgram/ml. gentamicin (gm) and st were slightly active against c. freundii. among the cephems, cmx had the mic80 of 25 micrograms/ml. 5. enterobacter cloacae was less susceptible to the cephems tested. oflx, gm, and mecillinam were active against this bacteria with mic80s of 0.78, 0.78 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 6. among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents and penicillins examined, piperacillin (pipc) was the most active against  proteus mirabilis. its mic90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. those of sulbenicillin, cefaclor, ampicillin, oflx, and st were 0.78, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. cmx was highly active against p. mirabilis with an mic90 of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml; lmox followed with an mic90 of  0.20 microgram/ml among the injectable antibiotics tested. ctm was also active against this bacterium; the mic90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. 7. the antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally only slightly active against proteus vulgaris.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == in-vitro activity of cefetamet (ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  == the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. the broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. none of the compounds was effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains. cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae. proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of s. epidermidis strains. in biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. it did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with esch. coli. this observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a c-3 vinyl group. its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime,  and amoxicillin-clavulanate. fk482 inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012  micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. it  did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. fk482 inhibited 90% of enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. although 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, and shigella  species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, fk482 was less active than cefixime against citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella, serratia, and providencia species, with mics for many isolates of greater than 8  micrograms/ml. fk482 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. bacteroides and pseudomonas species were resistant. fk482 was not hydrolyzed by the tem-1 and tem-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the proteus vulgaris enzyme. it had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cephalothin. reevaluation of mic break points in 4 category system of disc susceptibility test].
AB  == the reliability of the cephalothin (cet) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 248 strains and using showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cet) and difco discs (6 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cet). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cet disc tests, which is widely used in japan, was reevaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. the results obtained with the disc methods were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cet disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. with the showa disc susceptibility test, 15 out of the 248 strains (6.0%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. with the difco disc test, 18 out of the 248 strains (7.3%) tested showed false positive results and 6 (2.4%) showed false negative results. excluding enterococcus faecalis from the test, results because better in the quantitative estimation of  mics, resulting false positive rates of 3.2% (showa), and 4.4% (difco). a 3 category system of the interpretation of disc test is generally used in the usa and europe. mic break points proposed for the classification of the cet test are  sensitive, mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, and resistance, mic greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. with the showa disc susceptibility test, 14 out of the 248 strains (5.6%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains  (2.4%) showed false negative results. with the difco disc test 7 out of the 248 strains (2.8%) showed false positive results and 21 strains (8.5%) showed false negative results. in this study, mic70s of cet against staphylococcus aureus and  staphylococcus epidermidis were 1.56 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. cet was not so effective against gram-negative rods except klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. mic70s against k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and e. coli were 6.25, 3.13, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively.

TI  == in-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in canada.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and  campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and  two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both  meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps.

TI  == therapeutic activity of meropenem in experimental infections.
AB  == meropenem and comparative antibiotics were evaluated in five models of infection. all antibiotics were administered parenterally; imipenem was used in combination  with cilastatin but meropenem and other agents were given alone. generalized infections in mice caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa all responded to low doses of meropenem or imipenem. immunocompromised mice infected with ps. aeruginosa responded to slightly higher doses of meropenem or gentamicin but required four to seven times the dose of other agents. those given a greater challenge of ps. aeruginosa were treated most successfully by meropenem. treatment with meropenem, imipenem or ceftazidime caused significant reductions of e. coli in the urinary bladder and kidneys of mice challenged per urethram. infection with ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia localized to the subcutaneous neck tissue of guinea pigs was also treated successfully. lung infections caused by ps. aeruginosa in guinea pigs were treated effectively by meropenem, imipenem, and ceftazidime at the dose of 10 mg/kg but only meropenem eradicated bacteria from all the tissues examined. these results demonstrate that meropenem has excellent antibacterial activity in vivo in both normal and immunocompromised animals and in some models of infection is superior to imipenem.

TI  == epitope specificities of murine monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against enterobacterial lipopolysaccharides of the re chemotype.
AB  == murine monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the lipopolysaccharides (lps) of re mutants of salmonella minnesota, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli were serologically characterized. using natural re lps and natural and synthetic partial structures thereof, representing the 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid (kdo) or lipid a region or both, the epitope specificities of four monoclonal antibodies were defined. clones 20 (immunoglobulin m [igm]) and 25 (igg3) recognize a terminal alpha-pyranosidically linked kdo monosaccharide residue and the alpha-2,4-linked kdo disaccharide, respectively, as the immunodominant group. therefore, these two antibodies are core antibodies which do not require the presence of lipid a constituents for binding. the minimal structure enabling binding of clone 17 (igg2b) is a pseudotetrasaccharide of the sequence alpha-kdo-(2----4)-alpha-kdo-(2----6)-beta-glucosamine-(1----6)- glucosaminitol with two amide-linked 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid residues. the smallest structure with which clone 22 (igg3) reacted was de-o-acylated re lps. therefore, clones 17 and 22 are lps antibodies requiring both the lipid a and the kdo region for binding. phosphoryl residues of the lipid a moiety in re lps are dispensable  for the reaction with clone 17, whereas they are necessary for that with clone 22. these four different antibody types were also detected in polyclonal rabbit antisera and could be distinguished from each other by absorption experiments. it was found that type 20 and 25 antibodies either were not present or were present  only in small amounts and that the majority of the antibodies were of types 17 and 22. from these data, we conclude that the immunodominant structures of re lps comprise both the kdo and lipid a domains.

TI  == monoadduct forming photochemical reagents for labeling nucleic acids for hybridization.
AB  == we describe the synthesis of three angelicin derivatives which can be used for labeling nucleic acids with biotin. these compounds were used to label nucleic acids in the presence of lysed cell constituents. the resulting labelled nucleic  acids show hybridization to a genus specific probe for e. coli. the relative comparison of sensitivity indicates that a polyamine linker is better than a polyethylene oxide linker between the biotin and angelicin moieties.

TI  == monoclonal antibodies against three different enterobacterial outer membrane proteins. characterization, cross-reactivity, and binding to bacteria.
AB  == balb/c mice were immunized with whole-cells of escherichia coli 055:b5 or proteus mirabilis nctc 60 to produce broadly cross-reacting monoclonal antibodies (mabs)  against outer membrane (om) proteins. a total of 10 anti-om mabs of the igg class were selected. these included 5 mabs against the heat-modifiable (hm) protein, 3  against the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (palp), and 2 against braun's lipoprotein (blp). based on competition elisa, the mabs defined 2 hm protein binding sites (hm i and hm ii), 2 palp sites (palp i and palp ii), and one blp site (blp i). the mabs showed broad cross-reactivity against 74 strains of 10 different genera of the enterobacteriaceae. non-cross-reacting enteric bacilli occurred only among bacteria of the genera salmonella, proteus, and providentia.  the results revealed that proteus and providentia strains differed from other enteric bacilli with regard to blp synthesis or specificity. a panel of 30 non-enteric gram-negative bacteria did not cross-react. testing of mab binding to bacteria showed that a part of the blp i, palp i, and palp ii sites was immunoaccessible in intact homologous bacteria, and that the hm i and hm ii epitopes were inaccessible. the mabs should facilitate studies of structure and immunobiological function of enterobacterial om proteins and should have a potential as immunodiagnostic reagents.

TI  == results of microbiological investigations on the permeability of procedure and surgical gloves.
AB  == procedure gloves are considered to be important to prevent infections when handling potentially contaminated items. we tested two sorts of vinyl- and 4 sorts of polyethylene-copolymer-gloves, 20 gloves of each, towards the ability of proteus mirabilis atcc 15143 to penetrate the glove material. the gloves were fastened in bottles containing 700 ml sterile nutrient broth and then filled with 300 ml of a bacteria suspension having a density of 10(8) cfu/ml. the samples were taken directly and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 24 h after starting the test. immediately after the inoculation in 10 to 85% of the gloves a migration of proteus mirabilis could be detected. after 24 h the rate was 25 to 90%! the penetration of escherichia coli-lambda-phages (10(6) pfu/ml) was investigated in  a similar arrangement. here 20 to 90% of the gloves were previous in the first 5  to 10 min. additionally tested latex gloves were impermeable up to 4 h after inoculation. the results of this study lead to the conclusion that it is necessary to improve glove materials. to examine the impermeability for microorganisms the methods used in this investigation are recommended as quality  control procedures.

TI  == comparative activity of cefixime and cefaclor in an in vitro model simulating human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == the dependence of the antibacterial activity of the two oral cephalosporins cefixime and cefaclor on pharmacokinetic properties was investigated in an in vitro model using strains of enterobacteria and a streptococcal strain. in the cultures the course of serum concentrations of the respective antibiotic was simulated. the more rapidly attained (1 h) high peak levels (17.5 micrograms/ml)  of cefaclor (500 mg dose) in no case showed an advantage over the more slowly reached (3 h) low peak levels (2.5 micrograms/ml) of cefixime (200 mg dose). cefixime was comparable to cefaclor with respect to its initial killing velocity, whereas it was generally superior with respect to maximum values for reduction of bacterial counts. due to its long elimination half-life (2.5 h) cefixime prevented regrowth for at least twice as long as cefaclor, which has a short half-life (0.7 h). as a result of its antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic  properties cefixime can be administered less frequently than cefaclor.

TI  == rapid flow cytometric bacterial detection and determination of susceptibility to  amikacin in body fluids and exudates.
AB  == a flow cytometry-based method for rapid and quantitative detection of bacteria in various clinical specimens and for rapid determination of antibiotic effect is described. achieving such a measurement with high sensitivity required discrimination between bacteria and other particles which were often present in clinical samples in high concentrations. this discrimination was facilitated by detecting the bacterial characteristic light scatter and fluorescence signals following staining, e.g., with the fluorescent nucleic acid-binding dye ethidium  bromide, as well as by measuring bacterial proliferation during short time intervals. antibiotic susceptibility was measured by observing the inhibition of  such proliferation. the method was applied to 43 clinical specimens from various  sources, such as wound exudates, bile, serous cavity fluids, and bronchial lavage. bacterial detection, achieved in less than 2 h, agreed with results of conventional methods with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 88%. susceptibility to amikacin was detected in 1 h in 92% of 13 positive specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of enterobacteriaceae  (50 escherichia coli, 48 klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 enterobacter cloacae, 32 proteus mirabilis, 22 proteus indole-positive [providencia sp.], 24 serratia sp., and 12 citrobacter sp. all strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. in addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/ml. the highest intrinsic activity was observed against proteus sp. tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. it is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. thirty-two strains of pseudomonas and 960 strains of enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter sp., serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and salmonella enterica). tigemonam displayed good activity against enterobacteriaceae. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were as follows: mic50s were 0.01 mg/l for p. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/l for s. marcescens, mic90s were 0.03 mg/l for p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris and 4 mg/l for citrobacter freundii. tigemonam inhibited e. coli and p. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. despite mic90s of 9.5 and 4 mg/l for enterobacter and c. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. tigemonam was found to be inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, with mic50s and mic90s higher than 128 mg/l (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/l). tigemonam's activity was found to  be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against p. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (mic90, 8 mg/l for norfloxacin; mic50, 8 mg/l and mic90, 32 mg/l for aztreonam). cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
AB  == antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (cftm) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. antibacterial  activities of cftm against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (ccl). 2. activities of cefixime (cfix) were superior to those of cftm against b. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to cftm against s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus. 3. activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of  ccl against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and s. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to cftm and cfix against most of gram-negative rods. 4. sultamicillin (sbtpc) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its mics did not exceed the mics of ampicillin by itself. sbtpc showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.

TI  == postpartum bacteriuria. a multicenter evaluation of different screening procedures and a controlled short-course treatment trial with amoxycillin.
AB  == a total of 10,909 puerperal women from 6 different hospitals were screened for bacteriuria by culture of voided midstream urine (msu), and a significant growth  was found in 881 patients (8.1%). in 731 cases the urine was reexamined by using  suprapubic aspiration (spa), and in only 354 (48%) of the samples the diagnosis of bacteriuria was confirmed. the contamination rate of the msu samples varied from 46 to 69% between the different hospitals, indicating that in the postpartum period positive msu findings would necessitate more thorough examination in order to confirm the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. in our study, suprapubic aspiration was found to be a simple and acceptable method without any side effects. confirmed bacteriuria occurred in 3.2% of the women. operative delivery  (cesarean section, forceps and vacuum extractor delivery), epidural anesthesia and bladder catheterization increased the risk of bacteriuria in the postpartum period. only 27% of the women with positive bladder urine complained of dysuria and this symptom was significantly more common in women who had been catheterized. 230 patients with confirmed bacteriuria with amoxycillin-sensitive  bacterias participated in a randomized short-course treatment trial: 114 women received 3 days treatment with amoxycillin (1.5 g/day), 116 received the traditional 10 days therapy (750 mg amoxycillin/day). both antibiotic regimens were observed to be effective with a cure rate of 96 and 98%, respectively. short-course antibiotic treatment should thus be recommended to puerperal women with urinary tract infections since this avoids prolonged drug exposure to the lactating mother.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [effects of sulbactam on the activity of cefoperazone against various clinical isolates].
AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in japan and u.s.a., respectively. after an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of cpz and sbt in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. in urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. antimicrobial interaction  studies using various combinations of cpz and sbt were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of sbt on the antimicrobial activity of cpz in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. sbt increased the activity of cpz against various clinical isolates tested except enterococcus faecalis. cpz-sbt at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of cpz, resulting in decreases in mic values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. these drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. based on pharmacokinetic data for cpz and sbt, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of cpz-sbt at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in japan and u.s.a., respectively, are appropriate. the effect of sbt on the activity of cpz was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. sbt/cpz, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. the mic80 of sbt/cpz (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) cfu/ml inoculum size were as follows: s. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and e. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. those of gram-negative bacilli were: escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.

TI  == review of the in-vitro spectrum and characteristics of cefmetazole (cs-1170).
AB  == the in-vitro antimicrobial qualities of cefmetazole are summarized from a review  of over 30 publications. cefmetazole, a 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin, is shown to have an antimicrobial spectrum closely resembling cefoxitin's. however, cefmetazole is approximately two- to eight-fold more active than cefoxitin against commonly isolated species such as escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, pyogenic streptococci, pneumococci, and haemophilus influenzae. cefmetazole is also active against anaerobic pathogens, neisseria spp., citrobacter diversus, indole-positive proteus spp. and branhamella catarrhalis. cefmetazole is bactericidal against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. its mics and mbcs are minimally influenced by high inoculum  concentrations. beta-lactamases failed to hydrolyze cefmetazole significantly and cefmetazole is considered the most stable of the cephamycin drugs. some bacteroides strains produce beta-lactamases that are uniquely inhibited by cefmetazole. in-vitro tests with cefmetazole have been evaluated and interpretive criteria established for nccls methods: susceptible greater than or equal to 18 mm (less than or equal to 8.0 mg/l) and resistant less than or equal to 14 mm (greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). the consistent cross-resistance and -susceptibility observed between cefmetazole and cefoxitin requires the testing of only one of these agents routinely. quality control guidelines for cefmetazole disc diffusion (30 micrograms disc) and dilution tests are summarized in this review.

AB  == a monoclonal antibody against the yersinia enterocolitica 60-kilodalton (kda) antigen, designated cross-reacting protein antigen (crpa), was obtained by cell fusion. the crpa common to gram-negative bacteria was purified from y. enterocolitica by the affinity chromatography with the monoclonal antibody (igg1) thus obtained. the purified crpa showed a single band of 60 kda in sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), and reacted with rabbit antisera against y. enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei in western blot analysis. the monoclonal antibody, however, reacted with a 60 kda peptide from y. enterocolitica, but not with the antigens from other gram-negative bacteria such  as v. cholerae, e. coli, s. sonnei, salmonella enteritidis, serratia marcescens,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa. the results suggested that both species-specific and cross-reactive epitopes were present on  a crpa molecule.

TI  == clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin in the therapy of severe infections in high-risk patients.
AB  == a clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  imipenem/cilastatin in life-threatening infections in high-risk patients. thirty  hospitalized patients (22 men and 8 women), aged 28 to 78 years, with impaired host defences and severe infections were treated with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage ranging between 1 and 3 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. the average length of therapy was 8.61 +/- 3.14 days. the isolated organisms were as follows: escherichia coli [7], pseudomonas aeruginosa [9], staphylococcus aureus [5], streptococcus faecalis [3], strep. viridans [1], proteus mirabilis [1], p. vulgaris [2], klebsiella pneumoniae [2], citrobacter freundii [2], bacteroides fragilis [2]. in only one patient the aetiological agent remained unknown and in  five patients (16.67%) a mixed infection was observed. twenty-four patients (80%) were completely cured of infection and 29 isolated organisms (82.86%) were eradicated. no important side-effects were observed.

TI  == morphological lesions of the rat urinary tract induced by inoculation of mycoplasmas and other urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == the effects on the urinary tract after inoculation of ureaplasma urealyticum into the rat bladder were evaluated and compared to that seen after mycoplasma hominis, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis inoculation. the inoculation of the urease-producing organisms p. mirabilis and u. urealyticum were associated with the formation of struvite bladder stones and predominantly hyperplastic lesions of the bladder. the p. mirabilis inoculated rats also displayed marked pyelonephritis. a similar but much less pronounced reaction also occurred in the  kidneys of some of the u. urealyticum inoculated rats. p. mirabilis could frequently be recultured. in contrast, this was not possible with u. urealyticum, but the organism was detected by scanning electron microscopy 2 weeks after the inoculation. inoculation of m. hominis was associated with a few mild lesions of  the bladder, but inflammatory lesions were not present in the kidneys. the study  confirms the potential of ureaplasma to form struvite stones in rat urinary tract. it also demonstrates that it can induce inflammatory changes in both bladder and kidney of rats without concomitant stone formation.

TI  == potencies of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime in a single chamber pharmacokinetic system simulating their in vivo half-lives.
AB  == ceftriaxone and cefotaxime are third-generation cephalosporins with similar in vitro potencies and spectra. however, previous studies have shown that ceftriaxone had superior in vivo activity (mouse pd50 values greater than or equal to 2-fold lower) compared to cefotaxime in 23 of 46 tested enterobacteriaceae. this superior activity was thought to be due to ceftriaxone's 5- to 8-fold longer half-life. the relationship between half-life (ceftriax-one 6 h, cefotaxime 1 h) and potency was examined by following bacterial kill curves in a single chamber, open-ended perfusion model over an 8-hour period. both antibiotics were compared for efficacy at both half-lives against four gram-negative bacteria. for two of the bacterial strains antibiotic potency differences in the perfusion model were determined largely by pharmacokinetics. for the other two strains intrinsic bacterial and antibiotic properties were of prime importance.

AB  == a direct antimicrobial susceptibility test and a direct identification of positive blood culture broths for gram-negative rods confirmed with gram stain by using a new instrument, cobas-bact, were compared with the conventional kirby-bauer agar diffusion disk method and with the in-house set of identification or api 20e, respectively. the bacterial pellet of centrifuged positive blood culture broth was used to inoculate a cobas-bact susceptibility and identification rotor. bacteria from 206 cases of monomicrobial septicemia due to members of the family enterobacteriaceae were tested. in 198 episodes (96%), direct identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing results were obtained for the same bacterial pathogen within 5 h of detection. of 204 direct identifications obtained, 177 (86.6%) were "high-confidence" correct identifications (percentage of likelihood [p] greater than or equal to 80%) and 25 (12.5%) "low-confidence" correct identifications (p less than 80%), whereas only 2 misidentifications occurred (1 escherichia coli and 1 proteus mirabilis).  direct susceptibility testing was performed in 199 episodes (96%), providing 1,885 antibiotic-microorganism combinations. full agreement reached 86.3%, and essential agreement reached 92.8%. minor discrepancies were found in 120 (6.5%) of the tests, major discrepancies were found in 127 (6.8%) tests, and very major  discrepancies were found in only 7 (0.4%) tests. subsequent mic determinations in cases of major or very major discrepancies reduced the number of major discrepancies involving cephalosporins from 60 to 16, whereas all those involving aminoglycosides remained. overall, this direct and rapid cobas-bact identification and susceptibility testing procedure offered accurate information  with 5 to 6 h after the laboratory detection of bacteremia and septicemia due to  members of the enterobacteriacease.

TI  == effects of the ph and the urine infected by escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis on chromic catgut, polyglycolic acid and polyglactin 910: study in vitro.
AB  == in order to study the effects of the ph and the urine infected by escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis on chromic catgut, polyglycolic acid (pga) and polyglactin 910 (p910), we divided the experiment into three steps. in the first  step, the behavior of suture material immersed in sterile urine, urine infected by e. coli and urine infected by p. mirabilis and in culture environment infected by p. mirabilis was studied. the physical features were observed continuously up  to the 6th day. in the second step, every element of the urea-splitting reaction  was isolatedly studied , without the presence of bacterial agents. and in the last step, that reaction was mimetized in sterile environments and in environments with acid and alkaline ph. while the chromic catgut was kept integral in all the environments, the pga and the p910 dissolved in urine infected by proteus, which was caused by the ammonia resulting from the urea-splitting reaction. this dissolution was also observed in sterile environment (mimetization of the urea-splitting reaction by urease, with no proteus). the destruction of the sutures was not influenced by the ph variance.

TI  == high resolution deuterium nmr studies of bacterial metabolism.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) is a preparation containing cpz and sbt, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. the antimicrobial activity of sbt/cpz was stronger than that of cpz alone. this increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of sbt was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and mic values. the mic80 of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of cpz alone was 50 micrograms/ml. mic80s of sbt/cpz against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of cpz, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. however, mic80s of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and  proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of cpz alone, and mic80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which  contained 30 micrograms of cpz and 30 micrograms of sbt. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate mic values. to interpret results of the showa sbt/cpz disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than mic  less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml  less than mic less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points  of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of s. aureus, e. faecalis, and p. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to mics. however, if different break points against p. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of  mics. antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == in this 31-site multicenter trial, 565 adult patients with urinary tract infections were randomly assigned to receive either a 10-day course of cefixime 400 mg once daily (n = 279) or amoxicillin 250 mg three times daily (n = 286). although all patients were included in the safety analysis, only 93 (33 percent)  cefixime-treated and 99 (35 percent) amoxicillin-treated patients were fully evaluable for the efficacy analysis. one week after therapy, the evaluable patients treated with cefixime demonstrated a 90 percent clinical cure rate and a 92 percent eradication rate of the baseline pathogen. this compared with an 83 percent clinical cure rate and an 84 percent bacterial eradication rate in the amoxicillin-treated group. the most frequently isolated pathogen was escherichia  coli (80 percent) followed by proteus mirabilis (10 percent). one hundred thirty-seven (49 percent) of the 279 cefixime-treated and 126 (44 percent) of the 286 amoxicillin-treated patients reported at least one adverse experience during  the study. adverse reactions associated with cefixime were similar to those reported for other beta-lactam antibiotics. the most frequent adverse experiences reported by cefixime-treated patients were diarrhea (15 percent) and stool changes (12 percent). headaches (11 percent) and diarrhea (9 percent) were the most frequently reported adverse reactions by the amoxicillin-treated patients. eleven cefixime-treated patients (3.9 percent) and 10 amoxicillin-treated patients (3.5 percent) discontinued therapy because of adverse experiences. results of this study demonstrate that a once-daily regimen of cefixime is as safe and effective as a three-times-daily regimen of amoxicillin in the treatment of acute urinary tract infections. although the incidence of bowel changes was somewhat higher in the cefixime treatment group, these events usually resolved when therapy was discontinued.

TI  == effect of circumcision status on periurethral bacterial flora during the first year of life.
AB  == to determine whether bacterial colonization is a factor in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection, we compared the periurethral bacterial flora of uncircumcised versus circumcised boys during the first year of life. intraurethral and circumferential glans cultures were obtained from 25 circumcised and 25 uncircumcised infants at 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months,  6 months, and 12 months of age. different children were used at each age (300 total). the types of bacteria and the total and specific colony counts were compared. the results of the glans cultures were similar to those from the urethra. uncircumcised boys had significantly higher total colony counts (p less  than 0.003) at all ages except 12 months. escherichia coli was present significantly more often (p less than 0.01) in the urethras of uncircumcised boys at 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. gram-negative uropathogenic organisms (klebsiella-enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were cultured more frequently (p less than 0.0005) from the urethras  of uncircumcised boys at 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. the specific colony counts for e. coli and the other uropathogenic organisms were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) at all ages except 12 months. we conclude that during the first 6 months of life, the presence of a foreskin is associated with a greater quantity of periurethral bacteria and a greater likelihood for the presence of, as well as higher concentrations of, potentially uropathogenic organisms.

TI  == recurrent gram-negative bacteremia.
AB  == purpose: recurrent gram-negative bacteremia is defined as two or more episodes of bacteremia occurring in the same patient with an infection-free interval between  each episode. our purpose was to identify patients with recurrent gram-negative bacteremia in order to define possible risk factors for its recurrence. patients  and methods: during a recently completed prospective study of all episodes of gram-negative bacteremia at the buffalo veterans administration center between april 1, 1984, and may 31, 1987, 35 patients with 74 episodes of gram-negative bacteremia were identified. the following information was obtained from all 35 patients: age, service, date of hospital admission, date of the bacteremia, underlying diseases, initial antimicrobial therapy, focus of infection, the presence or absence of shock, antimicrobial susceptibility of the blood isolate,  and outcome. results: all 35 patients were men, had a mean age of 69 years, and all had one or more underlying diseases; 45 percent had a malignancy. the duration of time between a pair of episodes was four weeks or more for 74 percent of 38 pairs of episodes. in 25 of 38 (66 percent) pairs of episodes, the focus of infection was the same; in 80 percent of these 25 pairs, the urinary tract was the focus. overall, the urinary tract was the focus of gram-negative bacteremia in almost 50 percent. escherichia coli was the single most common organism isolated (28 percent of all episodes), followed by proteus mirabilis (17.5 percent) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.5 percent). six of 35 (17 percent) patients died due to gram-negative bacteremia; five of these six had a respiratory tract focus of infection. conclusions: in a population of veterans, recurrent gram-negative bacteremia was identified in almost 10 percent of all patients with gram-negative bacteremia during a 37-month study period. recurrent  gram-negative bacteremia most frequently occurred in the setting of underlying malignancy with the urinary tract as a common focus of infection. the mortality rate of 17 percent was similar to that of all patients with gram-negative bacteremia reported in previous studies.

TI  == adherence of urease-induced crystals to rat bladder epithelium following acute infection with different uropathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == apart from urine supersaturation with respect to struvite and calcium phosphate,  crystal retention is considered to be necessary for the formation of infection stones. this study was performed to investigate the role of the mucous coat in rat bladders in the adhesion of sterile urease-induced crystals and to determine  to what extent the adhesion was influenced by infection. elimination of the mucous coat with 0.1 m hcl increased the adherence of crystals six times compared to that in bladders with an intact mucous coat. infection with proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, enterococci and ureaplasma urealyticum increased the adherence  six, five, four and two times, respectively. injury to the mucous coat may thus be one mechanism by which microorganisms can contribute to the formation of infection stones in the urinary tract.

TI  == in vitro activity of the combination trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole compared  with that of other chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  == for many years now, the combination trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole (active ingredients of bactrim) has proved to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, pneumococci, haemophilus influenza, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus  vulgaris, klebsiella, enterobacter and citrobacter. in this comparative study, the antibacterial activity of the combination against 2,229 gram-negative and 1,338 gram-positive strains encountered in domiciliary practice was tested and compared with that of other commonly used antimicrobials. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined in microtitre plates using serial dilutions. with regard to the gram-negative strains, trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole, with an mic90 of less than 2 mg/l for most isolates, was the most active substance apart from norfloxacin. the combination also had a powerful inhibitory effect on gram-positive strains, the mic90 being between 2 and 4 mg/l  for all strains except staphylococcus epidermidis.

TI  == proteus mirabilis urease: genetic organization, regulation, and expression of structural genes.
AB  == proteus mirabilis, a cause of serious urinary tract infection, produces urease, an important virulence factor for this species. the enzyme hydrolyzes urea to co2 and nh3, which initiates struvite or apatite stone formation. genes encoding urease were localized on a p. mirabilis chromosomal dna gene bank clone in escherichia coli by deletion analysis, subcloning, bal31 nuclease digestion, transposon tn5 mutagenesis, and in vitro transcription-translation. a region of dna between 4.0 and 5.4 kilobases (kb) in length was necessary for urease activity and was located within an 18.5-kb ecori fragment. the operon was induced by urea and encoded a multimeric, cytoplasmic enzyme comprising subunit polypeptides of 8,000, 10,000, and 73,000 daltons that were encoded by a single polycistronic mrna and transcribed in that order. seventeen urease-negative transposon insertions were isolated that synthesized either none of the structural subunit polypeptides, the 8,000-dalton polypeptide alone, or both the  8,000- and 10,000-dalton subunit polypeptides. the molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 212,000 by superose-6 chromatography. homologous sequences encoding the urease of providencia stuartii synthesized subunit polypeptides of similar sizes and showed a similar genetic arrangement. however,  restriction maps of the operons from the two species were distinct, indicating significant divergence.

TI  == production of a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance by genital flora bacteria.
AB  == bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter  calcoaceticus, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (amniostat-flm). all species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. the material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. the possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  == renal cyst infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease (pkd) is often unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy, in part because of the failure of most antibiotics to adequately penetrate cyst fluid. ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. to study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. the ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. the mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis.

AB  == the evolution of the prevalence of the bacterial strains isolated from uti cases  (bacteriuria greater than or equal to 10(5)/ml has been studied over a 11 year-period from 1976 to 1986, in a clinical practice microbiological laboratory  from a rural area. e. coli was the overall most frequently isolated species, followed by p. mirabilis (74.4% and 11.2% respectively), by the klebsiella-enterobacter group (4.8%), and staphylococci (represented by coagulase negative staphylococci) (4.9%). the relative frequency of the different species has been relatively stable year after year during the considered period. the evolution of the resistance to 4 antibiotics has been studied species by species  and year after year for the gram negative bacilli: a definite evolution towards resistance has been noted for ampicillin until 1985, followed by a decrease in 1986. the same tendency, although less pronounced, has been noted for cotrimoxazole. the frequency of the resistance to nalidixic acid has slightly increased from 1976 to 1986 (1.9% to 6.5%), as well as to pipemidic acid from (0% to 4%). the quinolones stand in 1987 as a good first line treatment of uti in community, and especially in rural areas, and the role of the clinical practice microbiological laboratory for the epidemiological surveillance has to be stressed.

TI  == activity of e-3846, a new fluoroquinolone, in vitro and in experimental cystitis  and pyelonephritis in rats.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of e-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. e-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. e-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis. in general, e-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics giving 90% inhibition for e-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. the activity of e-3846 increased at acid ph; in contrast, acid ph caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. in vivo, e-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental s. faecalis, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.

TI  == [current status of aminoglycoside resistance in hospital enterobacteriaceae].
AB  == we studied the susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae to four aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin et amikacin). we determined their phenotypes  of resistance by taking into account both the critic concentrations of the cfa (french committee for antibiogram) and the mic of the main susceptible population of each species. the most frequent phenotypes were gtnt, tnta and gtnta. amikacin resistance including phenotypes were essentially found in klebsiella and serratia (35% and 53% of the strains, respectively); with respect to amikacin, the phenotype expression may be insufficient to exceed the sensitive critic concentration of the cfa. amikacin resistant strains were isolated from chronically infected patients with devices, such as urinary catheters or tracheal cannula. these results suggest a strains or plasmids outbreak.

TI  == multiple proteins encoded within the urease gene complex of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == chromosomal dna fragments from a uropathogenic isolate of proteus mirabilis were  inserted into the cosmid vector phc79 to construct a genomic library in escherichia coli hb101. a urease-positive recombinant cosmid, designated pskw1, was recovered. sequential recombinant manipulation of pskw1 yielded a 10.2-kilobase plasmid, designated pskw4, which encoded three urease isozymes with electrophoretic mobilities identical to those of the donor p. mirabilis strain. plasmid pskw4 gene sequences encode seven proteins designated 68k (apparent molecular weight, of 68,000), 28k, 25k, 22.5k, 18.5k, 7.5k, and 5.2k within the limits of the urease gene complex. insertion mutations in genes encoding the 68k, 28k, 25k, 22.5k, 7.5k, and 5.2k proteins resulted in complete or partial (22.5k)  loss of urease activity. there was no reduction in urease activity when the gene  encoding the 18.5k protein was inactivated.

TI  == a survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  == ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. the efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the united states. data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. the unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. the  duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections  (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. in 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. after treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. of 411 isolates of p. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 escherichia coli and 80% of 248 staphylococcus aureus isolates. also eradicated were 95% of 166 klebsiella, 96% of 139 proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other proteus, 94% of 123 enterobacter, 100% of 68 haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 citrobacter, 89% of 45 serratia, 95% of 41 streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 salmonella, 100% of 38 morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 providencia isolates. adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. the most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated sgot, sgpt, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). crystalluria,  judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == treatment of experimental cystitis in the rat with a single dose of fosfomycin trometamol.
AB  == the therapeutic effectiveness of a single oral dose (60 and 200 mg/kg body weight) of fosfomycin trometamol (ft), norfloxacin, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (bactrim) and pipemidic acid against experimental cystitis in the rat were compared. infections were produced with clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli in a total of 135 sprague-dawley albino rats. oral treatment with all four drugs consistently lowered the numbers of cfu in bladder tissue, especially e. coli and p. mirabilis. fosfomycin trometamol appeared to be as effective as norfloxacin for treatment of e. coli cystitis even thoughs its minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) in vitro is 100 times greater than that of the quinolonic antibiotic. fosfomycin trometamol, pipemidic acid and bactrim were equally effective against  p. mirabilis infection, but ft was less active than norfloxacin or bactrim for treatment of k. pneumonia cystitis. in conclusion, single dose treatment with fosfomycin trometamol was effective for treatment of experimental cystitis in the rat and might, by extrapolation, be of use in clinical practice for single dose treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

TI  == role of intestinal anaerobic bacteria in colonization resistance.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the role of the intestinal anaerobe bacteria in colonization resistance. germfree mice were associated with escherichia coli c25 and either (a) no other species; (b) enterococcus; (c) escherichia coli m14 and proteus mirabilis, or (d) bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides vulgatus. all species colonized the cecum in high numbers, but only enterococcus significantly limited the translocation of escherichia coli c25 to mesenteric lymph nodes. however, the overall translocation rates were similar in  all groups and ranged from 60% to 100%, due to translocation of other intestinal  flora in addition to escherichia coli c25. conventionally reared mice were given  either streptomycin, bacitracin/streptomycin or metronidazole which selectively eliminated facultative gram-negative bacteria, nearly all bacterial species or strictly anaerobic bacteria respectively. only metronidazole significantly increased the rates of translocation of normal intestinal bacteria into mesenteric lymph nodes. cohort groups of mice were then orally inoculated with drug resistant escherichia coli c25, which actively colonized the cecum of all drug treated mice and translocated to the mesenteric lymph nodes of approximately half the streptomycin and metronidazole treated mice and nearly all the bacitracin/streptomycin treated mice. these results indicate that anaerobic bacteria play a pivotal role in limiting the translocation of normal intestinal bacteria, but that other bacterial groups also have a role in preventing the intestinal colonization and translocation of potential pathogens.

TI  == production and properties of haemolysins from clinical isolates of the proteeae.
AB  == a collection of 198 clinical isolates of strains belonging to the tribe proteeae  was examined for haemolytic activity on blood agar and in brain heart infusion broth. the strains were of diverse bacteriocin and o-antigenic types and from a wide variety of sources. they included representatives of all species of morganella, proteus and providencia. approximately half of the m. morgani strains were haemolytic on blood agar. this activity was not associated with any particular bacteriocin type. the haemolysin was also produced during exponential  growth in broth and was thermolabile and calcium dependent. all p. mirabilis strains and some p. vulgaris strains were non-haemolytic on blood agar. however,  most strains of the proteus spp., irrespective of their bacteriocin and antigenic type, produced, over a short period during exponential growth in broth, a heat-stable, cell-associated calcium-independent haemolysin. a smaller proportion of p. vulgaris and p. penneri strains produced, in addition, a thermolabile, calcium-dependent haemolysin which was associated with the formation of large haemolytic zones on blood agar. the relationship of these haemolysins to escherichia coli haemolysin and their possible role in virulence is discussed. haemolysin production was not found in any of the 74 strains of four species of providencia.

AB  == cyst infection in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd) is often refractory to therapy, in part because of the limited entry of commonly used antibiotics into cyst fluid. to study the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst infection, cyst fluid was obtained by percutaneous aspiration or at surgery from eight patients with adpkd receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient  by cyst-fluid sodium concentration. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole concentrations  within cysts were determined and cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers were assessed in vitro against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus fecalis. the mean cyst fluid trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole concentrations were 15.2 micrograms/ml and 42.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. preferential accumulation of trimethoprim was observed in gradient cysts, exceeding serum levels more than eightfold. sulfamethoxazole penetrated cysts to  a lesser extent, with concentrations ranging from 10 to 70 percent of the serum level. cyst fluid sampled prior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administration (control) demonstrated no antibacterial activity, while cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers following antibiotic administration were 1:32 or greater in most instances. these studies indicate that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is likely to be efficacious in the treatment of cyst infection in polycystic kidneys.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [the antimicrobial activity of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of sisomicin (siso) against clinical isolates obtained in the second half of 1986 were investigated together with other 4 aminoglycosides (ags) (gentamicin (gm), tobramycin (tob), dibekacin (dkb), amikacin (amk] and 2 cephems (cefotiam, cefotaxime), and were compared to the results reported in the period of late 1970's through early 1980's in japan. 1. the incidence of siso-resistant staphylococcus aureus in the present study was 18% and is comparable to that of the other studies suggesting that the incidence  of siso resistant strains remains on the stable level. the incidence of siso-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the tendency of slight increase. 2.  siso-resistant strains of enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and citrobacter  freundii did not show increase from the 1970/1980 levels. 3. isolation rates of siso-resistant indole(+) proteus varied depending on strains. isolation rates of  siso-resistant p. vulgaris and morganella morganii were both as low as 4%, but that of providencia rettgeri was as high as 60%. refering to an american study reporting that the genus providencia including p. rettgeri showed high incidence  of resistance to siso as well as to gm or tob, we pointed out that the antimicrobial activity of ags against genus providencia should be evaluated separately from those of other indole(+) proteus strains. 4. no siso-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae or p. mirabilis were found. 5. siso had good antimicrobial activity against most of the investigated species and siso may still be regarded as one of the clinically useful ags.

TI  == assessment of antiseptic bladder washout procedures using a physical model of the catheterised bladder.
AB  == a simple physical model of the catheterised bladder has been used to assess the activities of antiseptic agents that have been recommended as bladder instillations in the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. the activities of povidone-iodine, phenoxyethanol, chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine supplemented with edta + tris, noxythiolin and neomycin were examined against selected species of uropathogens. except for phenoxyethanol against pv. stuartii and possibly ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. however, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate ps. aeruginosa. it is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  == cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. it  inhibits the majority, 90%, of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes,  branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it inhibits 90% of the other members of the  enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and morganella morganii, cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, listeria, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. in general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.

AB  == the concentrations of pefloxacine and its n-demethylated derivative were measured in split ejaculates of 12 patients with chronic male accessory gland infection during treatment with 400 mg. pefloxacine twice a day. the mean concentrations of pefloxacine and n-demethylated pefloxacine (mg. per l.) were 8.7 +/- 1.2 (standard error of the mean) and 4.2 +/- 0.7 in fraction 1, and 9.8 +/- 1.1 and 4.3 +/- 0.6 in fraction 2. the concentrations in both fractions were correlated strongly (r equals 0.97). the concentration of pefloxacine in the secretory fluids of the prostate and seminal vesicles are 30-fold the minimal inhibitory concentration 90 of escherichia coli and klebsiella species, 100-fold the minimal inhibitory concentration 90 of proteus mirabilis and equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration 90 of streptococcus faecalis. in three-fourths of the patients signs of infection resolved after 4 weeks of treatment.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of sulbactam/cefoperazone. comparison with other new cephems].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) against 50 fresh clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared to those of  cpz, cefotiam (ctm), cefotaxime (ctx) and latamoxef (lmox). minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of sbt and cpz mixed in a ratio of 1:1 were determined by  the dilution method using mueller-hinton agar and expressed by absolute concentrations of cpz. antimicrobial activities of sbt/cpz against principally penicillinase (pcase) producing bacteria, i.e., s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, were superior to those of cpz alone. the presence of sbt in concentrations around 0.39 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml clearly enhanced cpz's antimicrobial activities against these pcase producing strains. the synergistic antimicrobial effects of sbt in combination with cpz were less pronounced against principally cephalosporinase (cepase) producing bacteria, i.e., c. freundii, enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris, and p. aeruginosa, and exerted with sbt at concentrations around 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml. comparative antimicrobial activities indicated by mic80's of tested agents showed that sbt/cpz had more stable activities against bacteria ranging from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria than ctm, ctx and lmox. mic's of sbt/cpz were higher than 25 micrograms/ml against 8% of s. aureus, 18% of c. freundii, 10% of enterobacter spp., 26% of s. marcescens, 2% of p. vulgaris, and 18% of p. aeruginosa. these resistant strains against which the addition of sbt showed no synergism, may possess other mechanism of resistance than beta-lactamase production. it is concluded that the presence of cpz resistant strains is an actual current problem and not an imaginary future problem, and that the number of resistant strains against other new cephems which have different chemical structure from cpz is increasing. when these present bacteriological environments are considered, the appearance of sbt/cpz in the clinical practice is timely and meaningful.

TI  == endotoxin provocation of experimental renal cystic disease.
AB  == germ free rats provide a unique model in which to assess biological response to environment. in 48 germ-free male, sprague-dawley rats we examined the consequences of oral exposure to nordihydroguaiaretic acid (ndga), a nephrotoxin; to staphylococcus epidermidis and bacillus species, non-endotoxin-containing bacteria; to escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, endotoxin-containing bacteria; and injected e. coli endotoxin on peripheral leukocyte counts and renal morphology. morphological changes were evaluated by light microscopy and scored blindly on a 0 to 4+ scale for 15 parameters of renal structure. means of these renal "pathology scores" correlated with counts of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. the highest counts and scores were found in rats given ndga and exposed to endotoxin, either by injection or by oral feeding of endotoxin-containing bacteria. counts and scores were lower in the absence of endotoxin and with non-endotoxin-containing bacteria, given alone or in combination with either ndga or endotoxin. results exclude bacterial colonization and intrarenal accumulation of ndga as causes of nephropathy. they indicate that endotoxin and ndga act synergistically to provoke renal damage in the germ free ndga-fed rat and suggest that leukocytes are involved in the process.

TI  == gentamicin resistance among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates in a hospital  with long-term use of gentamicin.
AB  == between 1977 and 1985, gentamicin was the only formulary aminoglycoside at the buffalo veterans administration medical center. during this time, there was a significant increase in the amount of gentamicin purchased. amikacin represented  11% or less of the total aminoglycoside purchased in the same period, but purchases of this agent also significantly increased. because of this long-term use of gentamicin, a retrospective analysis of gentamicin resistance among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates was performed. the results of this review  revealed no significant change in the overall incidence of gram-negative bacteremia; approximately 75% of these bacteremic episodes were hospital acquired. the mean yearly gentamicin-resistance rate of gram-negative blood isolates was 13.2% (range, 6% to 18%) with no significant change in the rate for  the period reviewed. however, for certain strains there were fluctuations in the  percentage of resistance from year to year, suggesting that clusters of infections due to these organisms had occurred. bacteremic infection due to resistant organisms was a major contributor to the overall level of gentamicin resistance among blood isolates. amikacin resistance among gram-negative blood isolates was rare. in conclusion, despite the predominant use of gentamicin there was no change in the gentamicin resistance rate among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates during a nine-year period. the rate of gentamicin resistance among blood isolates appeared to be related to outbreaks/clusters of infections due to  resistant strains rather than the frequency of use of gentamicin.

TI  == cephalosporin, carbapenem, and monobactam antibiotics.
AB  == cephalosporin and related antibiotics are highly effective bactericidal agents of relatively low toxicity. the spectrum of activity varies with the drug but is usually broad. the first-generation cephalosporins, and especially cefazolin, are most active against sensitive staphylococci and streptococci. most second-generation (except cefoxitin) and third-generation cephalosporins show substantial activity against haemophilus influenzae. all cephalosporins (except cefsulodin) are active against klebsiella, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis, whereas only the third-generation agents have pronounced activity against the other enterobacteriaceae. imipenem (a carbapenem) is active against essentially all pathogenic organisms, but aztreonam (a monobactam) is active against only aerobic gram-negative bacilli. advantages associated with some of the new cephalosporins are once-daily administration and high cerebrospinal fluid levels. with the development of new cephalosporins, however, new toxicities have  become apparent, and superinfections and induction of resistance have become greater problems. the cephalosporins are among the most expensive antibiotics in  use today; thus, use of these expensive agents must be justified by lower toxicity, greater efficacy, or both in comparison with drugs of more reasonable cost.

TI  == the penicillins.
AB  == the penicillin family of antibiotics is ever expanding and remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. these medications generally have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity,  and efficacy against infections due to susceptible organisms. the clinical introduction of aqueous penicillin g for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an important pharmacologic landmark. the emergence  of penicillinase-producing staphylococci prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, oxacillin, nafcillin, and others), in which the acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactamase  ring. the aminopenicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin, and others) were later developed because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. their spectrum included escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella, salmonella, listeria, and haemophilus. the search for a penicillin with even further antimicrobial activity against the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa  led to the development of the carboxypenicillins, ureidopenicillins, and piperazine penicillins. recently, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid or sulbactam) and an amino-penicillin or ticarcillin has resulted in further extension of their antibacterial spectra. the development of  an ideal penicillin that is nonsensitizing, bioavailable, beta-lactamase-resistant, rapidly bactericidal, nontoxic, and inexpensive and that has high affinity to penicillin-binding proteins and no inoculum effect remains the goal.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == post-antibiotic suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the post-antibiotic suppressive effect (pae) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a pae against gram-negative bacteria. in this study, the paes of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus faecalis were determined. the differences in pae determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for s. aureus and e. coli. ciprofloxacin had a pae by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. a ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in mueller-hinton broth, ph 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a pae of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for s. aureus, but had no effect on s. faecalis. exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour pae for e. coli, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae. use of mueller-hinton broth with a  magnesium concentration of 8 mm, ph 5.5, yielded similar results. using human serum, a four-hour pae was found for p. aeruginosa. there was a progressive increase in the pae as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from  0.9 hours to three hours. increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to  eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for p. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the mbc for e. coli did not cause a significant difference  in the pae using a two-hour exposure. overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent pae for most gram-negative bacteria and for s. aureus, but not for s. faecalis. a pae caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the ph adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. these results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment  of tissue and urinary infections.

TI  == use of intravenous ciprofloxacin in difficult-to-treat infections.
AB  == intravenous ciprofloxacin was administered to 54 patients who were either critically ill or in whom oral administration was not possible. the 31 males and  23 females ranged in age from 20 to 89 years (mean, 53.2 +/- 17.8 years). patients had "difficult-to-treat" infections, i.e., respiratory infections (15),  abscesses (four intraabdominal, three lung, two soft tissue, and one intrahepatic), deep soft tissue infections (10), chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (nine), upper urinary tract infection (five), malignant external otitis (two), catheter-related bacteremia (two), and infectious endocarditis (one). thirty patients (56 percent) had serious associated medical problems. pathogens included pseudomonas aeruginosa (38 isolates), acinetobacter species (10 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (eight isolates), escherichia coli (two isolates), proteus mirabilis (one isolate), kingella kingae (one isolate), bacteroides fragilis (eight isolates), and peptostreptococcus species (five isolates). minimal inhibitory concentrations of  ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.003 to 2 micrograms/ml. in 39 patients, the isolated  microorganisms were multi-resistant; resistance included ceftazidime and amikacin in 32 patients. in 24 patients, ciprofloxacin was given exclusively by the intravenous route at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours; in 30 patients, treatment was completed after discontinuation of the parenteral drug with the oral preparation of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg every 12 hours. the duration of  parenteral treatment ranged from six to 40 days (mean, 14.9 days). a successful clinical response was observed in 49 patients (91 percent), while five (9 percent) failed to show a response. bacteriologic outcomes were as follows: eradication of pathogen in 33 patients (61.1 percent), persistence in 18 (33.3 percent), and relapse in three (5.6 percent), with development of resistance to ciprofloxacin in nine patients (16.7 percent) and superinfection in two patients  (3.7 percent). side effects included vein irritation at the site of the infusion  (three patients), abnormal elevation in liver enzyme levels (two patients), reversible renal failure (one patient), and nausea (one patient). parenteral ciprofloxacin is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective therapy for the critically ill patient, and can be replaced with the oral form when clinically appropriate.

TI  == clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin therapy for gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis.
AB  == the efficacy and toxicity of ciprofloxacin, an orally administered fluoroquinolone, were evaluated in 24 infections in 23 patients with osteomyelitis caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli. the diagnosis was confirmed by surgical findings and the results of bone biopsy and culture of bone or deep soft tissue. the aerobic gram-negative bacilli were pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 isolates), serratia marcescens (five isolates), escherichia coli (three isolates), enterobacter species (three isolates), proteus mirabilis (one isolate), pseudomonas fluorescens (one isolate), and klebsiella pneumoniae (one isolate). minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were 1.56 micrograms/ml or less for all but one isolate. nine infections were polymicrobial, involving aerobic gram-positive cocci or anaerobes in addition to aerobic gram-negative bacilli. additional antibiotics to which the aerobic gram-negative bacilli were resistant were given when the additional organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin. patients received 750 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily for a mean of 62 days. peak serum levels of ciprofloxacin were at least threefold higher than the mbcs in 20 of 24 patients. twenty of 22 infections in which a full course of therapy was completed were without evidence of active disease at one to 17 months posttreatment. a sternotomy wound infection relapsed after eight weeks  of therapy with a newly resistant s. marcescens strain, and an infection of a compound fracture relapsed two months posttreatment with a still sensitive p. aeruginosa strain. toxicity was minimal in most patients: eosinophilia (six patients), nausea (eight patients), mild elevation in transaminase levels (three  patients), pruritus (one patient), diarrhea (two patients), thrush (two patients), rash (two patients), and mild leukopenia (one patient). two additional patients had severe side effects (vertigo in one and acute renal failure in another) that required discontinuation of ciprofloxacin therapy. overall, ciprofloxacin is a promising agent for the oral treatment of gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis.

TI  == comparative, double-blind study of oral ciprofloxacin and intravenous cefotaxime  in skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == the effectiveness and safety of orally administered ciprofloxacin and intravenously administered cefotaxime were compared in a double-blind study of 60 men with infections of skin and soft tissue, including cellulitis, ulcers, abscesses, cellulitis with ulcers or abscesses, wound infections, and post-traumatic infections. patients in the ciprofloxacin group received 750 mg orally every 12 hours for a mean duration of 9.6 days (six to 18 days), and those in the cefotaxime group received 2.0 g intravenously every eight hours for a mean duration of 9.3 days (five to 14 days). infection was documented bacteriologically in 78 percent of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and in 83 percent of the patients in the cefotaxime group. pathogens included staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, group b streptococci, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella and pseudomonas species. half of the infections were mixed infections. ninety percent (19 of 21) of the infections were bacteriologically eradicated with ciprofloxacin, and 82 percent (18 of 22) were eradicated with cefotaxime. treatment was completely successful in 79 percent (22 of 28) of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and in 68 percent (19 of 28) in the cefotaxime group (p greater than 0.1). the side effects in both treatment groups were comparable. this study demonstrates that orally administered ciprofloxacin is comparable in effectiveness and safety to cefotaxime administered intravenously in the treatment of infections of skin and soft tissue, and that it can offer an alternative in the treatment of such infections.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzoname in the pediatric field].
AB  == cefuzoname (czon) one of the aminothiazolyloxyiminoacetamido cephalosporins, was  studied for its antibacterial activity, absorption and excretion, concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and the penetration, and clinical efficacy. the  following are a summary of the results: 1. antibacterial activity; the antibacterial activity of czon was studied on clinically isolated staphylococcus  aureus (cefazolin (cez)-susceptible and cez-tolerant strains), escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis. compared with czon were cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone, cefmetazol (cmz), cefotiam and cez, but for s. aureus cefamandole (cmd) was replaced for cpz. activities of czon against  s. aureus, both cez-susceptible and cez-tolerant strains, were superior to those  of 6 control drugs. the distribution of mics for the cez-susceptible strains was  0.10-12.5 micrograms/ml, and for the cez-tolerant strains 0.20-greater than 100 micrograms/ml. mic peaks were 0.39 micrograms/ml and 0.78-1.56 micrograms/ml for  cez-susceptible and cez-tolerant strains, respectively. against both susceptible  and tolerant strains, czon showed superiority to cmz and cmd, which are used prevalently and used for methicillin-resistant s. aureus also. distributions of mics of czon (and the peak of mics) on e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis were less than or equal to 0.025-1.56 (less than or equal to 0.025), less than or equal to 0.025-25 (less than or equal to 0.025-0.05), less than or equal to 0.025-25 (less than or equal to 0.025) micrograms/ml, respectively, showing czon's similar antibacterial activity to those of cephalosporins, cmx and lmox, which are 5th group. 2. absorption and excretion: eight patients, aged 10 months  to 15 years, were administered with czon 20 mg/kg, one shot intravenously. serum  concentrations somewhat varied from patient to patient, but the mean value was 48.7 micrograms/ml after 30 minutes of administration which decreased rapidly to  13.3 micrograms/ml after 1 hour, to 3.4 micrograms/ml after 2 hours, to 1.14 micrograms/ml after 4 hours, and to 0.15 microgram/ml after 6 hours. half-lives were 0.67-1.47 hours, with the mean of 0.87 hour. urinary recovery rates were 24.7-55.9%, with the mean of 45.1%, in 6 hours after administration. 3. csf concentration and penetration rate: to 4 pediatric patients with purulent meningitis, czon 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg was administered and the concentration in csf was measured.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [recent trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in japan (1979-1984). part 4. a classification of prognosis and antibiotic treatment based on causative agents].
AB  == nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. the number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (ags) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-ags antibiotics including beta-lactam (non ags) was observed. a trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (cfr) was  observed except that cfr for gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + ags remained at a same level. cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. cases with staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, cfr was 28.6%  (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + ags and 37.5% (3/8) with  beta-lactam + non ags (p less than 0.1). among 100 cases of group b streptococcus (gbs), cfr was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + ags (p less than 0.1). among 198 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae, cfr was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. cfr for the cases treated with beta-lactam + ags was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + non ags was 3.6% (1/28) (p less than 0.1). cfr for 292 cases of haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + ags and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam  + non ags, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. among 111 cases of escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + non ags gave 6.5% (2/31) cfr, and 5.6% (1/18) cfr, respectively, whereas beta-lactam  + ags showed cfr of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (p less than 0.1). similar tendencies were observed in the cases of listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. contrary to the high cfr observed with the beta-lactam + ags treatment, significantly low cfr was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. infections with gbs, e. coli, and p. mirabilis  occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and cfr was especially high in  the very young.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == distribution of cefodizime to exudate in the croton oil-induced rat granuloma pouch and its therapeutic effects on experimental infections in the pouch.
AB  == cefodizime was compared with cefotaxime (ctx) in regard to its distribution to an inflammatory site (exudate in croton oil-induced granuloma pouch) of rats and its therapeutic effects on experimental infections in such pouches after intravenous  injection. cefodizime levels in rat serum and pouch exudate were higher than those of ctx, and the former compound disappeared from the serum and pouch exudate far more slowly than the latter. in the tests for therapeutic effects, cefodizime showed almost the same degree of inhibitory activity as ctx against growth in pouch exudate of escherichia coli ec-7, proteus mirabilis pm-428, and serratia marcescens sm-390 for which the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefodizime were equal to or greater than the ctx values, and such activity of  cefodizime lasted for a longer period than that of ctx. these results suggest that the above pharmacokinetic features of cefodizime compensate for its mics against organisms displaying lower values for ctx.

TI  == adherence of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis to human transitional cells.
AB  == this study utilizes a light microscopy assay for bacterial adherence to human male transitional cells. prior light microscopy studies have used voided squamous cells, periurethral cells or scraped vaginal cells, which are less representative of the cells lining the majority of the urinary tract. using a modification of previous bacterial adherence assays, the mean adherence for 28 strains of e. coli in 92 bacteria-cell incubations was 10.2 +/- 11.5 (standard deviation) bacteria per cell. the mean adherence for 20 strains of p. mirabilis in 60 bacteria cell incubations was 8.1 +/- 11.4. no statistically significant difference in adherence between e. coli and p. mirabilis was found (p greater than 0.05). studies comparing the adherence of e. coli isolated from the urine of patients with pyelonephritis (eight strains), cystitis (10 strains) and anal swabs of females without urinary tract infections (10 strains), showed no statistically significant differences in mean adherence (p greater than 0.05). however, there was a trend toward higher adherence in the more virulent groups. experiments comparing the adherence of p. mirabilis isolated from infected renal stones to p. mirabilis isolated from anal swabs of female patients without history of p. mirabilis uti revealed no statistically significant differences in mean adherence between the two groups (p greater than 0.05). these data do not support previous  contentions that p. mirabilis adhere poorly to human transitional cells. the absence of a significant difference in adherence among strains of e. coli and p.  mirabilis that differ in clinical pathogenicity suggests that factors other than  adherence contribute to their virulence.

TI  == the secreted hemolysins of proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii are genetically related to each other and to the alpha-hemolysin of escherichia coli.
AB  == secreted hemolysins were extremely common among clinical isolates of proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, and hemolytic activity was  either cell associated or cell free. southern hybridization of total dna from hemolytic isolates to cloned regions of the escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin (hly) determinant showed clear but incomplete homology between genes encoding production of hemolysins in the four species. one of the two e. coli secretion genes, hlyd, hybridized only with dna from p. vulgaris and m. morganii, which produced cell-free hemolysis, but not with that from p. mirabilis, which showed only cell-associated activity. molecular cloning of the genetic determinants of cell-free hemolytic activity from p. vulgaris and m. morganii chromosomal dna allowed their functional analysis via inactivation with the transposons tn1000 and tn5. both hemolysin determinants were about 7.5 kilobase pairs and comprised  contiguous regions directing regulation, synthesis, and specific secretion out of the cell. transposon mutations which eliminated secretion of the proteus and morganella hemolysins could be complemented specifically by the e. coli hemolysin secretion genes hlyb or hlyd. alignment of the physically and functionally defined hly determinants from p. vulgaris and m. morganii with that of the e. coli alpha-hemolysin confirmed a close genetic relationship but also indicated extensive evolutionary divergence.

TI  == [etiology of corneal ulcers with special reference to bacterial genesis].
AB  == the authors report on 134 patients (141 eyes) seen between may 1982 and december  1985 with corneal ulcers with or without hypopyon. eight patients (11 eyes) had a facial palsy, 7 (7 eyes) a varicella zoster infection, 1 (2 eyes) a marginal ulcer ("furrow keratitis") associated with collagenosis, 29 (29 eyes) an ulcerative keratitis with endophthalmitis, 1 (2 eyes) a pemphigoid-associated ulcer and 90 (92 eyes) a herpetic infection. pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated from 20 patients: 10 coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus (4 coinfections), 3 pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 coinfection), 2 proteus mirabilis (1 coinfection), 2 escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and beta-hemolyzing streptococci as well as enterococci in one case each, and non-hemolyzing streptococci and alpha-hemolyzing streptococci in two cases each as coinfections. a comparison of the range of bacterial strains of postoperative  endophthalmitis and kerato-/conjunctivitis with bacterial corneal ulcers revealed a high percentage of gram-negative organisms in the latter. laboratory work-up should include microscopy, agar plating and differentiation as well as antibiotic sensitivity testing and modern immunofluorescent direct techniques. management includes bactericidal topical and systemic antibiotic regimens as well as surgical procedures if necessary, e.g., perforating tectonic and mini-keratoplasty, and conjunctival flapping followed by lamellar keratoplasty.

TI  == in-vitro bacterial killing kinetics of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid.
AB  == an in-vitro model was developed to study the rates of killing by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combinations of various beta-lactamase producing, ticarcillin resistant, logarithmic phase clinical isolates. killing, defined as a 3 log reduction, was dependent on the organism, the concentration of clavulanic acid and the duration of exposure. for most isolates studied an optimum period of exposure to and concentration of clavulanic acid could be defined. certain test strains showed optimum response to readily attainable in-vivo concentrations of clavulanic acid while other strains, although sensitive by mic data showed a poor response. the clinical implications of this are discussed.

TI  == in-vitro anti-microbial susceptibility of clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria to ten antibiotics including phosphomycin.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ten antibiotics was determined for  various bacterial pathogens isolated from clinical specimens in a lagos hospital. the in-vitro activity of penicillin and tetracycline was not very impressive and  a similarity was noticed in the resistance patterns of these two antibiotics, while the activity in vitro of the relatively more toxic aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol was high for gram-negative rods. ceftazidime demonstrated the highest activity in vitro against all pathogens studied. cefoxitin, cefuroxime and phosphomycin demonstrated an impressive activity in vitro. clindamycin was very active against strains of staphylococcus aureus. beta-lactamase production amongst these strains was studied and the clinical significance of this and their mic results are discussed.

TI  == identification of porins in outer membrane of proteus, morganella, and providencia spp. and their role in outer membrane permeation of beta-lactams.
AB  == proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, and providencia alcalifaciens, which were once classified into the same genus, proteus, were studied. cefoxitin-resistant mutants from these species were isolated, and it was confirmed that the resistance was attributed to the lack of  an outer membrane protein, resulting in a significant decrease in the penetration of hydrophilic cephalosporins through the outer membrane. comparison of the mutant strains with their parental strains in the diffusion rates of six monoanionic cephalosporins, a zwitterionic cephalosporin (cephaloridine), and a divalent anionic cephalosporin (cephalosporin c) suggested that each species had  only one kind of porin protein, with molecular weights of 40,000 (proteus mirabilis) or 37,000 (the other four species) and that the porins formed channels with cation selectivity, except for proteus vulgaris. porin proteins were purified from all the bacterial species except providencia alcalifaciens, and the radius of the pores formed by the purified porins was estimated by the use of the liposome swelling assay. the pore radii were estimated to be approximately 0.59 nm (proteus mirabilis), 0.63 nm (proteus vulgaris), 0.58 nm (providencia rettgeri), and 0.60 nm (m. morganii), similar to the size of the pore radius of escherichia coli porins.

TI  == roles of antibody and complement in the bactericidal activity of mouse peritoneal exudate neutrophils.
AB  == the contributions of complement and antibody to phagocytosis and, as a separate process, intracellular killing of proteus mirabilis, were investigated using mouse peritoneal exudate neutrophils. phagocytosis of p. mirabilis was promoted by both immune mouse (ims) and normal mouse (nms) sera. opsonization by ims promoted significantly greater phagocytosis than did nms, as did nms compared with heated ims (hims). the ability of nms to opsonize p. mirabilis for both phagocytosis and phagocytic killing was diminished by chelation with egta and abolished by chelation with edta. this suggested that fixation of complement by both alternative and classical pathways provided optimal opsonization of this organism in nms. in order to study intracellular killing as a process separate from phagocytosis, peritoneal exudate cell suspensions were exposed to p. mirabilis, previously incubated with 1% nms, 1% ims, 10% hnms (heated normal mouse serum) or 10% hims, followed by centrifugation of the phagocyte-bacteria mixtures on percoll density gradients. populations of neutrophils containing viable intracellular bacteria, and relatively free of extracellular bacteria (less than 7% of total) were recovered in washed suspensions of cells fractionated at densities greater than 1.069 g/ml. for p. mirabilis that had been opsonized with 1% nms before phagocytosis, the continued presence of extracellular serum was necessary for intracellular killing. nms stimulated significantly greater intracellular killing than did hnms, which stimulated some  intracellular killing compared with the absence of serum, in which no killing occurred. ims was similar to nms in its ability to stimulate intracellular killing. egta partially blocked the stimulation of intracellular killing by nms,  and edta abolished it. these findings suggested that (as for optimal opsonization) complement activated via both alternative and classical pathways was responsible for optimal stimulation of intracellular killing.

TI  == cloning of genes from members of the family enterobacteriaceae with mini-mu bacteriophage containing plasmid replicons.
AB  == an in vivo cloning system that uses derivatives of the escherichia coli bacteriophage mu with plasmid replicons has been extended to five different species of the family enterobacteriaceae. mu and these mini-mu replicon elements  were introduced into strains of e. coli, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, and proteus mirabilis by infection, by transformation, or by conjugation with newly constructed broad-host-range plasmids containing insertions of these elements. lysates from these cells, lysogenic for mu and mini-mu elements, were used to infect sensitive recipient strains of e. coli, s. typhimurium, and c. freundii. drug-resistant transductants had mini-mu replicon elements with inserts of different dna sequences. all of the lysogens made could be induced to yield high phage titers, including those coming from strains that were resistant to mu and mu derivatives. clones of 10 particular genes were isolated by their ability to complement specific mutations  in the recipient strains, even in the presence of the e. coli k-12 restriction system. some of the mini-mu replicon elements used contained lac gene fusing segments and resulted in fusions of the lac operon to control regions in the cloned sequences.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. observation from mic and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of ceftizoxime (czx) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. czx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 0.20 microgram/ml. it was also active against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes with mic85 of  3.13 micrograms/ml. czx was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml.  czx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the  reliability of czx disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter  discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of czx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the czx disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of czx, except against p. aeruginosa and e.  faecalis. for the interpretation of czx disc tests, a 3 category system has been  used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (ms) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == [treatment of urinary tract infections with solcourovac].
AB  == urinary tract infections are among the most common infections found in women. if  recurrences or reinfections become frequent treatment can be problematic. immunisation of the patients by vaccinating them against urinary tract pathogens  offers a possibility of managing these infections. in clinical trials we tested solcourovac, a new vaccine to counteract bacterial pathogens, with regard to efficacy, frequency of recurrence, and tolerance. 113 of the 118 patients included in this study with bacteriuria (urine culture germ count greater than or equal to 10(5)/ml), had acute cystitis. 47 of these patients had recurring urinary tract infections. follow-up examinations were conducted after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 months. a urine culture assay was performed during each examination, as  well as a relevant bacterial differentiation test and a urine sediment evaluation. two to six weeks after termination of the vaccination series 72.6% of the patients were largely free from signs and symptoms. the rate of recurrence/reinfection dropped from 2.5 to 0.24 infections for a period of 12 months. after one year, 94 of the patients (80%) were still free from reinfection.

TI  == n-nitrosamine formation in urinary-tract infections.
AB  == urine samples from 31 patients with urinary-tract infections and from 31 controls were analysed for volatile nitrosamines, n-nitrosamino acids, total n-nitroso compounds as a group, and nitrite/nitrate. the concentration of n-nitrosodimethylamine was significantly elevated in urines infected with escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. the levels of nitrite, n-nitrosoproline and total n-nitroso compounds, when expressed as the amount per mol creatinine, were also significantly increased in patients with bacteriuria. several bacterial strains were capable of catalysing nitrosation of  morpholine at neutral ph. these results suggest that n-nitroso compounds can be formed in vivo in the infected bladder, which could explain the association between urinary-tract infections and increased risk for bladder cancer.

TI  == [urinary tract infections in children. status in a pediatric hospital and sensitivity of bacterial strains to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid combination].
AB  == three hundred bacterial strains from positive urine cultures were isolated over a 10 months period in paediatric hospitalized and out-patients. in addition to commonly used antibiotics, each strain was tested for amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (augmentin, beecham) susceptibility. this antibiotic, which is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta lactamases, may be of interest in the treatment of urinary tract infections because of its pharmacokinetics and activity. the antibacterial  activity of amoxycillin and augmentin against enterobacteriaceae with special reference to escherichia coli was compared. the resistance phenotype of enterobacteriaceae to amoxycillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin allows to anticipate the nature of the beta-lactamase produced by a particular strain, and  infer the activity of augmentin. the overall activity of augmentin should be interpreted taking into account the resistance phenotypes. in our study, augmentin was active against 90% of e. coli strains, almost all proteus mirabilis and vulgaris strains but 9 out of 24 klebsiella strains were resistant. augmentin had no activity against nosocomial enterobacteriaceae, nor against pseudomonas aeruginosa. on the other hand, its activity was of interest against penicillinase producing staphylococcus. our results confirm the interest of augmentin as a preferential treatment of urinary tract infections in children.

AB  == the effect of fosfomycin trometamol in comparison with that of norfloxacin and co-trimoxazole on the hemagglutination, yeast cell aggregation and adhesive properties of both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms was studied. the strains were isolated from the urine of patients with urinary tract infections, or from vaginal swabs. at sublethal concentrations (1/4 and 1/8 of the minimal inhibitory concentration), the ability of the bacteria to adhere to human uroepithelial cells was reduced by any of the 3 drugs assayed. the reduction corresponded to a decrease in the agglutinating activity of the gram-negative bacteria tested, such providing further evidence for the efficacy of the different chemoantibiotics. in particular, fosfomycin trometamol and norfloxacin proved to be more effective than co-trimoxazole in affecting the adhesive properties of all the strains employed.

AB  == 6315-s, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. it inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-s did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, or enterobacter cloacae (mics for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. pseudomonas species and acinetobacter species were resistant (mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml). mics for 90% of the staphylococcus aureus and s.  epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-s was highly active against anaerobic species of clostridium, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-s was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  == 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. the bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, e. agglomerans, e. cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozanae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, p. rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, citrobacter diversus, c. freundii, morganella morganii, serratia liquefaciens, s. marcescens, hafnia alvei, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. cepacia, p. maltophila, p. fluorescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, lancefield group a, b and d streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and bacillus species. in vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. of the 819 strains of enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. ninety-seven percent strains of p. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. all the 161 isolates of s. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. all gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of s. epidermidis and 5% isolates of s. agalactiae.

TI  == comparison of cefixime and co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection. a double-blind general practice study.
AB  == five hundred and twenty-eight patients with presumptive acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uti) were randomly assigned to receive cefixime 400 mg once daily, cefixime 200 mg twice daily or co-trimoxazole 2 tablets twice a day for 10 days; 477 completed at least 5 days of therapy. of the patients 342 (65%)  had positive baseline urine cultures, yielding 353 pathogens. a microbiological response was determined for 280 pathogens (79%), eradication being observed in over 94% of isolates; 153 pathogens (43%) were sensitive to both cefixime and co-trimoxazole and eradication was observed in over 96% of cases. clinical response correlated well with microbiological response. the incidence of diarrhoea and stool changes was higher (p less than 0.005) in the patients who received cefixime once daily than in the other groups. there was a significantly  higher incidence of stool changes with cefixime twice daily than with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.05), but these did not necessitate discontinuation  of therapy. nausea was commoner with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.05). the majority of pathogens isolated were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococci. approximately 24% of e. coli were resistant in vitro to co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.005). cefixime 200 mg twice daily is an effective and safe alternative to co-trimoxazole in the management of acute uncomplicated uti.

AB  == the clinical efficacy and safety of aztreonam were studied in 30 patients suffering from urinary tract infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. aztreonam was given in a dose of 1 g i.m. at intervals of 12 or 24 hours. duration of therapy was 2-8 days. bacteria isolated in urine cultures were: escherichia coli (60%); proteus mirabilis (10%); pseudomonas aeruginosa and citrobacter sp. (7%); proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens; klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas species (3%). at completion of therapy and at follow-up all patients were bacteriologically and clinically cured. no significant side effects or toxicity were observed in all patients treated. it is concluded from these data that aztreonam is highly effective and well tolerated in patients affected either by upper or lower urinary tract infections.

AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the  standard method of the japanese congress of chemotherapy. the results obtained are summarized below. cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against enterococcus sp., b. fragilis and s. marcescens. s. pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against citrobacter sp. and e. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against h. influenzae and indole positive proteus group. cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against p. aeruginosa. resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among staphylococcus sp., while the mics of other antibiotics against staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing  because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.

AB  == purification of a bactericidal protein (bp) from the cytoplasmic granules of normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) with activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa is described. bactericidal activity from acid extracts of a mixed granule population was purified 175-fold by a two-step chromatographic procedure. the first step, dye-ligand affinity chromatography with matrex-gel orange a, was  followed by cation-exchange chromatography with bio-rex 70 resin, and this combination routinely gave a yield near 80%. only one peak of bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa type i was found after each chromatographic step.  characterization of bp showed a single band with an apparent molecular weight of  55,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. purified bp  was most active against the six strains of p. aeruginosa tested and against escherichia coli b (a deep rough mutant). purified bp killed 5 x 10(6) cfu of p.  aeruginosa type i per ml at a concentration of 60 to 80 ng/ml. proteus mirabilis  and staphylococcus aureus were both resistant to the bactericidal activity of bp. bp was shown to be glycosylated by periodic acid staining after gel electrophoresis and to have an isoelectric point near 7.5 by chromatofocusing. the amino acid composition of bp is presented.

TI  == comparative study of some biological activities of porins extracted from various  microorganisms.
AB  == the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria contains some major proteins, called porins, with particular chemical and physical characteristics which reflect some  specialized functions peculiar to the outer membrane. in recent years the biological properties of salmonella typhimurium sh5014 porins have been the focus of our experimental studies. the aim of the present research was to make a comparative investigation of the biological activities of porins extracted from other microorganisms classified in the enterobacteriaceae, together with a taxonomically different one, eikenella corrodens frequently isolated from gum pockets of patients with periodontal disease. porins from e. coli k12, proteus mirabilis and eikenella corrodens were extracted, purified and separated from lps by means of phenol extraction. the purity of preparation was checked by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in slabs. we studied the interactions of these proteins with some cellular and humoral systems within the  host. mouse peritoneal macrophages in the presence of these proteins show morphological and functional modifications, depending upon the type of porins and the concentrations used. the ability of porins to interact with the complement system was investigated in vitro. a pool of sera from 20 blood donors served as a source of human complement. the results obtained with porins of various sources were shown comparatively.

TI  == identification and characterization of a uroepithelial cell adhesin from a uropathogenic isolate of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == proteus mirabilis is a frequent cause of urinary tract infections in rehabilitation hospitals and among persons with structural abnormalities of the urinary tract. adherence to uroepithelial tissues may be an important virulence determinant in these infections because most proteus strains adhere to desquamated uroepithelial cells. to identify the adherence factor responsible for this phenomenon, we sheared outer membrane material from 35so4-radiolabeled bacteria and allowed it to bind to uroepithelial cells. following sodium dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the major adherence element was a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 17,500 and was provisionally designated as the uroepithelial cell adhesin. this adhesin was purified by heat shock and gel filtration on sepharose cl-4b. after purification, the adhesin was  seen assembled as long, flexible rods by electron microscopy. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the subunit had limited homology with that of the k99 fimbriae of escherichia coli.

TI  == late intraphagosomal hydrogen ion concentration favors the in vitro antimicrobial capacity of a 37-kilodalton cationic granule protein of human neutrophil granulocytes.
AB  == we described previously (w.m. shafer, l.e. martin, and j.k. spitznagel, infect. immun. 45:29-35, 1984) the presence of a 37-kilodalton cationic antimicrobial protein (37k cap) in extracts of granules prepared from human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (pmn). in this investigation, we prepared 37k cap from pmn granule extracts by sequential ion-exchange and molecular-sieve chromatography and examined its antimicrobial activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. at concentrations of 5 micrograms/ml or lower, 37k cap exerted selective antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria. these bacteria included acinetobacter lwoffii, escherichia coli, neisseria gonorrhoeae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, salmonella typhi, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella sonnei. however, at 5 micrograms of 37k cap per ml, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens resisted this antimicrobial activity. the bactericidal activity of 37k cap was greatest in acidic (ph 5.5) as opposed to alkaline (ph 7.5) media. the level of s. typhimurium resistance to 37k cap correlated with the presence of o antigen in the lipopolysaccharide. in the absence of o antigen repeat units, resistance was  proportional to the length of the core oligosaccharide. these results suggest that 37k cap may contribute significantly to the ability of pmn to kill gram-negative bacteria by nonoxidative means, particularly as the maturing phagolysosome becomes acidified.

TI  == do clinical microbiology laboratories report complete bacteriology in urine from  patients with long-term urinary catheters?
AB  == bacteriuria associated with long-term urinary catheters (those in place for greater than or equal to 30 days) appears to be the most common nosocomial infection in u.s. medical care facilities. this bacteriuria is polymicrobial and  dynamic and accompanied by fevers, catheter obstructions, bacteremias, and deaths. we compared the reporting by our research laboratory of bacteria present  in urine from long-term-catheterized nursing home patients with that by two commercial laboratories. the commercial laboratories isolated significantly fewer bacterial species at 10(5) cfu/ml of urine specimen. organisms well recognized as causes of urinary tract infections in noncatheterized patients (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae) were isolated in comparable frequencies by both the research and commercial laboratories. however, other organisms, including uncommon uropathogens like providencia stuartii and morganella morganii, which were actually among the most frequent bacteriuric species in these long-term-catheterized patients, were isolated significantly less frequently by the commercial laboratories. reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may involve use of different techniques. more complete reporting may  lead to better understanding of the polymicrobial bacteriuria of long-term catheters and its associated complications. this, in turn, may result in improved patient care and infection control in nursing homes.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative bacilli to aminoglycosides. effects of 45 months of amikacin as first-line aminoglycoside therapy.
AB  == amikacin was instituted as the primary empiric aminoglycoside at the san juan veterans administration medical center in january 1982; at that time, 16 percent  of the strains at the hospital were gentamicin-resistant. a prospective surveillance study was designed to correlate detection of bacterial resistance with aminoglycoside use. in the current report, the baseline period, during which gentamicin was the first-line aminoglycoside, accounting for 61 percent of overall aminoglycoside use, is compared with the period from january 1982 to september 1985, during which the first-line aminoglycoside was amikacin, accounting for 85 percent of overall use. this study is ongoing. during the two periods, the patient population did not differ with regard to aminoglycoside therapy, indications, or overall aminoglycoside use (541 versus 680 patient days  per month). among the gram-negative bacilli isolated, the percent of strains resistant to amikacin was as follows: pre-baseline period/baseline period, 0.8/0.2 percent; amikacin-usage period, 3.6 percent. resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin during the period of amikacin use decreased from 16 to 11 percent for  gentamicin and from 17 to 11 percent for tobramycin. the decrease in resistance of the gram-negative bacilli to gentamicin varied among strains: the resistance of escherichia coli decreased from 8 to 4 percent; that of proteus mirabilis, from 12 to 5 percent; that of indole-positive proteus, from 19 to 12 percent; that of acinetobacter, from 57 to 23 percent; that of citrobacter, from 15 to 7 percent; and that of pseudomonas aeruginosa, from 24 to 16 percent. during the amikacin-usage period, amikacin resistance was unchanged for most strains, with the exception of p. aeruginosa, the resistance of which increased from 4.5 to 7.8 percent. of the 4,795 strains isolated, 174 were resistant to amikacin; of these, 29 pseudomonas strains were studied for all mechanisms of resistance. changes in  permeability were exhibited by 11 of the 29 strains; 14 strains exhibited the aac(6')-i enzyme, 10 strains exhibited the aph(3')-ii enzyme, and two strains exhibited ant(2") in addition to some other unidentified mechanism. multiple enzyme production was found in 15 of the strains. the use of amikacin as a first-line aminoglycoside is associated with a decrease in resistance to other aminoglycosides and a slight increase in overall resistance to amikacin among aerobic gram-negative bacilli. the usefulness of amikacin has not been affected at our institution.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone, was determined against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the mics for 90% of the isolates tested were 0.25 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.5 microgram/ml for streptococcus faecalis, 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains, and less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, salmonella and shigella spp., klebsiella spp., proteus spp., and citrobacter spp. ci-934 had activity superior to that of other quinolones against streptococci by four- to eightfold. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, ciprofloxacin was 2- to 18-fold more active; ofloxacin and norfloxacin were twofold more active or similar to ci-934. ci-934 inhibited ampicillin-cephalothin-resistant urinary isolates of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis and cefoxatime-resistant acinetobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii. the medium, inoculum size, and oxygen concentration, as well as the addition of serum, had not major effect on the activity of ci-934. magnesium at a concentration of 9 mm increased mics and mbcs four- to eightfold, and testing at  ph 6 increased mics as much as 32- to 64-fold for some organisms in comparison with mics at ph 7. the frequency of spontaneous mutation to resistance was comparable to that for other new quinolones, but resistant isolates could be selected by repeated subculture.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid was investigated against 285 freshly isolated clinical strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by the agar-dilution technique on mueller-hinton-agar. clavulanic acid had an excellent or moderate potentiating effect on the in-vitro  activity of ticarcillin against staphylococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter, haemophilus influenzae and bacteroides spp. no effect was seen against enterococci, indole-positive proteus spp., ent. cloacae, serratia marcescens and  pseudomonas aeruginosa. the effect of clavulanic acid was dose- and inoculum-dependent.

TI  == cephalosporins in cutaneous infections. a prospective comparison of two dosage regimens of ceftazidime for therapy of skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == the safety and efficacy of ceftazidime administered as 0.5 g every 8 hours (q8h)  or 1.0 g q8h for at least 5 days were compared in 197 patients and found to be effective in the treatment of cellulitis, abscesses, skin ulcers, and wound infections. staphylococcus aureus was the predominant pathogen in both treatment  groups with approximately half of the isolates from each treatment group being gram-positive. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common gram-negative isolate.  p. aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli each comprised 5-12% of the isolates from each treatment group. clinical cure or improvement was achieved in 98.7% of the patients in each treatment group. concurrently with clinically successful treatment, a high rate of bacteriologic eradication without superinfection was achieved with the 0.5-g regimen (84% of all isolates) and the  1.0-g regimen (92%).

TI  == expression of the proteus mirabilis lipoprotein gene in escherichia coli. existence of tandem promoters.
AB  == the ipp gene from proteus mirabilis was cloned onto pbr322 and expressed in escherichia coli. the p. mirabilis lpp gene is unique in that it has two tandem promoters transcribing two mrnas that differ in length by approximately 70 nucleotides at their 5'-ends. the two mrnas thus encode the identical lipoprotein. the p. mirabilis prolipoprotein has a 19-amino acid signal peptide and a 59-amino acid lipoprotein sequence. in spite of the substantial differences in the amino acid sequence from the e. coli prolipoprotein, the p. mirabilis prolipoprotein is normally modified and processed in e. coli, and the resultant lipoprotein is assembled in the e. coli outer membrane as is the e. coli lipoprotein.

AB  == a disinfectant (2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether: irgasan, ciba-geigy) was incorporated into plastic washers fabricated from ethylvinyl acetate (eva), polyethylene, polypropylene or tpx. plastics containing 0.2 and 2% irgasan gave zones of inhibition on nutrient and blood agar plates seeded with micro-organisms (staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis or candida albicans) even after thorough washing. exceptionally, c. albicans was  inhibited only by 2% irgasan, and eva gave good inhibition only against the staphylococci. similar washers of each plastic were implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of rabbits; before insertion each was washed, had thread woven into it and was surrounded by a plasma clot containing 2 x 10(8) staph. aureus. all the plastics without irgasan gave rise to abscesses, none of the plastics impregnated with 2% irgasan did, though from 2 out of 12 sites small numbers of staph. aureus were isolated at post mortem. using either clinical or bacteriological criteria,  the results were highly significant (p less than 0.00001 and p less than 0.001 respectively), demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique in preventing plastic-associated infection.

TI  == effect of inoculum size on ampicillin and amoxycillin susceptibility determined by gas-liquid chromatography for members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == inoculum size had only a small effect on the results for ampicillin and amoxycillin susceptibility testing of escherichia coli. in contrast, a difference in inoculum size from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml profoundly affected the results for ampicillin and amoxycillin susceptibility testing of proteus mirabilis, causing a change from susceptibility to complete resistance. these different effects of inoculum size were observed both when susceptibility was determined by the suppression of a characteristic metabolic product analyzed by head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc) and when it was determined by mic testing in broth. inoculum size affected the results for ampicillin susceptibility of p. mirabilis determined concurrently with the rapid hs-glc urine test, because 10(8) cfu/ml may occur in urine specimens. in the rapid test, significant numbers of escherichia, klebsiella, citrobacter, proteus, morganella, and providencia spp. in urine specimens are detected within 4 h by hs-glc analysis for characteristic  metabolic products in cultures. most p. mirabilis in urine specimens appeared to  be ampicillin resistant in the rapid hs-glc test but were reported to be ampicillin susceptible in hospital laboratory agar dilution tests 2 days later. however, ampicillin susceptibility results for escherichia, klebsiella, and citrobacter spp. agreed with hospital laboratory reports. it was concluded that reports of ampicillin susceptibility or resistance for the commonest cause of urinary tract infections, e. coli, within 4 h of receipt of the specimen would be clinically valuable and that a provisional report of ampicillin resistance for p. mirabilis would not lead to ineffective therapy.

TI  == escherichia coli adherence to anion exchange resin. in vitro model for initial screening of potential antiadherence agents.
AB  == the first step in developing a bladder infection is attachment of bacteria to the bladder epithelium. removing the bladder mucin increases bacterial adherence up to a thousand-fold, and this increase can be prevented by pretreating the mucin-deficient bladder with heparin. to develop a rapid, in vitro antiadherence  screening assay, we studied the adherence of escherichia coli to various chromatography resins and the ability of heparin and other agents to antagonize this attachment. the results can be summarized as follows: although e. coli attached to all resins, only the adherence to the anion exchange resin was inhibited by heparin (up to 95%). agents which did not effect e. coli adherence to the resin did not affect attachment to the bladder. agents which inhibited e.  coli adherence to the bladder also inhibited e. coli adherence to the resin. similar to the effect of heparin on e. coli attachment, the adherence of klebsiella ozaene, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus fecalis to both bladder epithelium and anion exchange resin were also antagonized. these studies indicate that the adherence of e. coli (as well as other bacterial species) to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a similar manner  as does adherence to the mucin-deficient rabbit urinary bladder. because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.

TI  == the efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  == a reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. a 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. the intestine was then divided at  each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. the segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. this experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. within three days 40% of the animals  receiving pefloxacin died. animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or  gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. only 5% of these animals died. thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == intraabdominal abscesses were induced in mice by intraperitoneal inoculation of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli plus bran as the abscess-potentiating agent. six- or seven-day-old abscesses were mechanically disaggregated in buffer, and the cells obtained were fractionated on discontinuous percoll density gradients. neutrophil populations of different density, each approximately 90% pure, were isolated. when the abscess-derived neutrophils were subsequently incubated with normal serum in vitro under aerobic conditions, the viability of the gram-negative bacteria that had been phagocytosed within the abscess did not  change significantly. this anergy to intracellular bacteria (on subsequent incubation in vitro under optimal conditions for phagocytic killing) was also found for neutrophils that had been obtained from abscesses induced by a mixture  that included proteus mirabilis plus b. fragilis and from those induced by e. coli plus p. mirabilis. while unable to significantly kill intracellular organisms that had been phagocytosed in vivo, the abscess-derived neutrophils could engulf and kill organisms to which they were exposed in vitro. neutrophils  from abscesses induced by p. mirabilis only plus bran killed that organism introduced in vitro significantly more effectively than the organisms that had been engulfed in vivo. in contrast, neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism staphylococcus aureus plus bran were able to kill their intracellular organisms on subsequent incubation in vitro as effectively as they  could kill added s. aureus. neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood and from induced peritoneal exudates of abscess-bearing mice were able to phagocytose and kill organisms in vitro with greater efficiency than abscess-derived neutrophils. the mechanism whereby neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism s. aureus can kill the organisms phagocytosed in vivo on subsequent in vitro incubation, in contrast to the relative anergy to their intracellular organisms displayed by neutrophils derived from abscesses induced by combinations of gram-negative bacteria, is not known.

AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

TI  == current state and tendencies of antibiotic resistance in hungary.
AB  == this survey is based on data for 245 903 isolates reported by public health network laboratories in 1983. facultatively pathogenic gram-negative bacteria comprised two-third of the isolates, and--except escherichia coli--were resistant in a high percent to the most frequently used antibiotics. oxacillin and vancomycin were the most effective against staphylococcus aureus being in 94.7% resistant to penicillin. in contrast to other streptococci, all streptococcus pyogenes strains were sensitive to penicillin. the majority of the gram-positive  strains were resistant to tetracycline. a comparison to results reported earlier  (1974 to 1983) showed an increasing resistance rate mainly to ampicillin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, which were introduced in therapy during this period. resistance rate of almost all species has increased to gentamicin, e.g. that of proteus mirabilis has risen tenfold. emergence of haemophilus influenzae resistant to ampicillin, and increasing resistance rates of p. mirabilis and streptococcus pneumoniae to almost all drugs are remarkable findings. the increasing or variable usage of drugs that have been used for a long time did not influence resistance markedly. in some instances the resistance rates even diminished, e.g. the tetracycline resistance of agents associated with enteric diseases. a restricted use of chloramphenicol reflected in a decreased resistance of some species. multiresistant gram-negative strains--which are resistant to all drugs frequently used in hungary--were isolated in 12.7% from a  representative clinical material. the frequent occurrence of multiresistant p. mirabilis and acinetobacter isolates is a new phenomenon. surprisingly, the percentage of multiresistant e. coli strains was very low. amikacin and netilmicin were found to be the most effective against multiresistant isolates.

(1) unchanged medium: escherichia coli, shigella spp., yersinia spp., hafnia alvei and morganella morganii 100% each, klebsiella spp., 50%, enterobacter cloacae 37%, proteus vulgaris 59%, acinetobacter spp. 42%, pseudomonas fluorescens 19%, some other bacteria 2-12%. (2) rusty-brown slant, unchanged butt: salmonella subgenera ii, iii and iv 98%, citrobacter freundii 65%, e. cloacae 55%, p. vulgaris 41%, proteus mirabilis 98%, providencia rettgeri 100%, urease-negative providencia 96%, acinetobacter spp. 58%, pseudomonas aeruginosa 100%, p. fluorescens 81%, ufp (unclassified fluorescent pseudomonads)  100%, other pseudomonas spp. 55%. (3) unchanged slant, brown butt: s. typhi 88%,  salmonella subgenus i 3%, klebsiella spp. 31%, some other bacteria 2-3%. (4) rusty-brown slant, brown butt: salmonella subgenus i 75%, c. freundii 20%, klebsiella spp. 12%, some other bacteria 1-5%. colour reactions in ferric ammonium citrate agar are associated with the accumulation of ferric hydroxide: bacteria giving positive reactions on the slant took up as an average, 63 times more iron than those with negative test. the localization of colour reaction correlated partly with aerobic and anaerobic citrate utilization or decomposition in simmons' minimal and in kauffmann's peptone water medium.

AB  == aminoglycosides and cephalosporins belong among antimicrobials with a pronounced  effect on most gram-negative rods. in vitro susceptibility and resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefsulodin,  cefoperazone in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested by the quantitative dilution micromethod. selected, highly susceptible strains of the above species were furthermore compared for minimal inhibitory concentration (mbc) and minimal  bactericidal concentration (mbc) values. aminoglycosides tended to be the most effective drugs for susceptible strains. in view of their relative toxicity possibly optimal combinations of individual aminoglycosides with individual cephalosporins are discussed.

TI  == expression of the proteus mirabilis reca gene in bacillus subtilis is directed by its own promoter.
AB  == the reca gene of proteus mirabilis (recapm) has been cloned into the psti site of the bacillus promoter-probe plasmid ppl603. when present on this plasmid, the recapm1) gene is expressed in b. subtilis under the control of its own transcriptional and translational signals. it is concluded that the high at-content of the dna sequence upstream of the -35 region is of decisive importance for the usage of the recapm promoter by the b. subtilis rna polymerase. the results are discussed in relation to the expression barriers found to exist for genes from gram-negative bacteria in the gram-positive b. subtilis.

TI  == providencia stuartii: a common cause of antibiotic-resistant bacteriuria in patients with long-term indwelling catheters.
AB  == the long-term-catheterized urinary tract may offer a particular niche to providencia stuartii, which is otherwise an uncommon clinical isolate. published  accounts of bacteriuria in patients catheterized for long periods indicate that p. stuartii has often been found as frequently as familiar uropathogens such as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. as in most nosocomial infections, the frequency of isolation of a given species has  commonly differed among institutions. in the future p. stuartii may be more frequently encountered as a nosocomial pathogen in nursing homes and in acute care hospitals to which bacteriuric patients are transferred. this trend appears  likely because of the increasingly large nursing-home population, the predilection of the bacterium for the long-term-catheterized urinary tract, the opportunity for nosocomial transmission from this reservoir, the resistance of the organism to multiple antibiotics, and the occasional systemic illness and bacteremia caused by p. stuartii.

TI  == [clinical experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of severe infections in general surgery].
AB  == in a prospective study 43 patients (19 men, 24 women) suffering from severe bacterial infections such as peritonitis (n = 16), soft tissue infection (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 7), septicemia (n = 6), catheter sepsis (n = 2), cholangitis  (n = 4), osteomyelitis (n = 3), complicated urinary tract infection (n = 2) or endocarditis (n = 1) were treated t. i. d. with short-time i. v. infusions of 0.5 g imipenem/cilastatin for five to 37 days (means = 9). all the patients were cured or significantly improved following therapy with imipenem/cilastatin alone  or in combination with surgical intervention. the most frequent isolates were escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. 58 (83%) of the 70 pathogens isolated initially were eliminated. the 12 microorganisms (gram-negative aerobic bacteria) which persisted were non-contributory to the course of the infection and had mics between 0.32 and 4 mg/l. the mics for 60 isolates were less than or equal to 1 mg/l; the mics for nine isolates were in the range of 2 to 8 mg/l. one s. epidermidis isolate presented primary resistance to imipenem (mic 16 mg/l). the tolerability was good. phlebitis was observed in one case only. based on our experience we conclude that monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage of 0.5 g t. i. d. is appropriate for the treatment of severe bacterial infections.

AB  == the potential of octenidine hydrochloride (win 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. semilogarithmic survival curves were  plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against staphylococcus aureus. the microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and candida albicans. death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microm (0.94 microgram/ml)  caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and e. coli and c. albicans were the least susceptible. octenidine was more active than  chlorhexidine against each test strain. skin-degerming activities of aqueous and  formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. aqueous  octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.

TI  == interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  == in escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (mbp), the product of the male gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. it is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). in studies of the maltose system in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae, we found that mbp is produced by salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and serratia marcescens. mbp from  all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the e. coli protein and  had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). the shigella flexneri and proteus  mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize mbp. the isoelectric points of mbp from different species varied from the acid extreme of e. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of e. aerogenes (8.9). all species with mbp transported maltose with high affinity, although the vmax for k. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. maltose chemotaxis was observed only in e. coli  and e. aerogenes. in s. typhimurium lt2, tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. mbp isolated from  all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta male strain of e. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.

TI  == an investigation into in vitro methods for the detection of chlorhexidine resistance.
AB  == during an outbreak of catheter-related urinary tract infection, due to proteus mirabilis, it was suggested that the epidemic strain was resistant to chlorhexidine. in this study, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chlorhexidine to the epidemic pr. mirabilis and other laboratory isolates were tested in different media. results were compared with killing times using 1/4 strength ringers solution, normal human urine and the in vivo killing times in two patients' catheter bags. it was found that the mic test was unreliable in the assessment of chlorhexidine resistance as it was dependent on the medium used, the inoculum size, and the age of the culture. the test which gave results closest to the in vivo experiments was the killing curve in normal human urine. it is concluded that chlorhexidine resistance is a complex phenomenon which is difficult to evaluate. if in vitro tests are to be used to evaluate the clinical  relevance of reduced sensitivity to chlorhexidine, they must mimic the in-use conditions as closely as possible.

AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

AB  == tissue obtained by biopsy of the bladder from 33 patients with various urinary tract symptoms was studied by conventional bacteriological techniques and by scanning electron microscopy (sem). all the patients had recurrent urinary tract  symptoms which had not completely responded to antibiotic therapy. eleven of the  patients had greater than or equal to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu) of bacteria/1 urine; six had between 10(6) and 10(7) cfu/1, and 16 were abacteruric. bacteria were isolated, however, from the tissue obtained by biopsy from eight of the 16 patients with sterile urine and bacteria were seen on the uro-epithelium in 14 of these patients. by comparison, in all samples of tissue obtained from the 11 patients with greater than or equal to 10(8) cfu/1 of urine bacteria were  seen on the uro-epithelium and from nine of these, bacteria were subsequently grown. fastidious organisms were not isolated from any of the patients. the uro-epithelium of all those studied was also shown to be grossly disrupted with increased disturbance and loss of the epithelial cells when compared with tissue  obtained from uninfected patients. the degree of uro-epithelial disturbance was greatest in patients with histories of urinary tract infections lasting more than 4 months. the findings suggest that bacteriological examination of the urine does not always reflect bacterial infection on the bladder surface nor disruption of the uro-epithelium. the changes on the bladder surface may explain the patients'  symptoms. in view of the results, a scheme is proposed that explains the development of symptoms in patients with urinary tract and bladder infections.

TI  == further characterization of bacterial adherence to urinary bladder mucosa: comparison with adherence to anion exchange resin.
AB  == bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin has recently been reported to provide a useful, rapid, in vitro screening assay for identifying putative antiadherence  agents. the studies presented in this report provide additional evidence that adherence to anion exchange resin is similar to urinary bladder mucosa adherence. results are as follows. 1) heparin inhibits the adherence of escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus fecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to both the mucin deficient bladder and anion exchange resin. 2) drugs which inhibit e. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibit e. coli adherence to  the resin and conversely, drugs which do not effect e. coli adherence to the resin do not affect attachment to the bladder. 3) extracts from mammalian urinary bladder mucosa prevent e. coli adherence to both the bladder and resin. 4) the ability of heparin to displace preattached bacteria from anion exchange resin is  inversely proportional to the time the bacteria are in contact with resin. similar results were obtained for the ability of heparin to displace bacteria from the bladder. these studies indicate that bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a manner similar  to the mucin deficient rabbit urinary bladder. because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of  bacterial attachment.

TI  == role of aerobic gram-negative bacilli in endometritis after cesarean section.
AB  == endometritis is considered to be a polymicrobial infection, involving aerobes, anaerobes, and genital mycoplasmas. aerobic gram-negative rods make up 7%-25% of  all genital isolates, but findings from studies in which special collection techniques were used suggest that many of these may be contaminants from the lower genital tract. bacteremia occurs in 4%-30% of patients with endometritis, and aerobic gram-negative rods account for approximately 25% of blood isolates. both selected therapy studies and studies of intrauterine cultures collected at surgery from patients at risk for endometritis suggest the significant role of aerobic gram-negative rods. among them escherichia coli is the most common isolate in both genital and blood cultures. klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis rank next, followed by enterobacter species. pseudomonas species account for fewer than 0.6% of genital isolates. overall, aerobic gram-negative rods are causally involved in 10%-20% of cases of endometritis following cesarean section.

TI  == cell cycle parameters of proteus mirabilis: interdependence of the biosynthetic cell cycle and the interdivision cycle.
AB  == we investigated the time periods of dna replication, lateral cell wall extension, and septum formation within the cell cycle of proteus mirabilis. cells were cultivated under three different conditions, yielding interdivision times of approximately 55, 57, and 160 min, respectively. synchrony was achieved by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. the time periods were estimated by division inhibition studies with cephalexin, mecillinam, and nalidixic acid. in addition, dna replication was measured by thymidine incorporation, and murein biosynthesis was measured by incorporation of n-acetylglucosamine into sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble murein sacculi. at interdivision times of 55 to 57 min  murein biosynthesis for reproduction of a unit cell lasted longer than the interdivision time itself, whereas dna replication finished within 40 min. surprisingly, inhibition of dna replication by nalidixic acid did not inhibit the subsequent cell division but rather the one after that. because p. mirabilis fails to express several reactions of the reca-dependent sos functions known from escherichia coli, the drug allowed us to determine which dna replication period actually governed which cell division. taken together, the results indicate that  at an interdivision time of 55 to 57 min, the biosynthetic cell cycle of p. mirabilis lasts approximately 120 min. to achieve the observed interdivision time, it is necessary that two subsequent biosynthetic cell cycles be tightly interlocked. the implications of these findings for the regulation of the cell cycle are discussed.

AB  == of nine hundred ampicillin resistant (amp-r) enterobacteria strains, isolated in  hospital between july and december 1981, 73,7% are also carbenicillin-resistant (carb-r). this particular double resistance varies depending upon the species considered: indole positive proteus (23%), enterobacter cloacae (64%), citrobacter freundii (67%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (73%), proteus mirabilis  (75%), serratia marcescens (90%), escherichia coli (91%), providencia stuartii (96%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (100%). the biochemical and genetic basis of resistance to beta-lactamines was studied in 27 strains belonging to these 9 species. a constitutive beta-lactamase was found in all the strains. these enzymes were identified by determination of the isoelectric point on crude sonic  extracts, the enzymic activity profile, the inhibition by clavulanic acid and cloxacillin of enzyme activity. two types of enzymes were predominant: tem-1 (20  strains) and tem-2 (7 strains); two strains of klebsiella pneumoniae produced both shv-1 and tem-1. the transfer by conjugation to e. coli k12 of ampicillin and carbenicillin resistance was obtained with 14 strains: (e. coli: 9, c. freundii: 1, k. pneumoniae: 1, e. cloacae: 2, p. stuartii: 1). in all strains but one e. coli we noted the co-transfer of other antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == resistance to chloramphenicol in proteus mirabilis by expression of a chromosomal gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.
AB  == proteus mirabilis pm13 is a well-characterized chloramphenicol-sensitive isolate  which spontaneously gives rise to resistant colonies on solid media containing chloramphenicol (50 micrograms ml-1) at a plating efficiency of 10(-4) to 10(-5). such chloramphenicol-resistant colonies exhibit a novel phenotype with respect to chloramphenicol resistance. when a single colony grown on chloramphenicol agar is transferred to liquid medium and grown in the absence of antibiotic for 150 generations, a population of predominantly sensitive cells arises. this mutation-reversion phenomenon has been observed in other proteus species and providencia strains, wherein resistance has been shown to be mediated in each case by the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. the cat gene responsible for the phenomenon is chromosomal and can be cloned from p. mirabilis pm13 with dna prepared from cells grown in the absence or the presence of chloramphenicol.  recombinant plasmids which confer resistance to chloramphenicol carry an 8.5-kilobase psti fragment irrespective of the source of host dna. the location of the cat gene within the psti fragment was determined by southern blotting with a cat consensus oligonucleotide corresponding to the expected amino acid sequence of the active site region of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and the direction of transcription was deduced from homology with the type i cat variant.

TI  == effects of antimicrobial agents fed to chickens on some gram-negative enteric bacilli.
AB  == total and antimicrobial agent-resistant aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative enteric bacilli in fecal samples of broiler chickens fed growth-promotional levels of antimicrobial agents were determined quantitatively. two 8-week studies were conducted utilizing groups of chickens fed antimicrobial-supplemented rations; the second study involved feed "pasteurization" as a means of minimizing colonization from the feed. dilution/spread-plating/replica-plating techniques on selective media were used to obtain counts of total organisms and those resistant to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, ampicillin, or kanamycin. the predominant aerobic  and facultative anaerobic gram-negative organism was escherichia coli, which was  detected in all samples at levels ranging from 10(5) to over 10(10) cfu/g of feces. less common were proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas sp., which varied in occurrence and levels from group to group (range, less than  10(3) to 10(8) cfu/g). resistance to all antimicrobials (except chloramphenicol in e. coli) was commonly observed at incidences exceeding 10(3) cfu/g in the total populations. colonization of the chickens' intestinal tracts by susceptible and resistant strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and pseudomonas sp. appeared to  result from their presence in the environment of the newly hatched chickens. ration pasteurization did affect p. mirabilis, which appeared to colonize from the feed. the results suggest that colonization by, and proliferation of, antimicrobial-resistant aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative enteric bacilli in chicken intestinal tracts may be less dependent on selection through antimicrobial supplementation of the ration than on their prevalence in environments from which they can colonize newborns.

AB  == after iv, im, and subcutaneous injection of single dosages of amikacin (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of body weight) in each of 4 dogs, the elimination kinetics of amikacin were determined. the pattern of urinary excretion and cumulative amount  excreted unchanged in 24 hours were also determined. amikacin had a short half-life (approx 1 hour) that was independent of the dosage. intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg gave apparent volume of distribution of 226 +/- 37 ml/kg and body clearance of 2.64 +/- 0.24 ml/min.kg (mean +/- sd, n = 4). within 6 hours, greater than 90% of the antibiotic was excreted in the urine, regardless of the route of administration. for isolates of common bacterial species from the canine urinary tract, minimum inhibitory concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin,  tobramycin, and kanamycin were determined in vitro. cumulative percentages were approximately the same for urinary isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coagulase-positive staphylococci that were susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) to increasing concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin, in vitro. klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly more susceptible to amikacin than were the other bacteria evaluated. widest variations in susceptibility to aminoglycosides were found with urinary isolates of streptococcal species. for dogs with normal renal function, an amikacin dosage of 10 mg/kg (im or subcutaneously) is recommended every 8 hours for treatment of systemic infections, and every 12 hours for treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

AB  == a number of bacterial strains (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and streptococci), obtained from patients with urinary infections, or from vaginal tampons, were assayed in order to evaluate their ability to adhere to uroepithelial cells. we employed, at a comparative purpose, two different methods to eliminate unattached bacteria: the centrifugation technique and the filtration technique. the effect of the pretreatment with subinhibitory concentrations of three chemotherapeutics widely employed in the urological practice (norfloxacin,  pipemidic acid and co-trimoxazole) was determined on the strains which demonstrated a good rate of attachment. growth in the presence of any of the three drugs decreased the adhesive properties of the microorganisms, reducing both the haemagglutination and the yeast aggregation titers of gram-negative bacteria as well as their adhesiveness. norfloxacin proved to be the most effective drug in affecting the pathogenicity characteristics of the assayed strains in comparison with the other two chemotherapeutics tested, even if they were also moderately able to inhibit the adhesiveness of the same strains.

AB  == the binding of the outer membrane-disorganizing peptide polymyxin b nonapeptide (pmbn) to gram-negative bacteria was studied by using tritium-labeled pmbn. smooth salmonella typhimurium had a binding capacity of ca. 6 nmol of pmbn per mg (dry weight) of bacteria, which corresponds to ca. 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) molecules of pmbn per single cell. the binding was of relatively high affinity (kd, 1.3 microm). the isolated outer membrane of s. typhimurium bound ca. 100 nmol of pmbn per mg of outer membrane protein (kd, 1.1 microm), whereas the cytoplasmic membrane bound 9 to 10 times less. other bacteria which are susceptible to the action of pmbn (escherichia coli strains, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae) also bound large amounts of pmbn. the s. typhimurium pmra mutant, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and proteus mirabilis (all known  as resistant to polymyxin and pmbn) bound 3.3, 4, and 12 times less than s. typhimurium, respectively. the binding of pmbn to s. typhimurium was effectively  inhibited by low concentrations of polymyxin b, compound em49 (octapeptin), polylysine, and protamine. spermine, ca2+, and mg2+ also inhibited the pmbn binding although they were ca. 160, 700, and 2,400 times less active (based on molarity) than polymyxin b, respectively. no binding inhibition was found at the  tested concentrations of streptomycin, tetralysine, spermidine, or cadaverine.

TI  == norfloxacin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the therapy of uncomplicated, community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  == in a prospective, randomized trial, norfloxacin (400 mg perorally, twice a day) was compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160-800 mg perorally, twice a day) in 45 patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. escherichia coli was the most common isolate. infections due to enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas spp., and staphylococcus spp. were also treated. norfloxacin was equivalent in effectiveness and safety to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with a cure rate of 91% at the 5- to 9-day posttherapy visit and 88% at the 4- to 6-week posttherapy visit. it was well tolerated and had a low incidence of side effects.

TI  == isolation of altered reca polypeptides and interaction with atp and dna.
AB  == in this paper we describe the partial proteolytic digestion of reca proteins from escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis and the production and isolation of truncated reca polypeptides. a proteolytic fragment of the p. mirabilis reca protein bound single-strand dna and atp normally but has altered duplex dna binding properties. this protein was shown to initiate but not complete dna strand transfer from a dna duplex to a complementary single strand. the product of the e. coli reca1 allele bound but could not hydrolyze atp and the protein bound single-strand but not double-strand dna. this protein did not appear to initiate the transfer of a strand from a linear duplex to a single-strand circle  and inhibited the wild-type reca protein from performing strand transfer. we report that reca protein binds linear duplex dna in a manner that enhances the rate of ligation by t4 dna ligase. when heterologous single-strand dna was added  in addition to the duplex dna large stable aggregates of protein and dna were formed that could easily be sedimented from solution.

AB  == to study the concrement-forming ability of ureaplasma urealyticum in the urinary  tract, viable and heat-killed ureaplasmas as well as urease and non-urease-producing bacteria were inoculated into the bladder in rats. viable ureaplasmas, in contrast to heat-killed, caused the formation of bladder stones with a frequency corresponding to urease-producing bacteria (proteus mirabilis).  it was not possible to reculture the inoculated ureaplasmas from the urinary tract. non-urease producing microorganisms (escherichia coli and mycoplasma hominis) only occasionally induced stone formation. the results indicate that u.  urealyticum can initiate stone formation, a property that appears to be associated with the urease activity of the organism.

AB  == the production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. the genera were: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, rare enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. with this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. the data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. the nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.

TI  == structural studies on the lipid a component of enterobacterial lipopolysaccharides by laser desorption mass spectrometry. location of acyl groups at the lipid a backbone.
AB  == in the present paper laser desorption mass spectrometry (ldms) was applied to dephosphorylated free lipid a preparations obtained from lipopolysaccharides of re mutants of salmonella minnesota, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. the purpose of this study was to elucidate the location of (r)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid and 3-o-acylated (r)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid residues which are bound to amino and hydroxyl groups of the glucosamine disaccharide backbone of lipid a. based on the previous finding from biochemical analyses that the amino group of the nonreducing glucosamine residue (glcn ii) of the backbone carries, in s. minnesota and e. coli, 3-dodecanoyloxytetradecanoic acid and, in p. mirabilis, 3-tetradecanoyloxytetradecanoic acid, a self-consistent interpretation of the ldms was possible. it was found that: (a) in all three lipids a glcn ii is, besides the amide-linked 3-acyloxyacyl residue, substituted by ester-linked 3-tetradecanoyloxytetradecanoic acid; (b) the reducing glucosamine (glcn i) is substituted by ester-linked 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid; (c) the amino group of glcn i carries a 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid which is non-acylated in e. coli and which is partially acylated by hexadecanoic acid in s. minnesota and p. mirabilis. in lipids a which were obtained from the p. mirabilis re mutant grown  at low temperature (12 degrees c) ldms analysis revealed that specifically the one fatty acid bound to the 3-hydroxyl group of amide-linked 3-hydroxytetra-decanoic acid at glcn ii is positionally replaced by delta 9-hexadecenoic acid (palmitoleic acid). it appears, therefore, that enterobacterial lipids a resemble each other in that the 3-hydroxyl groups of the two 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid residues linked to glcn ii are fully acylated, while those of the two 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid groups attached to glcn i are  free or only partially substituted.

TI  == an evaluation of the bacteriolytic and biochemical properties of ceftiolene (42980rp).
AB  == ceftiolene (42980rp) is a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum similar to cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. the characteristics of ceftiolene have been tested in a variety of assays involving various biochemical aspects of the mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics. the affinities of ceftiolene for penicillin-binding proteins were very comparable with those of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime for escherichia coli, and generally greater than those of latamoxef (moxalactam) for the higher molecular weight pbps of e. coli. enterobacter cloacae. proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the affinity of ceftiolene for pbp1 of staphylococcus aureus was greater than those of cefotaxime or latamoxef, but comparable with these antibiotics for pbp3. the bacteriolytic activity of ceftiolene at defined concentrations against gram-negative organisms  was similar to that of ceftriaxone, and significantly better than that of the other third-generation cephalosporins tested. introduction of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases into e. coli reduced the wide variation in bacteriolytic effect of the different cephalosporins, and a significant inoculum effect was observed for the bacteriolysis. chloramphenicol was less antagonistic against ceftiolene-  or ceftriaxone-induced lysis than was observed for cefotaxime or latamoxef. growth of staph. aureus at low concentrations of ceftiolene caused the bacteria to become more sensitive to lysis by lysostaphin than organisms grown with cefotaxime or latamoxef under the same conditions. these observations confirm the necessity to use techniques other than routine mic determinations to distinguish  between antibiotics which would otherwise appear very similar.

AB  == the effect of pre-incubation of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae with subinhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime on adherence and polymorphonuclear leukocyte function against these organisms was studied. culturing the above organisms in the presence of cefotaxime (1/4 mic) resulted in reduced adherence of pseudomonas aeruginosa and  proteus mirabilis. furthermore pre-incubation of all organisms with sub mics of cefotaxime resulted in significant enhancement of polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis and bactericidal activity against these organisms.

TI  == pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 20 strains of facultative or anaerobic gram-positive cocci (agpc) was investigated by injecting them alone or mixed with other flora into mice, utilizing the subcutaneous abscess model. abscesses induced by a mixture of two organisms were uniformly larger than those induced by single organisms. the relationships among seven agpc strains, eight aerobes, and two bacteroides spp. were determined by treating the infected animals with antibiotics and observing the effect of therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. a total of 70 different combinations were tested. as judged by their responses to antimicrobial therapy, facultative cocci or agpc were relatively more important than the other species in 6 combinations, equally important in 35  combinations, and less important in 29 combinations. the agpc most often found to be equal to or more important than the other bacteria were peptococcus magnus, streptococcus constellatus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus were frequently found to be of more importance than the agpc.

TI  == effect of ammonium on bacterial adherence to bladder transitional epithelium.
AB  == the virulence of urease-producing bacteria depends on the ability of urease to degrade urea into ammonia and thereby to alkalinize the urine. infections caused  by urease-producing organisms such as proteus mirabilis are particularly difficult to manage clinically. we have shown that the layer of glycosaminoglycans at the bladder surface protects against infection by blocking  the adherence of bacteria to the epithelium. to determine whether urease-producing urinary pathogens owe their virulence in part to an ability to inactivate the protective effect of the glycosaminoglycan layer, we tested the ability of ammonium chloride to alter bacterial adherence to the normal vesical mucosa. we used an in vivo adherence assay that we have described previously in rabbits. control animals received sodium chloride adjusted to the same ph as the  ammonium chloride. we found that 0.25 m ammonium chloride significantly increases bacterial adherence to normal vesical mucosa as compared to adherence in controls receiving 0.25 m sodium chloride (p less than 0.05). these data suggest that urease plays a hitherto undescribed role in bacterial virulence by altering the antiadherence activity of the glycosaminoglycan layer present at the transitional cell surface.

TI  == transition of deletion mutants of the composite resistance plasmid nr1 in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == derivatives of the composite r plasmid nr1 from which a portion of the resistance determinants (r-determinants) component had been deleted were found to undergo amplification of the remaining r-determinants region in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the wild-type nr1 plasmid does not amplify in these genera, although all of these plasmids undergo amplification in proteus mirabilis. the deletion mutants retained the mercuric ion resistance operon (mer) but conferred a much lower level of sulfonamide resistance than nr1. the remaining r-determinants region, which is bounded by direct repeats of the insertion element is1, formed multiple tandem duplications in e. coli, s. typhimurium, and p. mirabilis after subculturing the host cells in medium containing high concentrations of sulfonamide. gene amplification was characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis, analytical buoyant density centrifugation, dna-dna hybridization, and sedimentation in sucrose gradients. the tandem repeats remained attached to the resistance transfer factor component  of the plasmid in at least part of the plasmid population; autonomous tandem repeats of r-determinants were probably also present. amplification did not occur in host reca mutants. amplified strains subcultured in drug-free medium lost the  amplified r-determinants. by using a strain temperature sensitive for the reca gene, it was possible to obtain gene amplification at the permissive temperature. loss of r-determinants took place at the permissive temperature, but not at the nonpermissive temperature. the termini of the deletions of several independent mutants which conferred low sulfonamide resistance were found to be located within the adjacent streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance gene.

TI  == antibiotic sensitivities of urinary pathogens, 1971-82.
AB  == all urinary pathogens from general practice and from hospital have been tested for sensitivity to a range of antimicrobial drugs for the last 12 years. during that period there have been marked changes. in general practice there has been a  marked increase in the proportion of staphylococcal infections, from 5.1% to 14.8%, and a noticeable decrease in the proportion caused by proteus mirabilis, from 9.2% to 4.1%. similar, but smaller, changes have been seen in the proportions of hospital uti caused by those organisms, while the proportion of hospital infections due to klebsiella-enterobacter spp. has fallen from 16.8% to  8.3%. these, and other, changes have been reflected in changing antibiotic sensitivity patterns. in particular, sensitivity of urinary pathogens to ampicillin/amoxycillin and to cephaloridine has continued to fall both in general practice and in hospital. in general practice uti nalidixic acid-resistance is becoming more important as the proportion of gram-positive urinary pathogens increases. there has been little change in sensitivity to trimethoprim or co-trimoxazole over the last 12 years.

AB  == two hundred and ninety-six bacterial isolates were investigated for the effects of saliva and alpha-amylase on their susceptibility to ampicillin, tetracycline,  chloramphenicol and gentamicin. when the test organisms were primed with normal and 'diseased' saliva there were no observable differences in the mics of ampicillin and chloramphenicol for group-a streptococci, but alpha-amylase significantly reduced the mic of tetracycline from 2 to 0.25 mg/1. with staphyloccus aureus, priming with saliva and alpha-amylase had no effect on the mics of gentamicin and ampicillin, whereas the mics of tetracycline and chloramphenicol were increased. the effect of saliva on the susceptibility of e.  coli to tetracycline was also significant; mic50 and mic90 were reduced from 128  to 8 and 32 mg/1 respectively. chloramphenicol was however increased from less than 0.125 to 1 and 2 mg/1 when e. coli was primed with amylase and saliva respectively. the general significance of these observations is discussed.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of four oral cephems: cephalexin, cefaclor, cefatrizine and cefadroxil against clinical isolates of staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa was compared by agar dilution method. all drugs had comparable antistaphylococcal activity. cefatrizine and cefaclor were more active than cephalexin and cefadroxil against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. all four drugs were relatively inactive against isolates of enterobacter species and indole-positive proteus. however, cefatrizine demonstrated the greatest activity of the four oral cephems  against these organisms. none of these oral cephems was active against serratia marcescens or pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid was compared with that of ticarcillin alone, piperacillin, cefotaxime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 301 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. mics of the combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were expressed as mics of ticarcillin in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/l of clavulanic acid. against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii and serratia marcescens), ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was as active as or more active than piperacillin. against staphylococcus aureus. haemophilus influenzae and the bacteroides fragilis group  the combination was considerably more active than piperacillin. piperacillin was  more active than the ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination against pseudomonas  aeruginosa.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activities of eight new beta-lactam compounds against cephalothin-resistant enterobacteriaceae from hospital patients.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of eight newer beta-lactam antibiotics (mecillinam, piperacillin, mezlocillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime) was determined against 87 cephalothin-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae isolated during 6 months in a general hospital. ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, moxalactam and ceftazidime proved to be highly active; only a minority of strains required higher concentrations than 0.125 microgram/ml for inhibition of growth. cefoxitin, mecillinam, mezlocillin and piperacillin were less active. mecillinam displayed greater efficacy against escherichia coli, klebsiella and enterobacter spp., while the same was the case for piperacillin against proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens, and for cefoxitin against indole-positive proteus spp. the production of beta-lactamase was correlated with a reduced activity of mecillinam, mezlocillin and piperacillin but not of cefoxitin or the other beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporins. however, some strains, mainly those of proteus, enterobacter and serratia, though resistant to  mecillinam, mezlocillin and piperacillin did not produce beta-lactamases. this observation might indicate that ceftriaxone, moxalactam, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, besides their indifference to beta-lactamases, are characterized also by a high degree of intrinsic activity.

AB  == fk 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as citrobacter and enterobacter species and serratia marcescens. fk 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative proteus species, providencia species, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. with few exceptions, fk 027 was active against strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. the bactericidal activity of fk 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including proteus species, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, and s. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. the therapeutic activities of fk 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  == in a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics90) against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter aerogenes. subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized,  crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. the 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. the area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at  least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the mic90 for all seven groups of pathogens;  at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the mic90 against the majority of bacterial groups. in contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the mic90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin  were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. these data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the mics90  longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.

TI  == determination of surface charge of some bacteria by colloid titration.
AB  == the surface charge of bacteria is always negative except below ph 2. the negative charge depends mainly upon phosphate and carboxyl groups. the charge of six kinds of bacteria was determined by colloid titration between ph 2 and 11. when there is amino group on the cell surface, it is positive as ammonium cation between ph  2 and 10, and it combines with the negative groups to neutralize the negative charge. in the presence of formalin, the colloid titration results show that the  free amine is blocked by formalin, and the amino group can be estimated by the difference between the two titration results. above ph 10, the titration results  of escherichia coli and salmonella typhi in the presence of formalin implied the  existence of guanidyl group. the titration results of living bacterial suspensions were quite the same as those of heat-killed ones.

TI  == anomalous expression of the e. coli lac operon in proteus mirabilis. ii. effects  of laci and lacp mutations.
AB  == the lac operon introduced into proteus mirabilis shows two anomalies of expression: the maximal induced level is reduced by about an order of magnitude,  and the basal level becomes about 100 times higher than in e. coli, as a result of which the induction ratio appears very small, around 2-5 in contrast to as much as 1000 in e. coli. it was suggested by baumberg and dennison (1975) that the two anomalies might be manifestations of a single effect whereby some exogenous promoters give poor expression in this host, since they could result from poor expression of the laczya and laci promoters respectively. we show here  that when the lacp class ii promoter mutation l305 was transferred on an f-prime  into p. mirabilis, its effect on lac expression was much as in e. coli. however,  when flac bearing the iq1 up-promoter mutation was introduced into p. mirabilis,  the basal level decreased by three orders of magnitude, in accord with poor expression of laci+ being responsible for the usual low induction ratio. these results are consistent with the hypothesis of baumberg and dennison (1975) but do not prove it: poor expression of laci and/or laczya could also result from weak translation initiation, problems of continuation of transcription or translation  (e.g. due to pause sequences or differences in codon use), or diminished mrna stability.

TI  == anomalous expression of the e. coli lac operon in proteus mirabilis. i. effects of l8 and l8 uv5.
AB  == the lac operon shows anomalous expression in proteus mirabilis: the maximal induced level is 10% or less of that in e. coli, while repression reduces this by a factor of only 2-5. we have sought to determine whether this effect relates in  any way to crp-mediated activation of expression, by comparing expression in p. mirabilis of lac operons (introduced for technical reasons on incp1 plasmids) either regulatorily wild-type or bearing l8 or l8uv5. derivatives of rp1 bearing  l8uv5 were obtained by homogenotisation of pgc9114 (rp1::tn951) in a l8uv5 background; while derivatives of rp4 bearing lac+, l8 or l8uv5 were obtained by mu-mediated translocation of chromosomal regions bearing these alleles, following partial heat-induction of mucts62 on pgm14 (rp4::mucts62) in the appropriate hosts. these plasmids could be readily transferred to, and stably maintained in,  the p. mirabilis strains employed. it was found that l8 reduced the maximal level of beta-galactosidase activity, and l8uv5 restored this activity to around wild-type, in p. mirabilis quantitatively very much as in e. coli. nevertheless,  the low maximal level of expression and high basal level characteristic of the former host were unchanged. the simplest explanation of these results is that p.  mirabilis contains a protein that mimics the e. coli crp protein in interacting with the appropriate dna binding site and thereby stimulating transcription; and  that the anomalous regulation of lac in this host is unconnected with the crp system.

TI  == do antibody-coated bacteria reflect local immune response in the urinary tract?
AB  == we examined whether antibody-coated bacteria (acb) reflect local immune response  or passive adsorption of immune globulins (ig). for this purpose, bacterial subcultures from infected urines and third-party bacteria were incubated with ig  preparations. these were obtained from infected urine either by removal of ig from acb (dissociation in alpha-methylmannoside, 0.1 m glycine-hcl, or 3 m nascn) or by staphylococcal protein a affinity chromatography from the supernatant of infected urine. coincubation of either ig preparation with bacterial substrains of the original urine and with third-party strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, several escherichia coli strains, enterococci, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus) caused coating of the bacterial surface with ig. coating was not measurably influenced by coincubation  with various carbohydrates or by preincubation of bacteria with glucosidases. adsorption of ig was observed after heat denaturation and formalin treatment of bacteria and was independent of bacterial growth phase. coating was observed both with intact igg and with f(ab)2 fragments. we further examined the proportion of  bacteria coated with iga, igg, and igm in urines of 200 bacteriuric women with symptomatic urinary tract infection. the frequency histogram plot showed a continuous nonlinear unimodal distribution. consequently, any selection of a 'normal range' is arbitrary. it is concluded that coating of the bacterial surface with ig may not necessarily reflect local immune response. a major problem of the acb test is definition of the normal range.

TI  == the effects of heparin on the adherence of five species of urinary tract pathogens to urinary bladder mucosa.
AB  == previous studies performed in our laboratory have indicated that the primary antibacterial defense mechanism of the rabbit urinary bladder is the antiadsorptive action of the surface mucopolysaccharide. removal of this layer with an acid rinse increases bacterial adherence up to 100 fold. exogenous mucopolysaccharide (heparin) has been shown to restore escherichia coli adherence to control levels. to determine whether this antiadherence action of heparin is species specific, we compared the adherence of 5 common urinary tract pathogens (escherichia coli, klebsiella ozonae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and streptococcus fecalis) to both mucin intact and mucin deficient rabbit bladders with and without prior heparin exposure. bacteria were radiolabeled by addition of 3h-adenine to the culture broth so that the number of bacteria adhering to the bladder could be determined using liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. results were as follows: acid removal of the mucin layer significantly increased the adherence approximately 10 fold for all 5 species tested. briefly exposing the mucin deficient bladders to heparin decreased the adherence of all species tested except pseudomonas to mucin intact control levels. heparin treatment of mucin intact bladders slightly decreased adherence of all species except pseudomonas below mucin intact controls, however, results were not statistically significant. the magnitude of klebsiella adherence was nearly 20 fold greater than all other species tested. while this non-species specific adherence inhibition of heparin may prove useful in the clinical setting, it appears to be less effective against pseudomonas.

TI  == endotoxemia induced by antibiotic therapy: a mechanism for adrenal corticosteroid protection in gram-negative sepsis.
AB  == the following have been demonstrated: with a standardized model of p. mirabilis peritonitis in icr mice, when optimal doses of an aminoglycoside antibiotic (kanamycin) are given so as to reduce mortality maximally, abrupt and significant increments occur in endotoxemia, which cannot be attributed to impairment of clearance of endotoxin. within the antibiotic-treated groups, these increments in endotoxemia correlate with mortality. the level of endotoxemia in the antibiotic-treated survivors is significantly greater than in animals dying without antibiotic therapy. mp, although unable to reduce mortality from p. mirabilis peritonitis in the absence of antibiotic therapy, does so when endotoxin is added to the challenge inoculum. it is concluded from these observations that aminoglycoside antibiotic treatment can shift the lethal mechanisms during p. mirabilis peritonitis from those involving bacterial proliferation and low levels of endotoxemia to those involving bacterial death and release of large amounts of endotoxin. it is postulated that this shift in lethal mechanisms could account for the ability of mp to reduce mortality when used in conjunction with antibiotics. finally, since animals surviving after antibiotic treatment have significantly greater endotoxemia than those dying without such treatment and since mp does not reduce mortality in the absence of antibiotic therapy but does so if endotoxin is added to the challenge inoculum, it appears that endotoxin may not play a critical role in the pathogenesis of mortality from untreated p. mirabilis peritonitis. whether the present correlation observed between the significant rises in endotoxemia produced by antibiotics and the protection afforded by mp extends to other models of gram-negative sepsis, or to human gram-negative sepsis, is under study.

TI  == pathogenic synergy: mixed intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == in this article we review our researches into the pathogenesis of mixed infections. these may conveniently be divided into in vitro and in vivo studies.  in vitro we confirmed that interference with the killing of aerobes by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmn's) is a property of the bacteroides strains tested and appears to depend on competition for opsonins i.e. complement factors. further studies are in progress to define which complement factors and which bacterial structures are involved. the influence of b. fragilis on chemotaxis has also been studied. our preliminary data suggest that b. fragilis is itself poorly chemotactic and reduces the chemoattractivity of proteus mirabilis. this observation is surprising when we consider that abscess formation is the hall-mark of b. fragilis infections and needs clarification. in vivo we have developed a skin infection model in mice which is economical and gives reproducible and quantitative results. in this model we have demonstrated pathogenic synergy between escherichia coli and b. fragilis. further studies are  planned to assess the role of complement and bacterial factors in this in vivo synergy.

AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility tests were conducted on bacteria that were isolated  from urine specimens collected by antepubic cystocentesis from dogs with urinary  tract infections. antimicrobics to which greater than or equal to 90% of these urinary bacteria were susceptible in vitro included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smz), nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of escherichia coli; ampicillin, tmp-smz, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of proteus mirabilis; ampicillin chloramphenicol, tmp-smz, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of coagulase-positive staphylococci; cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for  isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae; ampicillin, tmp-smz, and gentamicin for isolates of streptococcus faecalis, str faecium, and str zymogenes; ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tmp-smz, and gentamicin for isolates of str viridans; and ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tmp-smz, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and  gentamicin for isolates of str canis. no antimicrobial agent tested was effective in vitro at the 90% level for isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, but gentamicin  was closest, at 89%.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial multiplication by the iron chelator deferoxamine: potentiating effect of ascorbic acid.
AB  == since iron is essential for the multiplication of microorganisms, the effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine, with or without ascorbic acid, on the growth of 43 strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, alcaligenes faecalis, neisseria meningitidis and species of salmonella, enterobacter, pseudomonas and providencia, was investigated with the use of an automated turbidimeter. addition of deferoxamine (25-400 micrograms/ml) to the incubation medium was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion. at concentrations between 200-400 micrograms/ml, growth was about 25% lower than control values. however, when ascorbic acid (100 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture medium, this antimicrobial activity of deferoxamine was significantly increased to on average 75% of the control value (p less than 0.05). ascorbic acid alone had no bacteriostatic properties. growth  in the presence of 200 micrograms/ml deferoxamine combined with 100 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid was significantly lower than that in control media without additions (p less than 0.001). addition of ferric citrate to the culture medium at a concentration sufficient to saturate all of the deferoxamine with iron, abolished the growth inhibiting effect of deferoxamine. the results provide evidence that deferoxamine is bacteriostatic due to its capacity to deplete iron  which would otherwise be used for bacterial multiplication, and that ascorbic acid enhances this antibacterial property of deferoxamine.

AB  == a total of 1,764 paired sets of bactec 6b and 16b blood culture bottles were collected from patients for analysis. the majority of the patients were receiving antibiotic therapy at the time the blood specimens were collected. a total of 126 isolates were considered clinically significant. of these, 58 grew in both 6b and 16b bottles, 25 grew only in 6b bottles, and 43 grew only in 16b bottles. in both bottles, the same amount of time was required to detect a positive culture. in 18 patients, septicemias were detected in the 16b bottles that were not detected in  the 6b bottles. in seven patients, microorganisms were detected in the 6b bottles that were not detected in the 16b bottles. interestingly, the antibiotic therapy  was changed for only 4 of the 18 patients whose septicemias were detected only in the 16b bottles. finally, an in vitro study showed that certain chemotherapeutic  agents can cause the inhibition of growth of several microorganisms when tested in 6b bottles. these inhibitory effects were reduced or eliminated when the same  organism-drug combinations were tested in 16b bottles.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and microbial susceptibility studies of ceftriaxone.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was tested  against 450 strains isolated from blood cultures and compared with that of various other antibiotics. the compound was comparable to cefotaxime for all species tested. it was more potent than cefoperazone, cefamandole and ticarcillin in inhibiting enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp. and serratia marcescens). the mic95 of ceftriaxone for these strains was 0.5 microgram/ml. the drug was less active against staphylococcus aureus than cefamandole, cloxacillin and vancomycin, but most isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftriaxone was comparable in activity to ticarcillin (mic95 = 64 micrograms/ml), and inferior to cefoperazone, ceftazidime and cefsulodine. levels of ceftriaxone in serum and various body fluids were determined by bio-assays. due to its very long half-life (8 h), ceftriaxone serum levels 24 h after i.v. or i.m. injection of 1 and 2 g were still above the mic95  of all strains tested except pseudomonas aeruginosa. levels in bile, synovial and cerebro-spinal fluids were high.

TI  == homologous sequences other than insertion elements can serve as recombination sites in plasmid drug resistance gene amplification.
AB  == a plasmid (prr983) was constructed which has a gene coding for neomycin and kanamycin resistance flanked by direct repeats of regions of homology which contain no known insertion sequences. prr983 does not have any homologous is1 sequences. growth of proteus mirabilis harboring prr983 in medium containing high concentration of neomycin resulted in cells which were highly resistant to both neomycin and kanamycin. plasmid dna was analyzed by using restriction endonucleases. in most cases the neomycin resistance gene had been tandemly duplicated by using the homologous dna sequences flanking the resistance gene as  recombination sites. this is analogous to tandem duplication of drug resistance genes on nr1 using the two direct repeats of is1 as recombination sites. the amplified plasmid dna returned to its original structure by the deletion of amplified neomycin resistance determinants when the host cells were cultured without selection for high resistance to neomycin.

AB  == the in vitro activity of e-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and  gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. e-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (mic50) of 25 micrograms for staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with streptococcus faecalis resistant. e-0702 had mic50s against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but mic90s were higher than those of the other agents. it was as active as the other  agents against proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, providencia spp., morganella spp., and proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. activity against bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. e-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. there was an inoculum effect for e. cloacae, serratia spp., morganella spp., and pseudomonas spp.

TI  == interaction of bacterial pili and leukocytes.
AB  == since duguid and guilles first described the ability of piliated bacteria to bind to leukocytes, much has been learned about the nature of this interaction. mannose-sensitive (ms) pili bind to specific mannose-containing receptors on the  leukocyte surface. while ms pili are responsible for attachment, the relative hydrophobicity of the bacterial surface determines whether the organism is internalized. both binding and ingestion trigger the leukocyte to respond with degranulation and enhanced oxidative activity. the response to piliated bacteria, however, is delayed as compared to bacteria opsonized with serum, which may account for the reduced bactericidal activity associated with pili-mediated phagocytosis. a number of factors appear to influence the significance of pili-mediated phagocytosis in vivo. these include natural selective pressures in  the host tissue, the ability of the organism to undergo pili phase transition and the presence of serum or other host opsonic factors. antipili antibody does not enhance leukocyte killing of ms + escherichia coli, but does stimulate leukocyte  metabolic activity. antipili antibody may, therefore, have an adverse effect on the infectious process by promoting the extracellular release of inflammatory material from the granulocyte.

TI  == sensitization of gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics and complement by a nontoxic oligopeptide.
AB  == a major virulence factor of bacteria that cause generalized infections is their resistance to the lytic action of the complement cascade, an important defence mechanism of the host. invasive gram-negative enteric bacteria, which cause about one-third of all bacteraemic infections, are completely resistant to lysis by complement, even in the presence of hyperimmune serum. the same bacteria are also resistant to many antibiotics that are effective therapeutic agents against other bacteria, as the outermost surface layer (the outer membrane) of the bacteria functions as a permeability barrier. here we show that it is possible to sensitize such bacteria to both complement and antibiotics by using an agent that binds to the outer membrane. this agent is a nontoxic derivative of polymyxin which by itself has no bactericidal action.

(1982) mol. gen. genet. 185, 481-486). in this paper, we report the purification to near homogeneity of the p. mirabilis reca protein (recapm). the polypeptide has a molecular weight similar to that of e. coli reca protein (recaec) and shows partial identity with recaec when reacted against antibodies specific for the e.  coli reca protein. recapm catalyzes the hydrolysis of atp in the presence of single-stranded but not double-stranded dna. we have compared the recombination-like activities of recapm with those of recaec and found them to be similar. in the presence of atp and mg2+, stoichiometric amounts of recapm promote the complete reciprocal exchange of strands between gapped circular and linear duplex dna molecules. the enzyme also efficiently promotes the formation of d-loops from circular duplex dna and homologous single-stranded fragments. however, although recapm and recaec share the above physical and functional similarities, they differ in their ability to interact with the e. coli single strand binding protein to catalyze the transfer of one dna strand from a linear duplex to a single-stranded circle.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies on t-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == t-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new 7 alpha-methoxycephem antibiotic, was fundamentally and clinically studied, and the following results were obtained. the antibacterial activities of t-1982 against clinical isolates of s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis and p. aeruginosa were determined in comparison with those of cer, cez, cmz and ctt. against s. aureus,  cer and cez exhibited excellent activity, whereas t-1982 was less active with the peak mic of 12.5 micrograms/ml even with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. the activity of t-1982 was equal to that of ctt and by far superior to that of cer, cez and cmz against e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, the peak mics with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml being less than or equal to 0.1-0.2 microgram/ml, less than or equal to 0.1-0.2 microgram/ml and 0.2-0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. against s. marcescens, t-1982 was superior to cmz and ctt and 48% of the strains were inhibited by 3.13 micrograms/ml or less, whereas  all the strains were resistant to cer and cez. the mic of t-1982 against most strains of p. aeruginosa was more than 100 micrograms/ml. 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of t-1982 was administered by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion to 23 pediatric patients to measure serum levels and urinary recovery. at 30 minutes after one shot injection of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, the highest serum levels of 22.0-38.8 micrograms/ml and 52.4-80 micrograms/ml were observed, the half-lives being 1.32 hours and 1.76 hours. when given by 1 hour drip infusion, the serum levels attained the peaks of 29.2-42.6 micrograms/ml and 49.0-75.6 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, the half-lives being 1.24 hours and 1.19 hours. the urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 74.2-92.5% and 50.2-66.5% by one shot injection and 63.4-84.2% and 53.9-79.0% by drip infusion. t-1982 was  administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg by 30 minutes drip infusion to a child with purulent meningitis. the levels of t-1982 in the cerebrospinal fluid at 1 hour after administration were 4.8-6.7 micrograms/ml with the csf/serum ratios of 4.4-8.4%. a total of 36 pediatric patients (21 cases of respiratory tract infection, 9 cases of urinary tract infection and each 1 case of purulent cervical lymphadenitis, scarlet fever, purulent meningitis, acute colitis, peritonitis and sinusitis) was treated with 40-80 mg/kg/day of t-1982 (252.6 mg/kg/day in purulent meningitis). the response was excellent in 27 patients and  good in 7 patients, the efficacy rate being 94.4%. diarrhea or eruption were observed in each 1 case. no abnormal laboratory findings were noted in any cases.

TI  == simple additives to increase the activity of chlorhexidine digluconate against urinary pathogens.
AB  == the concentration of chlorhexidine digluconate required to kill gram-negative bacteria which cause urinary tract infection associated with urethral catheterisation also damages the bladder mucosa. increased bactericidal activity  was obtained by the addition of a chelating agent (edta) and a buffer (tris) enabling a low concentration of chlorhexidine (0.01 per cent) to be effective against escherichia coli nctc 86, pseudomonas aeruginosa nctc 7650 proteus mirabilis nctc 8309 and streptococcus faecalis nctc 8213. the type of fluid in which the bacteria were suspended affected the time required to achieve 99.9 per  cent killing. the 0.01 per cent chlorhexidine solution with added edta and tris did not cause severe erosive damage to the bladder mucosa of rats. the potential  of this solution for use as a skin antiseptic prior to catheterisation and as a bladder instillation after catheterisation is discussed.

TI  == transferable antibiotic resistance in a general hospital: a two year survey.
AB  == for two years transferable antibiotic resistance (tar) was studied by replicator  methods in strains of enterobacteriaceae isolated in a 900-bed hospital. transfer to an escherichia coli recipient was demonstrated in 21% of 7,800 enterobacteriaceae. it was most common in klebsiella (37% of isolates) and least  in acinetobacter (6%). the mean number of phenotypic resistance markers (rms) transferred was higher from klebsiella pneumoniae or enterobacter cloacae than from e. coli or p. mirabilis. k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae especially transferred 7 or more rms much more often than other species. some rms were associated with a particular species, e.g. streptomycin with e. coli, kanamycin or gentamicin with  e. cloacae and kanamycin with p. mirabilis. the same was true of certain patterns of resistance transfer, e.g. ap-km and p. mirabilis, ap-sm and e. coli, ap-km-gm-tm-cm and k. pneumoniae. however, many of the commonest resistance phenotypes were transferred from several species and from several biotypes within any given species. resistance patterns transferred from e. coli were detected sporadically throughout, whereas many of those transferred from klebsiella, enterobacter or proteus were found only for a limited time.

TI  == relationship between cecal population levels of indigenous bacteria and translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes.
AB  == translocation is defined as the passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes (mln) and other organs. the  extent of translocation of certain indigenous, oxygen-tolerant bacteria from the  cecum to the mln, spleen, liver, kidney, and peritoneal cavity were determined in diassociated or triassociated gnotobiotic mice. minimal bacterial translocation occurred to the spleen, liver, kidney, or peritoneal cavity. however, most bacterial strains readily translocated to the mln. the percentage of the total population of each bacterial strain in the ceca was compared with the percentage  of the total population of that strain in the mln. there was a direct relationship between the numbers of a particular bacterial strain populating the  ceca of diassociated or triassociated mice and the numbers of viable bacteria of  this strain present in the mln. thus, the cecal population level of a particular  bacterial strain determined the numbers of viable bacteria of this strain translocating to the mln. the translocation of these bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract is an important first step in the pathogenesis of infection caused by members of the normal intestinal microflora.

TI  == evolution of complex resistance transposons from an ancestral mercury transposon.
AB  == the molecular interrelationship of a transposon family which confers multiple antibiotic resistance and is assumed to have been generated from an ancestral mercury transposon was analyzed. initially, the transposons tn2613 (7.2 kilobases), encoding mercury resistance, and tn2608 (13.5 kilobases), encoding mercury, streptomycin, and sulfonamide resistances, were isolated and their structures were analyzed. next, the following transposons were compared with respect to their genetic and physical maps: tn2613 and tn501, encoding mercury resistance; tn2608 and tn21, encoding mercury, streptomycin, and sulfonamide resistance; tn2607 and tn4, encoding streptomycin, sulfonamide, and ampicillin resistance; and tn2603, encoding mercury, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and ampicillin resistance. the results suggest that the transposons encoding multiple resistance were evolved from an ancestral mercury transposon.

TI  == biocidal braided sutures.
AB  == once sutures become contaminated it is difficult for local tissue defenses or antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria and prevent infection. impregnation of sutures with antibiotics before implantation is one way to prevent bacterial seeding of the suture surface. in this study, braided silk and dacron sutures were impregnated with the antibiotic complex, neomycin palmitate. using our standard wound model in the mouse, the efficacy of these biocidal sutures was determined in the presence of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. implantation of these biocidal sutures into tissue contaminated with 10(7) organisms resulted in substantially decreased numbers of bacteria as compared with that of tissue receiving control sutures. in most cases, the tissue bacterial counts in the presence of biocidal sutures were  also considerably lower than that for similarly contaminated tissue without a suture. consequently, the presence of the neomycin palmitate eliminated the infection-potentiating effect of the suture. the therapeutic benefit of the biocidal sutures was related to the dose of antibiotic complex and was not adversely affected by delaying suture implantation.

TI  == surgical management of benign oesophago-pleural fistula.
AB  == three cases of oesophago-pleural fistula are presented. two resulted from foreign body perforation of the oesophagus and one followed left lower lobectomy for bronchiectasis. all three presented late; the time lapse ranged from 6 days to 2  months. an initial course of conservative treatment was given to all three patients. alimentation via nasogastric tube feeding, gastrostomy or total parenteral nutrition was carried out. the pleural fluid grew the anaerobe, bacteriodies melaninogenicus, in all three cases. gram-negative aerobes, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, were also cultured. closed intercostal drainage and a course of appropriate antibiotics were instituted. the patients were subjected to surgery after the infection had been brought under control. simple repair was performed in two patients. exclusion of the oesophageal leak with drainage and later reconstruction was carried out in the third patient. although all three patients recovered, the morbidity was considerable. the duration of hospital stay ranged from 2 to 4 months.

TI  == [effect of multiresistance on the minimal inhibitory concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin and 6 comparing substances against p. aeruginosa and 4  enterobacteriaceae species].
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of multiresistant strains of p. aeruginosa and four species of enterobacteriaceae were compared with those of more sensitive ones in n-f-thienamycin and six other antibiotics. the greatest difference between these two differently resistant bacterial populations was found in cefoperazone and the beta-lactamase-instable piperacillin. the latter was used for comparison purposes. the activity of cefsulodin was distinctly reduced in multiresistant strains of p. aeruginosa. cefotaxime and lamoxactam displayed slightly elevated mics in multiresistant strains. in n-f-thienamycin a  significant difference between the multiresistant and the more sensitive population could not be verified (p greater than 0.05). in this regard it resembles fosfomycin. beta-lactam antibiotics could be ranked by means of correlation analysis of their mics. using piperacillin as a reference antibiotic  the following order of succession could be arranged according to correlation coefficients in p. aeruginosa: cefoperazone, cefsulodin, lamoxactam, cefotaxime and n-f-thienamycin. for the enterobacteriaceae species some antibiotics could not be evaluated in this test. moreover, it was recognized that there was an obvious correlation between the activities of lamoxactam and cefotaxime in p. aeruginosa (r = 0.81) and e. coli (r = 0.80). a correlation was also observed between those of cefsulodin and cefoperazone in p. aeruginosa (r = 0.75). lower correlation coefficients were seen in n-f-thienamycin with cefoperazone, piperacillin and cefsulodin in p. aeruginosa and with cefoperazone in klebsiella  spec.. notwithstanding, strains resistant to cefsulodin and cefoperazone were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml of n-f-thienamycin. these results showed that in n-f-thienamycin, cefotaxime and lamoxactam multiresistance has only a minimal influence on the mics of the species of enterobacteriaceae examined. for therapeutic considerations concerning multiresistance the small differences recognized among these three antibiotics might be without significance. however, n-f-thienamycin was distinctly more active in multiresistant strains of p. aeruginosa than the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested.

AB  == 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. the bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and group b and group d streptococci. in vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. of the 471 strains of enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. except for penicillin g, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin,  as far as its activity against p. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of norfloxacin.
AB  == norfloxacin, a new quinoline derivative, was studied in vitro, and determinations of agar dilution minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and broth dilution mics and mbcs were made. nalidixic acid and cinoxacin were used as comparative agents. norfloxacin was found to be extremely active against all strains tested of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp. serratia spp., citrobacter spp., and enterobacter spp., with mics normally below 1 microgram/ml. it also was found to be highly active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococci, which are all resistant to nalidixic acid and cinoxacin. the mics for norfloxacin obtained by broth dilution were slightly higher than those obtained by agar dilution, whereas the reverse was true for nalidixic acid and cinoxacin. the mbcs of norfloxacin were only slightly higher than the mics, even at high inocula. the in vitro activity of norfloxacin was not dependent on the inoculum size, whereas both the  mics and the mbcs of nalidixic acid increased markedly for many of the strains tested when the inoculum was increased in broth dilution from 10(3) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. norfloxacin seems to be a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of urinary tract infections, especially those caused by pseudomonas spp. and other species today requiring the use of injectable antibiotics.

TI  == a prospective microbiologic study of bacteriuria in patients with chronic indwelling urethral catheters.
AB  == bacteriuria is common in chronically catheterized patients and is associated with both acute and chronic complications. of 605 consecutive weekly urine specimens from 20 chronically catheterized patients, 98% contained bacteria at high concentrations and 77% were polymicrobial. the mean interval between new episodes of bacteriuria was 1.8 weeks. most species of bacteria caused five to seven new episodes of bacteriuria per 100 weeks of catheterization. even though access to the catheter lumen was similar, the duration of bacteriuric episodes varied greatly by species. of the episodes of bacteriuria caused by nonenterococcal gram-positive cocci, greater than 75% lasted less than one week. mean durations of episodes of bacteriuria due to escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were four to six weeks, whereas those due to providencia stuartii averaged 10 weeks and ranged up to 36 weeks. thus, the very high prevalence of bacteriuria--virtually 100%--was a result of a high incidence caused by many different species combined with the prolonged residence of some gram-negative bacilli in the catheter and urinary tract.

TI  == r-plasmid transfer in a wastewater treatment plant.
AB  == enteric bacteria have been examined for their ability to transfer antibiotic resistance in a wastewater treatment plant. resistant salmonella enteritidis, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli were isolated from clinical specimens and primary sewage effluent. resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfadiazine, and tetracycline was demonstrated by spread plate and tube dilution techniques. plasmid mediation of resistance was shown by ethidium bromide curing, agarose gel electrophoresis, and direct cell transfer. each donor was mated with  susceptible e. coli and shigella sonnei. mating pairs (and recipient controls) were suspended in unchlorinated primary effluent that had been filtered and autoclaved. suspensions were added to membrane diffusion chambers which were then placed in the primary and secondary setting tanks of the wastewater treatment plant. resistant recombinants were detected by replica plating nutrient agar master plates onto xylose lysine desoxycholate agar plates that contained per milliliter of medium 10 micrograms of ampicillin, 30 micrograms of chloramphenicol, 10 micrograms of streptomycin, 100 micrograms of sulfadiazine, or 30 micrograms of tetracycline. mean transfer frequencies for laboratory matings were 2.1 x 10(-3). in situ matings for primary and secondary settling resulted in frequencies of 4.9 x 10(-5) and 7.5 x 10(-5), respectively. these values suggest that a significant level of resistance transfer occurs in wastewater treatment plants in the absence of antibiotics as selective agents.

TI  == isolation of anaerobic organisms from kidney in serious renal infections.
AB  == we have studied 45 patients who underwent nephrectomy owing to unilateral renal sepsis for anaerobic and aerobic bacterial growth in the urine and kidney. anaerobic organisms were recovered from 11 patients: 10 had positive kidney cultures, and only 1 had positive kidney and urine cultures. there was a distinct relationship between anaerobic infection of the kidney and urinary tract obstruction; 44 per cent of the obstructed kidneys yielded anaerobic organisms versus only 11 per cent of the unobstructed kidneys. bacteroides fragilis was the anaerobic organism most often cultured. it is suggested that cultures for anaerobic organisms be performed together with aerobic cultures in patients with  symptomatic upper urinary tract infections associated with urinary obstruction. in patients in whom anaerobic infection is suspected, in spite of negative anaerobic cultures, antibiotic treatment for anaerobes should be added to the existing therapeutic measures.

TI  == [cefroxadine and cephalexin in urinary tract infections. kinetics of germ elimination].
AB  == cefroxadine and cephalexin were compared in a double-blind study in patients with complicated urinary tract infections. patients were treated orally with 1 g t.i.d. for five days. bacterial counts in the urine were determined 1, 3 and 8 hours after the first dose and on the second, third and fifth day of treatment. a decrease in the bacterial population below 10(4) organisms/ml of urine was taken  as being indicative of chemotherapeutic effect. urine specimens were inactivated  enzymatically before culture to eliminate any residual cephalosporin. a significant reduction in the bacterial count was seen one and three hours after the first dose, and, to a much greater extent, after eight hours. reduction in the bacterial count was more frequent in the group treated with cefroxadine. the  results during the first eight hours indicate that cefroxadine kills more rapidly than cephalexin, which is in agreement with the experimental findings. whether the transient differences observed in the rates of inhibition are of clinical relevance remains uncertain.

TI  == outer membrane permeation of beta-lactam antibiotics in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == mutant strains lacking outer membrane protein(s) were isolated from escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae. the outer membrane protein(s)  of p. mirabilis and e. cloacae corresponding to e. coli porin were identified on  the basis of their function, namely, their ability to allow the permeation of glucose as demonstrated by [14c]glucose uptake by intact cells. p. mirabilis has  only one outer membrane pore protein (molecular weight, 40,000), but e. cloacae has at least two such proteins (molecular weights, 37,000 and 39,000 to 40,000).  when the bacteria lost these proteins or porin, the outer membrane permeation of  cefazolin was found to be greatly reduced in these three species. such a change in the outer membrane permeation closely correlated with a significant decrease in the bacterial susceptibility to cephalosporins, including cefoxitin. these results suggested that the main pathway for cephalosporin permeation is the pore  made up of these proteins. the 39,000- to 40,000-molecular-weight protein in e. cloacae was also assumed to play an important role in the outer membrane permeation of tetracycline and chloramphenicol. on the other hand, the permeation route of penicillins was obscure. the susceptibility to penicillins, except in some cases, was little influenced by the absence of the proteins. ampicillin was  found to pass through the outer membrane via the same route as the cephalosporins, but the possibility that ampicillin and other penicillins possess another unknown route for outer membrane permeation could not be ruled out.

TI  == preliminary report comparing piperacillin and carbenicillin for complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == piperacillin is a new semisynthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of in vitro  activity against common gram-negative urinary tract pathogens. we compared the efficacy and safety of piperacillin versus carbenicillin in patients with complicated urinary tract infection. a total of 56 adult patients (mean age 55 years) in stable medical condition with 1 or more structural genitourinary abnormalities entered the study. of these patients 27 were evaluated for antibiotic efficacy. there were 20 lower tract and 7 upper tract infections, of which 17 were acute and 10 were chronic. patients were randomized into 2 groups:  17 patients with 18 organisms received single agent treatment with 181 mg. per kg. intravenous piperacillin daily for 6 days and 10 patients with 11 organisms received 270 mg. per kg. intravenous carbenicillin daily for 6 days. infecting organisms were escherichia coli 45 per cent, proteus mirabilis 14 per cent, klebsiella pneumoniae 14 per cent. enterobacter species 10 per cent, pseudomonas  aeruginosa 7 per cent and so forth. antimicrobial susceptibility assessed by measurement of minimal inhibitory concentration and disk diffusion zone size demonstrated superior activity of piperacillin over carbenicillin for most micro-organisms tested. all patients responded clinically. the bacteriologic cure rate was 72 per cent at 5 to 9 days after therapy in both groups. three patients  who received piperacillin had urosepsis and were cured. no resistance emerged during therapy. superinfections developed in 5 patients on carbenicillin (50 per  cent) and in 4 patients on piperacillin (24 per cent), and none was resistant to  piperacillin. superinfections were attributed to catheterization and structural genitourinary abnormalities. the over-all incidence of adverse effects in patients on piperacillin was less than that of those on carbenicillin, 31 and 51  per cent respectively. side effects in both groups were mild and did not require  discontinuation of therapy. there were no significant alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance, or hematologic or renal function.

TI  == phages c-2 and j: incc and incj plasmid-dependent phages, respectively.
AB  == phages c-2 and j were isolated from sewage. phage c-2 was filamentous and formed  plaques on salmonella typhimurium strains carrying various c plasmids. it also plated on proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens strains carrying particular c plasmids, but failed to form plaques on lines of escherichia coli k12 strains harbouring most of these plasmids, although in all cases, phage multiplication on the strains was demonstrated. no phage increase occurred in any strain which lacked a c plasmid or contained plasmids of other incompatibility groups. the phage was sensitive to chloroform and, unlike other filamentous bacterial viruses, adsorbed to shafts of conjugative pili. it had a disc-like structure at  the end which attached to the pilus. phage c-2 had a buoyant density of 1 . 30 g  cm-3 and a single-stranded circular dna genome of 3 . 0 mdal. phage j had an hexagonal head with an inter-apical distance of 40 nm and a short noncontractile  tail. it was resistant to chloroform and diethyl ether. the phage formed plaques  or propagated on e. coli strains harbouring some incc plasmids and all incj and incd plasmids tested. the phage did not form plaques but propagated on p. mirabilis and ser. marcescens strains carrying these plasmids. it did not plate or propagate on s. typhimurium strains harbouring the plasmids. the plaques were  very hazy and variable in size. the phage attached sparsely, at a site which appeared to be located at the base of the tail, to sides of conjugative pili.

AB  == incidence of beta-lactamase production (using the nitrocefin test and isoelectric focusing) was evaluated on 284 strains of ampicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae. production of the various beta-lactamases was correlated with the resistance to different beta-lactam antibiotics. no obvious correlation between the beta-lactamase production and the resistance pattern was found. the most striking result was the lack of beta-lactamase production in 42.6% of the strains. about 50% or more of the proteus morganii, proteus vulgaris, serratia and enterobacter strains produced no beta-lactamases, in contrast to e. coli, klebsiella, and proteus rettgeri strains which produced beta-lactamases extensively. the predominant enzyme was tem 1, while tem 2 enzyme was extremely common in proteus mirabilis and proteus rettgeri. finally, it can be concluded from our results that the production of beta-lactamases can be regarded as an important but not the sole determinant of resistance of beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == the radioactive thymidine incorporation method for the determination of antibiotic susceptibility of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the thymidine incorporation method was compared with the disc diffusion and broth dilution methods for determining the antibiotic susceptibility of escherichia coli (233 strains), proteus mirabilis (72 strains) and klebsiella species (189 strains). the method measures changes in the rate of dna synthesis of bacterial strains exposed to an antibiotic by comparing the amount of radioactive thymidine incorporated by these strains in relation to control strains. good agreement was  obtained between the results of the thymidine incorporation and disc diffusion methods for all antibiotics tested except streptomycin and tetracycline. minimal  inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics determined by the thymidine incorporation method after 3 and 5 hours were generally lower than those obtained after 24 hours by the conventional broth dilution procedure. the thymidine incorporation method may be potentially useful for determining the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria a few hours after inoculation of a clinical specimen.

TI  == rosanilins: indicator dyes for chloramphenicol-resistant enterobacteria containing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.
AB  == rosanilin dyes such as crystal violet and basic fuchsin have been used as indicator dyes in solid growth medium for chloramphenicol-resistant enterobacterial colonies containing the enterobacterial resistance enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat). on certain media containing rosanilins,  cells containing cat formed darker colonies than cells not containing cat. contrast was affected by the types and concentrations of complex nutrients, sugars salts, and rosanilin dyes present. when crystal violet was used as the indicator dye, contrast could not be obtained for strains whose growth was partially inhibited by crystal violet. contrast could not be obtained between yeast colonies with and without the enterobacterial resistance enzyme, between bacillus subtilis colonies with and without the staphylococcal resistance enzyme, or between enterobacterial colonies with and without the staphylococcal resistance enzyme. the darker coloration of enterobacterial colonies with the enterobacterial enzyme was due to the binding of dye to enzyme. rosanilin dues have been used to score resistance phenotypes by colony color, to detect chloramphenicol-sensitive sectors in chloramphenicol-resistant colonies, and to screen for occasional chloramphenicol-sensitive cells in a resistant population during cloning by insertional inactivation of the chloramphenicol resistance gene.

TI  == analysis of the disagreement between automated bioluminescence-based and culture  methods for detecting significant bacteriuria, with proposals for standardizing evaluations of bacteriuria detection methods.
AB  == a fully automated method for detecting significant bacteriuria is described which uses firefly luciferin and luciferase to detect bacterial atp in urine. the automated method was calibrated and evaluated, using 308 urine specimens, against two reference culture methods. we obtained a specificity of 0.79 and sensitivity  of 0.75 using a quantitative pour plate reference test and a specificity of 0.79  and a sensitivity of 0.90 using a semiquantitative standard loop reference test.  the majority of specimens negative by the automated test but positive by the pour plate reference test were specimens which grew several bacterial species. we suggest that such disagreement was most likely for urine containing around 10(5)  colony-forming units per ml (the culture threshold of positivity) and that these  specimens were ones contaminated by urethral or vaginal flora. we propose standard procedures for calibrating and evaluating rapid or automated methods for the detection of significant bacteriuria and have analyzed our results using these procedures. we recommend that identical analyses should be reported for other evaluations of bacteriuria detection methods.

AB  == the mics of amoxicillin, mezlocillin and brl 25,000, a combination of two parts amoxicillin and one part clavulanic acid (2am + 1ca), were measured for 331 enterobacteriaceae strains which produced beta-lactamases as demonstrated by nitrocefin. the mic values for mezlocillin and the combination 2am + 1ca were very similar for the total number of the strains investigated. when investigated  separately according to the bacterial species, three different sensitivity groups were established for the above-mentioned preparations: 1) species with the same or similar sensitivity to mezlocillin and 2am + 1ca (escherichia coli and shigella spp., amoxicillin-resistant strains); 2) species which were more sensitive to mezlocillin than to the combination 2am + 1ca (citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp. and indole-positive proteus as well as strains of e. coli and shigella spp. which produce a cephalosporinase and are sensitive to amoxicillin); 3) species which are more sensitive to 2am + 1ca than  to mezlocillin (amoxicillin-resistant salmonella spp., proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae). this complementary activity of mezlocillin and 2am + 1ca  against enterobacteriaceae depended on the beta-lactamases produced.

TI  == an assessment of the intramuscular and intravenous administration of mezlocillin  in urinary tract infections.
AB  == the efficacy of mezlocillin in urinary tract infections was assessed using both the intramuscular and intravenous route. patients with comparable diseases were divided into two groups. the microorganisms were sensitive to mezlocillin. thirty patients were given i. m. doses and 20 i. v. doses. these patients had upper or lower urinary tract infections. the doses were 2 g i. v. or 1 g i. m. every eight hours. treatment lasted for an average of six days. the mics for mezlocillin were determined for the strains isolated, all of which were gram-negative organisms, with the exception of nine enterococci. in addition, sensitivity to cephalothin,  carbenicillin and gentamicin was determined using the disc diffusion test. the geometric means of the mics for mezlocillin were 3.85, 2.8 and 1.3 mg/l against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and enterococci, respectively. there were no  marked differences in activity between the i. m. and i. v. routes on days 1, 7, 14, 30 and 60 after treatment. there was a short-term cure rate of 79% with mezlocillin, independent of the route of administration; reinfections were observed in 8% of the cases and the infection persisted in 13%. there are no significant differences between our results and those from other studies on mezlocillin and piperacillin. there was no indication of toxicity, nor were there deviations in the haematological and biochemical parameters. one patient had severe pruritus following each i. m. injection; the treatment had to be discontinued.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of daunorubicin and adriamycin derivatives on bacterial  and protoplast type l-form cells of bacillus subtilis 170, escherichia coli b, and proteus mirabilis vi. structure--activity relationship.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of ten n-alkylated derivatives of daunorubicin and adriamycin as well as of 5-iminodaunorubicin has been tested by using bacillus subtilis 170, escherichia coli b, and proteus mirabilis vi and their stable protoplast type l-forms in an agar diffusion test. eight of the substances showed similar activities against b. subtilis and the l-forms of all test organisms, but no activity against the bacterial forms of e. coli and p. mirabilis. the cell wall of these gram-negative bacteria is responsible for this resistance by not allowing the antibiotics to enter the cells. the piperidino compound n-(ch2)5 daunorubicin shows 2-4 times higher activity against b. subtilis and all l-forms  in comparison to daunorubicin and the other derivatives. five of the substances were inactive against all test strains. their inactivity seems to be associated with the larger substituents at the c-3' position. relations between molecular structure and activity are discussed considering data about the interaction with  dna and the antitumor activity. stable protoplast type l-forms and their bacterial forms represent a suitable and effective test system to screen for more effective substances and to get more information about their mode of action.

TI  == the inhibition of beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria by clavulanic acid.
AB  == the beta-lactamase from klebsiella pneumoniae e70 behaved in a similar fashion to the tem-2 plasmid mediated enzyme on reaction with clavulanic acid. both enzymes  produced two types of enzyme-clavulanate complex, a transiently stable species (t((1/2))=4min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c) and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. in the initial rapid reaction (2.5min) the enzymes partitioned between the transient and irreversible complexes in the ratios 3:1 for tem-2 beta-lactamase and 1:1 for klebsiella beta-lactamase. biphasic inactivation was observed for both enzymes and the slower second phase was rate limited by the decay of the transiently stable complex. this decay released free enzyme for further reaction with fresh clavulanic acid, the products again partitioning between transiently stable and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. this cycle continued until all the enzyme had been irreversibly inhibited. a 115 molar excess of inhibitor was required to achieve complete inactivation of tem-2 beta-lactamase. hydrolysis of clavulanic acid with product release appeared to occur with the inhibition reaction, which explained this degree of clavulanic acid turnover. the stoichiometry of the interaction with klebsiella beta-lactamase was not examined. the penicillinase from proteus mirabilis c889 was rapidly inhibited by low concentrations of clavulanic acid. the major product was a moderately stable complex (t((1/2))=40min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c); the proportion of the enzyme that was irreversibly inactivated was small. the cephalosporinase from enterobacter cloacae p99 had low affinity for the inhibitor and only reacted with high concentrations of clavulanic acid (k=4.0m(-1).s(-1)) to produce a relatively stable complex (t((1/2))=180min at ph7.3 and 37 degrees c). no irreversible inactivation of this enzyme was detected. the rates of decay of the clavulanate-enzyme complexes produced in reactions with proteus and enterobacter enzymes were markedly increased at acid ph.

TI  == an evaluation of tests using dna repair-deficient bacteria for predicting genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. a report of the u.s. epa's gene-tox program.
AB  == the detection of dna-damaging agents by repair-deficient bacterial assays is based on the differential inhibition of growth of repair-proficient and repair-deficient bacterial pairs. the various methodologies used are described and recommendations are made for their improved use. in a survey of the literature through april 1979, 91 of 276 papers evaluated contained usable data,  resulting in an analysis of 611 compounds that had been assayed in 1 or more of 55 pairs of repair-proficient and repair-deficient strains. the results indicate  that (1) a liquid suspension assay is more sensitive than a spot (diffusion) test. in a review of the escherichia coli pola assay, 45 compounds that gave "no  test" in the spot test were clearly positive or negative in the liquid suspension assay. (2) of the 21 compounds analyzed by the e. coli pola assay and by other e. coli repair-deficient strains (e.g., rec, uvr, hcr, and exr derivatives of wp2 and ab1157), 10 were in complete agreement in all strains except uvra strains. this indicates that strains other than pola+/pola- are useful for detecting dna-damaging agents. however, in selecting strains for use in these assays, care  should be taken to consider repair pathway specificity for particular compounds.  (3) there was a 78% correspondence between results obtained with e. coli pola and bacillus subtilis (h17/m45, 17a/45t) rec assay and between e. coli pola and proteus mirabilis. (4) in a comparison of test results with carcinogenicity data, 44 of 71 (62%) carcinogenic compounds assayed by the pola system were positive, 10 (14%) were negative, and 17 (24%) gave no test or doubtful results. 7 carcinogens were assayed by other e. coli strains and all were positive. 56 carcinogens were assayed in b. subtilis: 24 (43%) were positive, 9 (16%) were negative, and 23 (41%) gave no test or doubtful results. of the 7 carcinogens assayed in p. mirabilis, 6 (86%) were positive and 1 (14%) was negative. (5) the  results were analyzed with respect to chemical classes. e. coli pola detected the highest percentage of hydroxylamines and alkyl epoxides. the b. subtilis rec assay detected the highest percentage of nitrosamines and sulfur and nitrogen oxides. it is concluded that some of these test systems are effective tools for the detection of dna-damaging and potentially carcinogenic compounds, especially  if the assay is done in liquid suspension and if more than 1 pair of tester strains is used. advantages and disadvantages of the assay are discussed and suggestions are made for improvements in the system.

TI  == acquired cross resistance to aminoglycosides in gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant strains of enterobacteria.
AB  == the development of non-specific resistance ot gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin was studied in 12 clinical isolates of enterobacteria with various patterns of aminoglycoside resistance. strains were characterised with respect to mic, transferability of resistance and possession of acetylating and adenylylating enzymes. an increase in aminoglycoside resistance was induced in 10 strains by a  single exposure to the concentration of gentamicin, tobramycin or amikacin immediately below the mic. such resistance was non-specific; all three aminoglycosides were affected irrespective of which one had been used to induce the increase. increments in non-specific aminoglycoside resistance were also evoked by exposure of enterobacteria to changing drug concentrations similar to those achieved in plasma during therapy. when strains already resistant to gentamicin or other aminoglycosides were exposed to therapeutically achievable drug concentrations, no further increase in resistance was observed in most cases. this suggests that use of an aminoglycoside to which the organism is resistant, as during "blind" therapy, will not usually compromise subsequent treatment with related antibiotics. the possible relevance of non-specific aminoglycoside resistance to therapy is discussed.

AB  == the amino acid of the lipooligopeptide (lop) derived from the n-terminal region of the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (pal) of proteus mirabilis was determined to be [x]-ser-ser-asn-lys. an unidentified compound[x] present at the  n-terminus was identified as glycerylcysteine [s-(propane-2,'3'-diol)-3-thio, 2-amino-propanoic acid]. the partial amino acid sequence of the lipopolypeptide (lpp), which contained the lipooligopeptide (lop) at its n-terminal part, was also determined, mainly by edman-degradation. the structure of the n-terminal part of pal was determined to be [3 fatty acids approximately glycerylcysteine-ser-ser-asn-lys-asn-asp-asp-glu-thr-asp-thr-ser...]. the structure of pal is discussed in comparison with braun's lipoprotein.

TI  == structure of the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (pal) of the proteus mirabilis outer membrane. i. isolation and characterization of fatty acid-containing peptides from pal.
AB  == in the outer membrane of p. mirabilis, a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (pal) of apparent molecular weight 18,000 is present as a major protein. a fatty  acid-containing polypeptide (lipopolypeptide; lpp) was isolated by digestion of the purified pal with trypsin in the presence of 0.05% sds. it was composed of 31 amino acid residues, an unidentified compound[x], and ca. 3 fatty acid residues.  a lipooligopeptide (lop) was also isolated after further digestion of lpp with trypsin in the absence of sds. lop was composed of 4 amino acid residues (asx, 2ser, lys), a compound[x], and ca. 3 fatty acid residues. the c-terminal amino acids of lpp and lop were determined as arginine and lysine, respectively. on the other hand, the n-terminus of pal, lpp, or lop could not be identified by conventional n-terminal analysis of pal, lpp, or lop could not be identified by conventional n-terminal analysis, indicating that the n-terminus is probably masked. these results indicate that lpp and lop are derived from the fatty-attached amino terminal region of pal.

TI  == a novel peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (pal) found in the outer membrane of proteus mirabilis and other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a novel peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (pal) was found in the cell envelope of proteus mirabilis. this protein showed the following properties: (1) the apparent molecular weight in sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) polyacrylamide gel was  18,000. (2) the protein was present in the cell envelope in a form very closely,  but not covalently, associated with the peptidoglycan layer. (3) the protein was  recovered predominantly from the outer membrane fraction after separation of the  cell envelopes. (4) [1-14c]palmitic acid and [2-3h]glycerol were incorporated into the protein. (5) the protein contained covalently linked fatty acids (about  3 mol of fatty acid per mol of protein). (6) an unidentified compound was present in the hydrolysate of the protein. these properties, except for molecular weight  and non-covalent association with the peptidoglycan, showed resemblance to those  of braun's lipoprotein. however the protein was distinct from braun's lipoprotein in regard to amino acid composition. a similar peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (pal) was present widely in the cell envelopes of various gram-negative bacteria. p. mirabilis contains about twelve times as much pal as escherichia coli. antiserum against pal of p. mirabilis was cross-reactive against pal of e. coli, but not against braun's lipoprotein of e. coli.

AB  == the effects of combining the new broad-spectrum penicillins piperacillin and mezlocillin with cefoxitin, cefamandole, or cephalothin on the antibacterial activities of these antibodies were determined in vitro against 50 to 109 bacterial strains and in six experimental infections in mice. against strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, salmonella, acinetobacter, enterococcus, and staphylococcus, the combinations exhibited synergistic, indifferent, or additive effects, but no antagonism. against strains of four groups of organisms (pseudomonas, serratia, enterobacter, and indole-positive proteus), a high incidence of antagonism was observed, particularly with combinations containing cefoxitin (60 to 100%). the penicillins were antagonized  by the cephalosporin antibiotics. in vitro effects were reflected in vivo. mice infected with cultures associated with synergistic or additive in vitro effects were protected with lower doses of piperacillin when this antibiotic was administered with ineffective doses of cefoxitin than when piperacillin was used  alone. infections with cultures associated with in vitro antagonism required two- to eightfold higher doses of piperacillin and mezlocillin when these antibiotics  were used in combination with the cephalosporins. the clinical implications of these effects should be considered.

TI  == a comparison of cefaclor versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination in the  treatment of acute urinary infections.
AB  == acute lower urinary tract infections were treated in 57 women according to a randomized protocol, using either cefaclor, a cephalosporin whose chemical structure is similar to that of cephalexin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination. urine cultures were made before treatment was started, midway through the 10-day course of therapy, 1 week after therapy and 4 to 6 weeks after therapy, if possible. urine cultures in 100 per cent of the patients became sterile during therapy and remained so 1 week after therapy. of those patients undergoing followup cultures 4 to 6 weeks after therapy 98 per cent had sterile urine. twenty-nine patients were randomized to cefaclor therapy and 28 received a trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination. there was no difference between the 2  drugs studied in terms of efficacy. no side effects were noted with cefaclor and  2 minor side effects were noted with the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination. cefaclor in a twice daily dosage schedule appears to be a safe and useful drug in the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by the common gram-negative organisms and it appears to be as efficacious as the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination.

TI  == papillary necrosis in vitro: a scanning electron microscopic comparison of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis infection.
AB  == the effect of bacterial infection on excised renal papillae as a model for papillary necrosis and subsequent calcification was investigated. sterile rat renal papillae were placed in 25 ml aliquots of filter sterilized human urine and then inoculated with one ml suspensions of sterilized human urine and then inoculated with one ml suspensions of sterile saline as a control, or 1 x 108/ml  escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis. after incubation at 37 degrees c for periods of 8 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr, 1 wk, 2 wk and 3 wk, urinary ph was measured, bacterial culture performed and the renal papillae were recovered and examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem) and energy dispersive spectrophotometry (eds). in the case of proteus mirabilis, the sequence of events noted included bacterial-papillary interactions consisting of cell desquamation and strand formation, despite infrequent bacterial attachment. after 10 hr, a rapid, urease induced ph rise resulted in calcium salt deposition on the papillae surface. organism death was apparent after 72 hr. escherichia coli infected papillae demonstrated similar cell surface changes after a 8 hr as seen in p. mirabilis; however, frequent evidence of bacterial attachment and penetration was apparent. bacterial attachment was a prominent feature throughout the incubation  period with e. coli. after one week, rare areas of degenerating cells and bacteria with increased calcium levels as compared to surrounding areas were noted by eds analysis. urinary ph was stable throughout the incubation period. this study suggests varied roles for the organisms most associated with infection induced papillary necrosis (e coli) and papillary necrosis with subsequent stone  formation (p. mirabilis). a role for bacterial calcification in the absence of bacterial urease activity by e. coli is also suggested.

TI  == hemagglutination of human type o erythrocytes, hemolysin production, and serogrouping of escherichia coli isolates from patients with acute pyelonephritis, cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to study potential virulence factors associated with escherichia coli urinary pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infection. these factors were compared with characteristics of normal-flora e. coli isolated from stool specimens of healthy individuals without a history of urinary tract infection. the potential virulence factor focused on in this study was hemagglutination (ha) of human type o erythrocytes by e. coli urinary pathogens. a total of 265 strains of e. coli isolated from patients with  urinary tract infections were tested for their ability to hemagglutinate human type o erythrocytes; of these, 148 (56%) were ha positive. only 6 of 36 fecal e.  coli strains (17%) isolated from healthy controls were ha positive. this significant association of the presence of hemagglutinin on e. coli that causes urinary tract infections indicates the likelihood that ha is a marker of virulence. only 12% (5 of 43) of proteus mirabilis and 3% (3 of 104) of klebsiella pneumoniae urinary isolates were ha positive. there was a trend for ha-positive e. coli to be isolated from patients with kidney infections and positive tests for antibody-coated bacteria rather than bladder infections and negative tests for antibody-coated bacteria, although the difference was not statistically significant. there was a significant correlation (p < 0.025) between hemolysin production and ha; 67% (69 of 103) of the isolates that produced hemolysin also hemagglutinated human type o erythrocytes. there was no significant correlation between ha and motility, although there was a trend for flagellated organisms to be non-hemagglutinators. there was a marked correlation  between the presence of hemagglutinin and the serogroup of the e. coli isolate; serogroups o4, o7, and o50 were almost always ha positive (57 of 63; 90%). in contrast, serogroups o8 and o25 were rarely ha positive (2 of 30; 7%).

TI  == evaluation of cefaclor.
AB  == the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, bacterial spectrum, clinical use,  dosage, adverse reactions, and dosage forms and cost of cefaclor are reviewed. cefaclor, a congener of cephalexin monohydrate, is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic. it is well absorbed when given orally on an empty stomach; absorption is delayed by the presence of food. although metabolism may play a role in the disposition of cefaclor, elimination is primarily renal. cefaclor's spectrum of activity is similar to that of cefalexin, including a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria; in particular, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., and haemophilus influenzae are more susceptible to clinically achievable concentrations of cefaclor than cephalexin. cefaclor has been demonstrated to be effective against  beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae resistant to ampicillin, but further studies are needed to establish the clinical significance of this activity. efficacy of cefaclor has been demonstrated in urinary tract, upper and lower respiratory tract, and skin and soft tissue infections in adults and children as  well as in pediatric otitis media. adverse reactions, mostly gastrointestinal, are generally mild and occur in few patients. usual doses are 250-500 mg every eight hours in adults and 20--40 mg/kg/day in children, although this pediatric dose may be two low for otitis media. clinical superiority of cefaclor over less  expensive antibiotics has not been demonstrated.

AB  == a comparison has been made of the activity of three antiseptics that are used as  bladder irrigants in the treatment of urinary tract infection in catheterised patients. at the concentrations and exposure times used for bladder irrigation, phenoxyethanol (2:4% v/v) proved to be highly bactericidal against urine-grown cells of all the common urinary pathogens tested. chlorhexidine (200 microgram/ml) was active against escherichia coli and produced significant reductions in the viability of klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa but failed to eradicate providencia stuartii. exposure to  noxythiolin (2.5% v/v) for 20 min had little effect in any of the bacteria, even  though all strains tested had been recorded as noxythiolin-sensitive by conventional plate sensitivity tests. contact with noxythiolin for periods of at  least 1-2 hrs was necessary before extensive bactericidal activity was detected.  these results provide an explanation of the poor clinical performance of noxythiolin that we have observed.

TI  == postantibiotic suppression of bacterial growth.
AB  == persistent suppression of bacterial growth following exposure of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to numerous antimicrobial agents was studied. the persistent, or postantibiotic, effect was quantitated by periodic counts of colony-forming units after removal of the drug by washing, dilution, or inactivation with penicillinase. although a postantibiotic effect was observed with all drugs studied, there were marked differences among drugs in their postantibiotic effects on certain organisms. with gram-positive organisms, concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics near the minimal inhibitory concentration produced persistent effects lasting 1-3 hr. with gram-negative organisms much higher concentrations were required to elicit a postantibiotic effect. inhibitors of protein and rna synthesis produced the longest persistent suppression of growth, which was of comparable duration in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. only a short persistent effect of gentamicin was observed with staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, but a postantibiotic effect lasting 1.6-2.6 hr was observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa. the duration of the  postantibiotic effect was related linearly to concentration of drug and duration  of exposure up to a point of maximal response. persistent effects following exposure to antibiotics were also demonstrated in 90% human serum.

TI  == comparison of mezlocillin and carbenicillin as therapy for various infectious diseases.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of mezlocillin, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic penicillin, were compared with those of carbenicillin in a nonblind, controlled clinical study in 89 adult patients. the infections treated were primarily those  of the urinary tract, skin, and gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary tract. escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the causative organisms isolated most frequently. a complete resolution of signs and symptoms was achieved in 78% of the mezlocillin patients and in 71% of  the carbenicillin patients. in the mezlocillin group, causative organisms were eliminated in 80% of the courses, and in the carbenicillin group the elimination  rate was 86%. two adverse reactions, rash and diarrhea, were reported in mezlocillin-treated patients; none were reported for the carbenicillin group.

TI  == adhesion of escherichia coli in urinary tract infection.
AB  == in individuals prone to urinary tract infections the intestine is colonized by e. coli strains that possess a combination of properties determining virulence. such an e. coli strain may colonize the vaginal and periurethral area and ascend the urinary tract. the ability to attach to the mucosal surface is thought to be essential for e. coli to colonize and to remain in the urinary tract. most e. coli from patients with urinary tract infection show one or both of two adherence properties. one may depend on the recognition by type 1 fimbriae of mannose-containing residues in the urinary slime. it is measured as mannose-sensitive haemagglutination and is found on most e. coli strains. the second adherence property is detected as attachment to human urinary tract epithelial cells and as mannose-resistant agglutination of human erythrocytes. this may depend on the recognition of globo-series glycolipids in the epithelial  cell surface. possession of this adherence factor is strongly related to virulence. most strains from patients with acute pyelonephritis and cystitis have this property but it is rare in strains from patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria and strains from normal faeces. local antibodies may interfere with bacterial attachment, thus possibly preventing the colonization that precedes urinary tract infection or modifying an established infection. vaginal antibodies are known to coat e. coli from the stools. antibodies in the urine of patients with acute pyelonephritis inhibit attachment of the infecting strain to uroepithelial cells. antibodies directed against several bacterial surface structures, for example o antigen and fimbriae, are likely to inhibit attachment  by steric hindrance or agglutination. the role of antibodies in adhesion-mediating structure such as fimbriae in susceptibility to and the outcome of human urinary tract infection remains to be investigated.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a, a derivative of fortimicin a.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a (odmf), a derivative of fortimicin a, was compared with those of fortimicin a and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. all three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus, with odmf most active against proteus mirabilis,  indole-positive proteus, and providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. activity of each of the antibiotics against group d streptococci was poor. the overall activity of odmf was superior to that of fortimicin a for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. both odmf and fortimicin a were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the  exception of 3-n-acetyltransferase-i. odmf and fortimicin a showed similar rapid  bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin g. the combination of carbenicillin with odmf, fortimicin a, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested. inactivation of odmf and fortimicin a when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. odmf, fortimicin a, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, s. aureus, or p. aeruginosa. gentamicin was the most active, followed by odmf and fortimicin a. the superior in vitro activity of odmf compared with fortimicin a against p. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.

TI  == single-disk diffusion testing (kirby-bauer) of susceptibility of proteus mirabilis to chloramphenicol: significance of the intermediate category.
AB  == the significance of the intermediate category of the single-disk diffusion test (kirby-bauer) of antibiotic susceptibility has never been clearly defined. thirty-two percent of 756 clinical isolates of proteus mirabilis were of intermediate susceptibility to chloramphenicol, a higher percentage than for any  other species. the breakpoint separating susceptible and intermediate isolates nearly bisected the frequency distribution of zone diameters of p. mirabilis but  not that of the other species. the breakpoint separating susceptible and intermediate isolates nearly bisected the frequency distribution of zone diameters of p. mirabillis but not that of the other species tested. by serial broth dilution testing, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chloramphenicol of 50 individual isolates of p. mirabilis were 3.9 to 22.1 micrograms/ml (geometric mean, 8.0), whereas the mics of susceptible escherichia  coli, klebsiella, and enterobacter strains were 2.0 to 3.9 micrograms/ml (geometric mean, 2.9). seventy percent of isolates of p. mirabilis with mics of 7.8 to 15.6 micrograms/ml were classified as susceptible by disk testing. we conclude that existing kirby-bauer breakpoints do not accurately discriminate p.  mirabilis isolates that are marginally susceptible to chloramphenicol. these data underscore the difficulty of applying a single set of breakpoints to all species  and suggest that species-specific breakpoints would more accurately predict the mic equivalent of given zone diameters.

AB  == n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin g, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. all of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. more than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of staphylococcus aureus and 80% of s. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by n-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. it inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than  ticarcillin. all 16 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. the marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it  a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == an experimental model for ascending acute pyelonephritis caused by escherichia coli or proteus in rats.
AB  == experimental, ascending acute pyelonephritis in rats was produced by injecting 0  x 5 ml of 10(9) bacteria/ml into the urinary bladder via the urethra. no traumatic manipulation of the ureters of kidneys was necessary. a grading system  for kidney lesions based on macro- and microscopical examination was used. the capacity of different escherichia coli and proteus strains to induce acute pyelonephritis was tested, and the e. coli 06k13h1 strain and the proteus mirabilis 03h1 strain were especially capable of causing urinary tract infection. for the p. mirabilis 03h1 strain, a dominance of right kidney lesions was noted in contrast to the e. coli 06k13h1 strain which did not show any side preference.

TI  == boron-containing antibacterial agents: effects on growth and morphology of bacteria under various culture conditions.
AB  == the effects of a number of synthetic antibacterial agents of the borinic acid and diazaborine types on the growth of enteric bacteria were examined. in minimal medium aerobic growth was immediately slowed; slow nonexponential growth continued for an extended period, and the cells remained viable. the effect was also seen in anaerobic cultures and was not antagonized by a number of common nutrients, vitamins, or growth factors. the response was modified by the addition of casein hydrolysate to the medium. this seemed to be a nutritional effect dependent principally on lysine and leucine. the modified response consisted of a period of abnormal growth lasting for at least one doubling time after the addition of the antibacterial agent. the turbidity at first increased more rapidly than that of the controls and was approximately equal to that of the controls after 30 min. however, the increase in bacterial mass (dry weight) was only 0.75 of the amount predicted by the change in turbidity. the viable count increased in proportion to the turbidity. changes in the cell envelope were revealed by electron microscopy and by an alteration in the response of cells to  lytic agents. after the period of abnormal growth cultures entered a premature stationary phase.

TI  == cefamandole treatment of pulmonary infection caused by gram-negative rods.
AB  == the increasing incidence of pneumonia caused by h. influenza and the problem of beta lactamase production (18% of strains in recent reports) are important considerations in the therapy of pneumonia. an antibiotic that is effective for these strains and other common respiratory pathogens will be useful for the therapy of pneumonia. cefamandole nafate is a new cephalosporin antibiotic with an antimicrobial spectrum similar to cephalothin with increased activity against  escherichia coli, proteus spp., enterobacter spp., and haemophilus influenzae. seventeen patients with pneumonia presumed to be due to susceptible gram-negative organisms isolated from transtracheal aspirate or sputum were treated with 6 to 8 g/day of parenteral cefamandole nafate. organisms isolated were haemophilus influenzae in 6, e. coli in 3, proteus mirabilis in 2, klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, serratia marcescens in 1 and mixed gram-negative rods in 4. the serratia were  resistant (mic greater than 100 microgram/ml and 50 microgram/ml): other mic's ranged from 0.2 to 6.2 microgram/ml; median 1.6 microgram/ml. satisfactory clinical response (improvement in pulmonary function; resolution of infiltrate; decrease in temperature, sputum production and white count) was noted in 13 of 17 patients. two patients died from their underlying disease. adverse clinical reactions questionably related to cefamandole included sgot rises in 3 and rash in one. serum antibiotic levels were 22.0 to 88.0 microgram/ml (peak) and 1.1 to  12.5 microgram/ml (trough). sputum levels were 0.27 to 2.5 microgram/ml. cefamandole appears to be an effective antibiotic for treatment of gram-negative  pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms.

AB  == three cephalosporins with 7-(2-hydroxyiminophenylacetamido) side chains (sk&f 79433, 80000 and 80303), differing in their 3-substituents, exhibited similar broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against strains of staphylococcus  aureus, streptococcus faecalis and various gram-negative bacilli. all three were  active in vivo (s.c., mouse) against s. aureus, escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae, but they differed significantly in serum pharmacokinetic profiles. sk&f 80303 produced high and extremely prolonged serum levels and protected mice  when administered up to 24 hours prior to challenge with beta-lactamase-producing s. aureus or k. pneumoniae. it was resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases from s. aureus, and variably so to beta-lactamases from e. coli strains. sk&f 80303 was bacteriolytic to logarithmically growing s. aureus, e. coli, proteus mirabilis, k. pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae (partially). sk&f 80303 illustrates further the effect of the 3-sulfoalkyltetrazole substituent on the pharmacokinetic properties of cephalosporins. its combined biological properties  make it a possible candidate for therapeutic and long-term prophylactic use.

TI  == effect of long-term tetracycline exposure (drinking water additive) on antibiotic-resistance of aerobic gram-negative intestinal flora of rats.
AB  == a study was undertaken to determine the effect of 2 years of intermittent administration of tetracycline in drinking water on antibiotic resistance in the  aerobic gram-negative enterobacteria of rats in a closed colony. the bacterial isolates examined were resistant to tetracycline and streptomycin. minimal inhibitory concentrations of tetracycline and streptomycin for intestinal organisms were similar in all of the animals, regardless of whether the animals were sampled while they were given drinking water with added tetracycline or at intervals of 3, 8, and 9 months after the antibiotic was no longer added to the drinking water. biochemical examination of the isolates from each principal showed that escherichia coli was the predominant enteric organism. in conjugation experiments, all e coli and klebsiella pneumoniae isolated transferred tetracycline and streptomycin resistance to an e coli k-12 recipient. four different strains of rats that had not been treated with tetracycline (controls)  were examined for tetracycline resistance. tetracycline-resistant proteus mirabilis was isolated from the intestines of these animals. plasmid-mediated resistance could not be demonstrated. the e coli and p vulgaris isolates from these control animals were susceptible to tetracycline.

TI  == secretory iga does not enhance the bacteriostatic effects of iron-binding or vitamin b12-binding proteins in human colostrum.
AB  == human milk contains an unsaturated iron-binding protein (lactoferrin) and an unsaturated vitamin b12-binding protein. lactoferrin has bacteriostatic properties, and a bacteriostatic role for the b12-binding protein has been postulated. in this study the bacteriostatic effect of lactoferrin was confirmed  for strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas and proteus. growth inhibition attributable to the unsaturated b12-binding protein could be demonstrated only with a known vitamin b12-dependent e. coli. it has previously been shown that the bacteriostatic effect of lactoferrin is potentiated by horse igg antibody, and a  similar potentiating effect of secretory iga antibody in colostrum and milk would have obvious importance. an attempt was therefore made to demonstrate potentiation of bacteriostatic effects by naturally occurring secretory iga antibody to e. coli. the results obtained indicate that secretory iga antibody does not enhance the growth-inhibiting effects of either lactoferrin or the vitamin b12-binding protein.

TI  == requirements of immunoglobulin and the classical and alternative complement pathways for phagocytosis and intracellular killing of multiple strains of gram-negative aerobic bacilli.
AB  == the requirements for immunoglobulin and the alternative and classical complement  pathways for phagocytosis and intracellular killing of clinical isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens by normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were determined. human sera deficient in immunoglobulin or classical pathway activity, or both, were compared for their ability to promote phagocytosis os and killing of 13 bacterial strains by the polymorphonuclear leukocytes. seven of the thirteen microorganisms required immunoglobulin for phagocytosis and killing and utilized only the classical complement pathway. three required immunoglobulin and utilized both the classical and alternative pathways. the other three microorganisms required minimal immunoglobulin and utilized the alternative or classical pathway, or both. none of the microorganisms utilized the alternative pathway in immunoglobulin-deficient sera or could be forced to utilize this pathway in sera  deficient in both immunoglobulin and classical pathway activity. these results demonstrated a heterogeneity in the requirements for immunoglobulin and the alternative and classical complement pathways for phagocytosis and intracellular  killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes among various genera of gram-negative aerobic bacilli, as well as among strains of the same species. in addition, the results suggested that a mechanism of classical pathway activation dependent upon minimal immunoglobulin participates in phagocytosis and intracellular killing of  certain gram-negative aerobic bacilli.

TI  == lethal effect of complement and lysozyme on polymyxin-treated, serum-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == when genetically serum-resistant escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and citrobacter freundii, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa or proteus mirabilis, were exposed to polymyxin b, they became susceptible to the bactericidal action of normal human and rabbit sera. in constrast, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics did not render any serum-resistant bacteria serum-sensitive. synergy  between polymyxin b and the serum bactericidal system could be demonstrated by the addition of polymyxin b to bacteria in vitro, as well as to bacilli in serum  from rabbits injected with the antibiotic. polymyxin b-treated bacteria were killed by normal, lysozyme-depleted, c2-deficient, and hypogammaglobulinemic sera, but not by heated or c6-deficient sera. these findings indicate that polymyxin b-treated bacteria can be killed via the alternative complement pathway. however, c3 and c3b were detected on the surface of serum-resistant e. coli, regardless of whether the bacteria had been treated with polymyxin b. this  observation suggests that a change in susceptibility to the alternative complement pathway was not the only explanation for the acquired serum sensitivity. polymyxin b may also affect a step in the complement sequence beyond the activation of c3, a step that is apparently blocked in serum-resistant gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == the antibacterial effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-mics) of antibiotics were studied in two animal models. in mice, the oral cephalosporin cgp 9000 was effective in 11 of 20 different gram-negative infections and cephalexin was effective in one of these infections, both at 50% effective doses  (ed(50)) that produced peak concentrations of drug in plasms equal to one-half to one-sixteenth the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) for the infecting organism. in gram-positive infections, both antibiotics were effective only at concentrations above the mic. in rabbits, sub-mics of cephaloridine, ampicillin,  and gantamicin were maintained for 6-10 hr by intravenous infusion. at steady-state concentrations equal to one half to one-eighth the mic, the beta-lactam antibiotics caused elongation and filamentation, and gentamicin caused enlargement, of proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and salmonella typhimurium in peritoneal exudate; the number of viable cells of each of these bacteria was temporarily reduced. in infections with e. coli and p. mirabilis, sub-mic's of beta-lactam antibiotics and of gentamicin prolonged the survival rates for infected animals beyond those for control animals. rabbits infected with s. typhimurium and treated with ampicillin at a concentration of one-third the mic tended to die sooner than did control animals.

AB  == three piliated bacterial species were exposed to ultraviolet light (7 x 10(3) microw/cm2), and the effect of increasing duration of irradiation on the integrity of the somatic pili was quantitated by negative-stain electron microscopy. heavily piliated proteus mirabilis became devoid of pili after 20 min of irradiation, but escherichia coli and neisseria gonorrhoeae required 40 min for complete depiliation. partially purified proteus pili underwent progressive loss of structural integrity with increasing doses of irradiation as determined by negative staining and nephelometry, suggesting that ultraviolet light exerted  an effect directly on the pili themselves. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis demonstrated that new, small molecular weight fragments appeared after irradiation of purified e. coli pili, suggesting that cleavage of  the peptide chain rather than disassociation of pilin monomers accounted for the  loss of pili structure. ultraviolet irradiation also inhibited the ability of piliated bacteria to bind to human buccal epithelial cells. these observations indicate that the ultrastructural integrity and function of pili can be disrupted by ultraviolet light.

TI  == minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the minimal antibiotic concentration (mac) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight  times the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) to 1/128 of the mic. colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the mic was determined, and the mic:mac ratio,  which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. the mic:mac ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. there is no relation between the mics and the mic:mac ratios. the highest ratios were given by proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (mic:mac mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis (mic:mac means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).

AB  == r plasmid r772 was isolated from a strain of proteus mirabilis and is a self-transmissible p-1 incompatibility group plasmid having a molecular weight of about 27 x 10(6). it renders bacterial hosts resistant to kanamycin. phage pr772  was isolated as a phage dependent on the presence of r772 in bacterial hosts. it  is hexagonal-shaped with a diameter of 53 nm, has a thick inner membrane and no tail. vaguely defined appendages are sometimes apparent at some vertices and the  phage possesses double-stranded dna. the dna has a guanine plus cytosine molar content of 48%. the phage is sensitive to chloroform and has a buoyant density of 1.26 g cm(-3). these observations suggested that the inner membrane of the phage  could contain lipid. phage pr772 differs in morphology from the double-stranded dna plasmid-specific phages pr4 and prr1 which adsorb to tips and sides, respectively, of sex pili coded for by p-1 incompatibility group plasmids. phage  pr772 formed clear plaques which varied in diameter. serologically, phages pr772  and pr4 are possibly related though very distantly, but the two phages have identical host ranges. phage pr772 adsorbed by one of its apices to tips of sex pili coded for by plasmid r772 in escherichia coli. it also formed plaques on salmonella typhimurium proteus morganii and providence strains harbouring this plasmid as well as strains of e. coli carrying plasmids of incompatibility groups n or w. the phage produced areas of partial clearing on lawns of p. mirabilis pm5006 harbouring plasmid r772, the p-1 incompatibility group plasmid rp4, the w  group plasmid rsa or the n group plasmid n3, and on lawns of providence strain p29 carrying plasmid rp4.

TI  == the recovery period following exposure of bacteria to penicillins.
AB  == experiments with staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes have shown that when cells are exposed to bactericidal concentration of benzylpenicillin or ampicillin and the antibiotic then inactivated with beta-lactamase the count of the surviving viable cells (colony-forming units) remains essentially constant for a period of approximately 1.5--3 h before increasing at a normal rate. no such recovery period was observed, however, when escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis was exposed to a bactericidal concentration of ampicillin and the antibiotic then inactivated. microscopic observation of individual surviving cells of s. aureus following exposure to benzylpenicillin showed that in some cases resumption of cell division was delayed as long as 4 h. however, other cells in the same population showed no recovery period and resumed division within 30 min of inactivation of the antibiotic. in the latter case, the recovery period which is observed in terms of viable count may represent the period of time required for individual surviving cells to divide and give rise to normal aggregates before these fragment to produce new colony-forming units.

AB  == penicillin-binding proteins in three species of proteus, proteus mirabilis, p. morganii, and p. rettgeri, were investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis. penicillin-binding proteins in these proteus species were compared with those in escherichia coli k-12. an approximate correlation between penicillin-binding proteins in e. coli and those  in proteus species was shown by several criteria: electrophoretic mobilities; affinities of several beta-lactam antibiotics which show characteristic patterns  of binding to penicillin-binding proteins in e. coli; relation between affinities of antibiotics to the proteins and effects on morphological changes in proteus species; location of beta-lactamase activity among penicillin-binding proteins; and thermostability. the electrophoretic mobilities and several other characteristics of penicillin-binding proteins among the proteus species examined were found to be similar from species to species and differed only slightly from  those of e. coli.

TI  == comparative activities of ampicillin, epicillin and amoxycillin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of three aminopenicillins ampicillin, epicillin and  amoxycillin were compared in vitro and in vivo. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the three penicillins were very similar and the compounds were active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of escherichia coli, salmonella and shigella species, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. streptococci including streptococcus faecalis, and non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were also sensitive to the compounds but pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter and indole-positive proteus species were resistant. at concentrations close to mic value epicillin and ampicillin showed similar bactericidal activity against e. coli and against s. typhi and both compounds caused a slower rate of kill than was seen with amoxycillin. microscopical observation of the cells exposed to ampicillin and epicillin for 1 h showed the presence of filamentous forms which lysed slowly, whereas cells exposed to amoxycillin for the same period rapidly. epicillin was similar to or slightly less active than ampicillin against experimental mouse infections, and against the majority of infections both compounds were significantly less effective than amoxycillin by the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration.

TI  == investigation of the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with crohn's disease.
AB  == the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with crohn's disease with an intestinal fistula was investigated with various serological techniques. two aerobic bacterial species, e. dispar and p. mirabilis, and four strict anaerobic bacterial species, b. fragilis ss. fragilis, f. varium and two different strains of c. perfringens, were isolated from fistula secretion of the patient. these strains were used as antigens for tube agglutination, passive hemagglutination, indirect immunofluorescence and immune hemolysis assays with serum specimens obtained before and after operation of the  patient. immune responses were demonstrated to the aerobic as well as to the anaerobic bacterial strains isolated from the patient's fistula. in connection with the operation an active immune response was demonstrated to the aerobic and  anaerobic bacterial isolates. antibodies belonging to igg and iga took part in the active immune response while igm was very little involved. antibodies responsible for passive hemagglutination reactions were resistant to treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol. antibodies to aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative rods were shown to have complement fixing activity. the importance of the demonstrated antibodies for the host's defence against normal intestinal microorganisms and the inflammatory reaction as a consequence of chronic antigenic stimulation in the diseased part of the intestine in patients with crohn's disease is discussed.

AB  == the analysis of differences in occurrence of antibiotic-resistant strains belonging to ten species of "problem" bacteria was performed by means of a computer program in more than 150,000 bacterial strains isolated in slovakia in 1977. in all respects, strains isolated in general medical practice were considerably more sensitive to classical as well as to newer antibiotics. marked  differences in resistance within individual medical services could be a reflection of both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the use of a given antibiotic. urological and surgical wards, and in some respects pediatric and infectious diseases services, rendered the highest percentage of strains resistant to various drugs. there are still several antibiotics which are effective in vitro against staphylococci, while gentamicin, collistin and cotrimoxazole are the only antibiotics displaying more general activity against gram-negative "problem" bacteria. nevertheless, strains from general practice show a good response in vitro, even to older antibiotics, despite the fact that these have been widely used for decades in general practice.

AB  == the mrna for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the ecori and one of the hindiii restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total dna from nine bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae: e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes,  edwardsiella tarda, serratia marcescens, and erwinia amylovora. however, among the enterobacteriaceae, dna from two species of proteus (p. mirabilis and p. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized  with the e. coli lipoprotein mrna. furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in  four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp. ho1-n, caulobacter crescentus, and myxococcus xanthus. envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified e. coli free-form lipoprotein in the ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. both species of proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. all of the above four bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-e. coli lipoprotein serum. from these results, the rate of  evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that  observed for various soluble enzymes of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == [the distribution of minimal inhibitory concentrations of recently introduced cephalosporins in multiresistant strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spec. as revealed by zone sizes of a standardized agar diffusion test (author's transl)].
AB  == strains of a species were divided into two groups according to the number of resistances (less than or equal to 4, greater than or equal to 5) using 10 standard chemotherapeutics regularly examined, the new cephalosporins not being among them. these groups of less than or equal to 4- and greater than or equal to 5-fold resistant strains were compared for each cephalosporin tested (fig. 1). the most different distributions of zone diameters (of both groups) were seen in  cephalothin, whereas in cefoxitin and - with little limitations - also in cefuroxime in the main these distributions did not differ; they covered the same  field. the distributions of cefaclor and cefamandole took an intermediate position. with respect to the two groups similar observations were made for e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spec. the differences between the two groups were most marked in klebsiella strains. e. coli exhibited the smallest differences (fig 1). on the assumption that the distribution of zone diameters reflect that of mic's it can be concluded that nearly all of the cefaclor- and cefamandole-sensitive multiresistant strains have more elevated mic's than those  with only less than or equal to 4 resistances. on the other hand it must not be expected that mic's of cefoxitin and cefuroxim are rising in multiresistant strains. it could be demonstrated that the different qualities of the recently introduced cephalosporins revealed in multiresistant strains can be explained by  different dependences on mechanisms of cephalothin-resistance (fig. 2). this resistance is much more frequent in greater than or equal to 5-fold resistant strains. recommendations for clinical use derived from these results are discussed.

TI  == [comparison of four recently introduced cephalosporins with respect to probability of resistance in multiresistant strains of escherichia coli, proteus  mirabilis and klebsiella spec. (author's transl)].
AB  == strains with the same number of resistances were arranged in so-called resistance classes. nine classes of resistance (0 to greater to or equal to 8) were formed by means of ten standard chemotherapeutics; the four new cephalosporins were excluded. for every resistance class frequency of cephalosporinresistance was described as coefficient ranging from 0 to 1 (fig. 1). in cephalothin the coefficients were markedly rising only in 6 (7)-fold resistant strains of the species examined. similar but somewhat reduced rising of coefficients was also observed in cefaclor and cefamandole. in cefaclor this is particularly evident for e. coli, whereas in cefamandole, it concerns klebsiella spec. in the other species rising of coefficients of cefaclor and cefamandole are less marked. the probability of restance in multiresistant strains are therefore distinguished more clearly from that of cephalothin. cefuroxime and cefoxitin take a special position because the probability of resistance does not rise in multiresistant strains. the coefficients of cefoxitin do not show any recognizable dependance on multiresistance. for clinical purpose the following conclusions can be derived: because of their effectiveness in multiresistant strains cefoxitin and cefuroxime are suitable for empiric use in intensive care units where many multiresistant klebsiella-strains are to be expected. cefamandole on the other hand is characterized by a rising probability of resistance in multiresistant strains. therefore it should only be given after antibiotic testing. cefaclor, a new oral  cephalosporin, will be introduced specially for outpatients where multiresistant  strains are rarely found.

AB  == the activity of azlocillin and mezlocillin, new semisynthetic ureido penicillins, was investigated and compared with that of other known beta-lactam antibiotics. at a concentration of 25 mug/ml, azlocillin inhibited 74% of enterobacter, 97% of proteus mirabilis, 64% of citrobacter, 91% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 82% of  bacteroides strains tested. mezlocillin inhibited 86% of shigella, 96% of enterobacter, 80% of indole-positive proteus, 88% of bacteroides, and 63% of pseudomonas strains tested. azlocillin was more active against pseudomonas than was ticarcillin, carbenicillin, or mezlocillin. mezlocillin was more active than  carbenicillin and ampicillin against escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter,  citrobacter, acinetobacter, serratia, and bacteroides. azlocillin and mezlocillin were less active than cefazolin against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli and klebsiella strains but more active than cefazolin against enterobacter, indole-positive proteus, acinetobacter, citrobacter, and serratia strains. both compounds showed activity equivalent to that of cefoxitin against bacteroides isolates. both agents were destroyed by many of the beta-lactamases from gram-negative organisms.

TI  == coding of stable 4s rna molecules by the resistance factor r1.
AB  == with the aid of dna-rna hybridization experiments it was shown that an e. coli strain harbouring the resistance factor r1 contains small, stable rna species which are capable of annealing with the dna of this r-factor. at a higher hybridization temperature rna molecules form the isogenic, sensitive strain could also hybridize to the r1-dna. these rna-species were again detected if the rna was extracted from p. mirabilis carrying this plasmid. the fact that sulfur-labelled rna also hybridized to the plasmid dna seems to indicate that some of these molecules are trnas.

AB  == twenty-six patients, 20 to 77 years of age, were treated with netilmicin, mean dose 2 mg/kg every 8 h intramuscularly or in a 20-min intravenous infusion. the mean serum half-lives in patients with creatinine clearances of >/=90 ml/min and  60 to 90 ml/min were 3.2 and 3.4 h, respectively. in patients with serum creatinines of </=1.4 mg/100 ml and creatinine clearances of >/=60 ml/min, mean serum levels were 9.0 and 1.2 mug/ml, respectively, 5 to 15 min and 7.5 h post-intravenous infusion, and 7.1 and 1.7 mug/ml, respectively, 1 and 8 h post-intramuscular injection. twenty-five patients had acute pyelonephritis; 7 of the 25 had bacteremia. the infecting bacteria were escherichia coli (15), proteus mirabilis (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), enterobacter hafniae (1), and both proteus rettgeri and proteus morganii (1). all were inhibited by 6.3 mug of netilmicin per ml, except for the p. rettgeri, which required 25 mug/ml for inhibition. of 23 patients who could be evaluated, 19 were bacteriologically and clinically cured at follow-up. of the remaining four, one relapsed, two became reinfected, and one was lost to follow-up. five patients developed nephrotoxicity; two of the five had previous renal insufficiency. three patients, one with abnormal renal function, developed ototoxicity detected only with audiograms. these studies suggest that netilmicin is effective in serious gram-negative bacillary infections, but is nephrotoxic and ototoxic in humans.

AB  == synergistic activity between both azlocillin and mezlocillin and aminoglycosides  or cefazolin could be demonstrated by checkerboard dilution, isobologram, and killing curve techniques. azlocillin and mezlocillin combined with gentamicin, netilmicin, or amikacin were synergistic against escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, enterobacter, serratia, and indole-positive proteus. synergy was observed with isolates that were susceptible or resistant to azlocillin or mezlocillin. synergy was seen most often when azlocillin or mezlocillin were combined with amikacin, gentamicin, or netilmicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the combination of mezlocillin and an aminoglycoside produced synergy more often  than did carbenicillin plus an aminoglycoside. no antagonism was seen when aminoglycoside antibiotics were combined with azlocillin or mezlocillin. cefazolin was synergistic against pseudomonas, providencia, p. mirabilis, indole-positive proteus, citrobacter, klebsiella, and escherichia coli, when combined with azlocillin or mezlocillin. however, the combination of either agent with cefazolin was antagonistic when tested against selected indole-positive proteus and enterobacter isolates.

TI  == management and microbiology of cutaneous abscesses.
AB  == cutaneous abscesses in the perineal region contain primarily anaerobes commonly found in stool. non-perineal abscesses contain mixed microflora indigenous to the skin. bacteroides fragilis, the only anaerobe resistant to penicillin, is found predominantly in the perineal area. staphylococcus aureus, although the most common aerobe found, is seen less frequently than expected and is almost always resistant to penicillin. escherichia coli and neisseria gonorrhoeae are rarely found. incision and drainage is the primary mode of treatment. fever is rare, though tachycardia is common in patients with normal host defenses. patients with altered host defenses may require initial culture and gram-stained smear to determine appropriate antibiotic therapy. the gram-stained smear reliably indicates sterile and mixed abscesses, as well as those containing pure s aureus. incision and drainage alone is the only therapy required in the usual patient. since in these patients antibiotics are not required, initial culture and gram-stained smear are unnecessary.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefamandole in vitro.
AB  == cefamandole, a new cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against a cross-section of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated clinically. gram-positive cocci, except for streptococcus faecalis, were extremely susceptible to cefamandole; penicillin g-resistant staphylococcus aureus also was highly susceptible. minimal bactericidal concentrations for gram-positive cocci approximated the minimal inhibitory concentrations. strains of haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to the drug. most strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and proteus species were inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole, salmonella typhi, including ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant strains, was inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole. susceptible bacteria became increasingly resistant as the inoculum size was increased. strains of pseudomonas were resistant to cefamandole.

AB  == apalcillin (pc-904) is active against carbenicillin- and ampicillin-resistant strains of gram-negative bacilli. among pseudomonas aeruginosa strains highly resistant to carbenicillin (>/=3,200 mug/ml), half of them were susceptible to pc-904 at a concentration of 50 to 1,600 mug/ml. the minimal inhibitory concentration of pc-904 against p. aeruginosa strains resistant to carbenicillin  (400 to 1,600 mug/ml) ranged from 3.1 to 25 mug/ml. ampicillin- and carbenicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains were similarly susceptible to  pc-904. however, drug resistance to pc-904 was already apparent among some strains of p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and p. morganii, recently isolated in japan; i.e., 4, 35, 32, 4, 6, and 14% of strains isolated were resistant. pc-904 was more active, on  the other hand, than ampicillin and carbenicillin against antibiotic-susceptible  enterobacteriaceae and also showed high activity against most species of pseudomonadaceae, especially p. cepacia and p. aeruginosa. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of pc-904 were greatly affected by inoculum size when the organisms tested were strains producing large amounts of beta-lactamase.

AB  == measuring ethanol formed from arabinose by escherichia coli and dimethyl disulphide formed from methionine by proteus mirabilis is a rapid way of detecting these organisms in the urine. ethanol and dimethyl disulphide are detected by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. since sedimented organisms and  not whole urine are used the method is not subject to interference from compounds within the urine. when it was tested on 122 samples of urine, 94 from patients with suspected urinary infection and 28 supposedly uninfected control specimens,  the results correlated well with viable counts by a conventional bacteriological  method. as well as being rapid (results available in four hours) the method is reliable, easy to use, and could be automated. it now requires extensive testing  in a hospital laboratory.

AB  == the in vitro activity of a new semi-synthetic penicillin, cp-35,587, 3-(5-tetrazolyl) penam, was investigated against 496 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and 113 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci. all of the gram-positive cocci were sensitive to cp-35,587 except penicillin g resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus. this antibiotic inhibited a majority of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and proteus mirabilis at a concentration of 6.25 microgram/ml. also, approximately half of the isolates of serratia marcescens and enterobacter spp. were inhibited at a concentration of 12.5 microgram/ml. cp-35,587 was inactive when high concentrations of organisms were used as inocula. cp-35,587 was more active than mezlocillin, azlocillin, amoxicillin, ticarcillin and carbenicillin against isolates of k. pneumoniae, but other penicillins were more acte than cp-35,587 against other species of gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == the authors examined the bacteriological analysis carried our during a period of  five years (june 1971-june 1976), and pointed out the percentage of positivity and sensibility to antibiotics of the bacteria isolated. on a total of 8,263 analysis, 4,327 coprocultures and 2,076 urinocultures have been made, thus occupying the first places in frequency. 195 patogenous enterobacteria have been  isolated from coprocultures, corresponding to a positivity of 4.50%. as for the urinocultures positivity reached 43.25%; the germs most frequently isolated were  escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. the authors isolated in the same period 17 strains of myc. tuberculosis from 115 samples of expectoration (14.7%) and 27  strains from 216 samples of urine (12.5%). by recommending antibiograms, the authors suggest that the most effective antibiotics against enterobacteria responsable of infections of the urinary and gastrointestinal tract are nalidixic acid and furadantin, cloramfenicolo was ineffective against the isolated salmonella strains. as for gram-positive germs some results have been obtained with cefalotine, rifampicin, and cefazolin.

AB  == resistance markers to individual antibiotics are transmitted in e. coli with the  same frequency in the shape of a uniform linkage group, and in proteus mirabilis--with a different one. possibly in proteus mirabilis plasmide r6 dissociated, this being expressed in a different incidence of transconjugates, characterized by a different set of antibiotic resistance genes. tetracyclin resistance gene can be transmitted in p. mirabilis without being bound with other resistance determinants and with the functioning tra-operon. the expression of individual antibiotic resistance genes of plasmide r6 in p. mirabilis differed, i.e. tetracycline resistance was inducible, and to kanamycin and chloramphenicol--constitutional. the level of expression of the gene controlling  the tetracycline resistance was in noninduced condition in p. mirabilis, lower than in e. coli, p. mirabilis containing no r-factor possessed an inducible resistance mechanism to tetracycline, as in case of p. mirabilis strains containing r-factors.

TI  == terminus region of the chromosome in escherichia coli inhibits replication forks.
AB  == induction of prophage p2sig5 at 42 degrees caused replication of the bacterial chromosome in a dnaa mutant of escherichia coli. the p2sig5 is integrated in this strain near the metg locus, which is at min 47 on the genetic map. the regions of the chromosome replicated after prophage induction have been determined by means  of dna-dna hybridization with various dnas obtained from proteus mirabilis/e. coli f' merogenotes and from lambda specialized transducing phage. the replication was initiated at the prophage site and was bidirectional. most of the replication occurred in a counterclockwise direction on the genetic map, and the  replication quickly proceeded to the arod locus (min 37). the replication forks were retarded between arod and rac (min 31) loci, although the rac locus was finally replicated. a more severe inhibition of replication occurred between the  rac and trp (min 27) loci. it is proposed that the replication terminus is near the rac locus and that the terminus inhibits replication forks.

TI  == assessment of technique for rapid detection of escherichia coli and proteus species in urine by head-space gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == a test depending on the production of ethanol by escherichia coli from lactose and dimethyl disulfide by proteus spp. from methionine in the early exponential phase of growth and the detection of these products by head-space gas-liquid chromatography has been applied to 75 specimens of urine selected to provide the  most stringent trial of the test. the test was found to be rapid and reliable for the commonest findings in the microbiological examination of urine. in 3 to 4 h it detected "significant" numbers (greater than 10(5)/ml) of e. coli or of proteus mirabilis or p. inconstans a, identified as proteus spp., in 23 urines. it recorded the absence of infection from 32 urines containing borderline or "not significant" numbers of any organism. significant numbers of other organisms in 13 urines were not mistaken for e. coli or proteus spp. however, the test was less successful for some less common findings. klebsiella ozenae in significant numbers in one urine was mistaken for e. coli. p. morganii in significant numbers in one urine was not detected. e. coli or p. mirabilis mixed with significant numbers of another organism were not detected in four out of five urines. the technique is simple and could be automated. it appears to merit more extensive trial in a hospital laboratory and further development to detect and correctly identify more species that cause urinary tract infections.

AB  == proteus mirabilis was distinguishable from escherichia coli and from several other species that may be associated with urinary tract infections when grown in  a nutrient medium supplemented with 0.1 m l-methionine by the formation of large  amounts of dimethyl disulfide and methyl mercaptan, which were detected by head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). e. coli could be detected by the same hs-glc technique by ethanol production from methionine peptone water enriched with 1% either lactose or arabinose but not by any product from 10 amino acids tested. ethanol from lactose was detected early in the exponential phase of growth. significant numbers, 10(5) or more per ml, of e. coli in urine could be detected in about 5 h by ethanol production from an unshaken culture of urine in  lactose methionine peptone water buffered at ph 7.2 (urine test medium); only a trace of dimethyl disulfide was produced. significant numbers of p. mirabilis in  urine could be detected in 4 h by dimethyl disulfide production and in 5 h by methyl mercaptan production from a shaken culture of urine in urine test medium;  no ethanol was produced. incubation of urine specimens in the test medium followed by examination by hs-glc is proposed as a rapid method of detecting whether or not the urine contains significant numbers of e. coli or a species of  proteus.

AB  == as a means to development of guidelines for therapeutic application to human disease, preparations of human polyvalent gamma-globulin immune to pseudomonas aeruginosa (pg) were studied in acute infections in mice. pg was highly effective in controlling lethal infections induced in mice by the major immunotypes of p. aeruginosa; greater than or equal to 10 microgram of of gamma-globulin per mouse  protected against challenge with less than or equal to 10(6) 50% lethal doses of  p. aeruginosa. pg was less than or equal to 57 times more effective than normal human gamma-globulin. the active antibody component is specific for each immunotype; it is of the igg type and undoubltedly is directed against the o-antigen. pg was was not protective against challenge with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, or klebsiella pneumoniae; a low degree of cross-protection was seen against serratia marcescens. in a model infection involving mice in a terminal stage of advanced p. aeruginosa infection, human plasma immune to p. aeruginosa proved ineffective, but the gamma-globulin component showed moderate activity. the apparent irreversibility of this late-stage infection is not clearly ascribable to a toxin. it is postulated that  the successful treatment of advanced p. aeruginosa infections in humans would require multiple therapeutic approaches, including passive immunization with a high-potency, specifically immune globulin.

TI  == comparison of the effects of mecillinam and 6-aminopenicillanic acid on proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == single strains of proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus  were grown on filter membranes placed on agar containing concentration series of  mecillinam (fl 1060), 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-apa), or ampicillin. p. mirabilis and e. coli were also exposed to combinations of mecillinam or 6-apa with ampicillin. colony-forming units were counted, and cells were examined by interference phase-contrast and transmission electron microscopy. mecillinam and  6-apa were very effective in reducing the viability of the two gram-negative species, but they were less effective against s. aureus. combinations of mecillinam and 6-apa with ampicillin acted synergistically against the gram-negative bacilli. when the antibiotics were presented consecutively, their effects on viability were usually no greater than the effects of the individual antibiotics acting alone. when p. mirabilis and e. coli were exposed to mecillinam alone or in combination with ampicillin, the cells became rounded. 6-apa alone or in combination with ampicillin produced elongated polymorphic cells in these species. the most unusual morphological effects were ultrastructural. mecillinam and, to a lesser extent, 6-apa produced inward growth of numerous pairs of trilamellar membranous structures within the cells. it is possible that these membranes represent the growth initiation of aberrant cross walls. both mecillinam and 6-apa produced multiple, thick cross walls in s. aureus.

TI  == drug resistance in relation to use of silver sulphadiazine cream in a burns unit.

TI  == laboratory evaluation of fr10024 a new cephalosporin derivative.
AB  == fr10024 is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. the in vitro antibacterial activity of fr10024 against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis is greater than that of any of the cephalosporins developed to date. indole-positive proteus, enterobacter, and citrobacter are resistant to fr10024, as is true for the other cephalosporins. however, more than half of the strains of enterobacter and citrobacter tested were susceptible to fr10024 at an inoculum of 10(6) cells/ml. a single subcutaneous injection of fr10024 to mice with peritoneal infections due to s. aureus and several species of gram-negative bacilli gave a protective effect inferior to that of cefazolin but appeared to be superior to that of cephalothin. when given in two divided doses, however, the protective effect of fr10024 was enhanced and almost equaled that of cefazolin. the serum levels and rates of urinary recovery of fr10024 varied in different animal species. the mean peak serum level of fr10024 in humans after a single intramuscular injection of 500 mg was two times higher than that of cephalothin. the serum half-life after intramuscular injections of 250 and 500 mg was slightly shorter than that of cephalothin. after receiving 250 mg of fr10024 intramuscularly the urinary recovery rate was 87.7% in healthy volunteers. the biliary excretion rate of fr10024 was particularly high. the 24-h excretion of fr10024 in rats was 63.3%, this being six to seven times higher than that for cefazolin, which has the highest biliary excretion of the other known cephalosporins. when fr10024 was injected intramuscularly (20 mg/kg), it was found that the hepatic levels of fr10024 in rats were the highest of all the cephalosporins, including cefazolin,  but the levels of fr10024 in other tissues were not as high as those of cefazolin.

AB  == the change of lysozyme activity in the hemolymph of the wax moth larvae caused by vaccination is influenced by the size and the dose of the injected particles. the rate of incorporation of those particles into phagocytes has no effect on this process. the change of lysozyme activity correlats negatively with the amount of  granulocytes after vaccination. there were no correlations with the amount of other types of the hemocytes, neither with the resistance of the larvae against pseudomonas aeruginosa nor with the survival of gram-negative bacteria within the hemocoelom. origin, regulation and role of lysozyme are discussed regarding the defence against gram-negative bacteria. in the hemolymph of wax moth larvae after vaccination the formation of spheroblasts has been observed with all gram-negative strains of bacteria studied. the speed and extent of the formation  of spheroblasts corresponded to the pathogenicity of these bacteria for the larvae as well as to the survival of the bacteria within the hemocoelom.

AB  == homogenotes, heterogenotes, and intergeneric hybrids have been studied that are diploid for the structural gene of a major outer cell envelope membrane protein (protein ii) from escherichia coli. this protein can act as a phage receptor. in  wild-type homogenotes, diploidy for the gene did not cause a gene dosage effect.  it could be shown with two heterogenotes that both the chromosomal mutant and the episomal wild-type genes are expressed, and in each case more of the mutant than  the wild-type protein species was found in the cell envelope. in on case of 21 phage-resistant mutants missing protein ii was a trans effect observed of the mutant gene on the expression of the episomal wild type gene. transfer of e. coli episomes carrying the protein ii structural gene into salmonella typhimurium and  proteus mirabilis resulted in intergeneric hybrids that became sensitive to the relevant phage and harbored the e. coli protein ii in their cell envelopes. the results may be taken as suggestive evidence for a simple feedback mechanism for the regulation of synthesis of protein ii, and they show that there are no highly specific requirements on protein primary structure for incorporation into an outer cell envelope membrane.

TI  == effect of cephalothin on growth patterns of micro-organisms.
AB  == isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli. klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were incubated in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of  cephalothin. after destruction of the antibiotic, there was a lag phase before s. aureus began to proliferate again. when similar experiments were conducted with e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis, no lag phase was observed. this data suggests that the inhibitory activity of cephalosporins may be different for gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == biological values of the infant, juvenile, and adult agouti (dasyprocta sp) with  emphasis on microbial flora.
AB  == normal values for intestinal flora were determined on four adult, two juvenile, and four infant agoutis (dasyprocta sp) maintained at our institution. serologic, hematologic, biochemical, and histologic observations were also made on these same agoutis, and serologic, microbiologic, and endoparasitic tests were made on  serum and fecal samples from agoutis maintained at other institutions. streptococci, lactobacilli and nonenteropathogenic escherichia coli were isolated from cecal contents of all age groups. gaffkya tetragena and bacillus sp were recovered from infant agoutis, proteus mirabilis from juvenile agoutis, and proteus mirabilis and micrococcus sp from adult agoutis. infant agoutis showed marginal antibody titers to reovirus type 3 and toolan's h-1 viruses, and theiler's gdvii antibodies were detected in juvenile agoutis, but no antibody titers to murine viruses were found in the adult agoutis maintained at our institution. hematologic, biochemical, and histologic data for these agoutis were comparable to those of other hystricomorph rodents. serologic tests of the agoutis maintained at other institutions disclosed antibodies for gdvii virus in  all of 17 animals tested, while marginal titers were found for sendai virus in four and for reovirus type 3 in eight of the 17 animals. only low incidences of pathogenic bacteria (salmonella, pseudomonas, and citrobacter) were isolated from the agoutis maintained elsewhere. the endoparasites found in these agoutis were ascaris, toxascaris, strongyloides, trichuris, and trichomonas.

TI  == [approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  == in this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. this system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (ph-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (uripret-g). a total of 130 cultures was investigated. the employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. they included the following species: candida albicans, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus inconstans, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris, serratia liquefaciens, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium. employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.

TI  == properties of plasmids constructed by the in vitro insertion of dna from rhizobium leguminosarum or proteus mirabilis into rp4.
AB  == plasmids have been constructed by insertion of dna from rhizobium leguminosarum or proteus mirabilis into rp4 (an r factor of group p). such recombinant plasmids retain the wide host range of the parental plasmid, being as efficiently transmissible as the unmodified rp4 and are stably maintained in rapidly growing  cultures. the recombinant plasmids, even though each contained a dna sequence absolutely identical with that of the host strain, are no more efficient at mobilizing the transfer of chromosomal genetic information from that host strain  than was unmodified rp4. we therefore conclude that an unknown factor must be essential in the process of chromosome mobilization and rate limiting for that process.

AB  == transcription of escherichia coli ribosomal dna introduced into proteus mirabilis on f14 is described. we have developed an assay for e. coli coded ribosomal rna involving fingerprinting of ribonuclease t1 digests of rna isolated from ribosomal subunits. sequence differences in the ribosomal rna of the two species  have allowed us to detect e. coli coded 16s, 23s, and 5s ribosomal rna in ribosomal subunits of the e. coli-p. mirabilis hybrid. the proportion of e. coli  coded rrna in the hybrid is found at a level which is compatible with the number  of e. coli (and p. mirabilis) ribosomal dna sequences. the resulting ribosomal rna appears in ribosomes in a form which indicates extensive compatibility of e.  coli coded ribosomal rna with p. mirabilis ribosomal proteins and maturational factors.

TI  == tobramycin and cephalothin for treatment of suspected sepsis in neutropenic children with cancer.
AB  == the safety and efficacy of tobramycin and cephalothin in treatment of suspected sepsis were studied in neutropenic children with various malignancies. twenty episodes of suspected sepsis in 19 febrile children with cancer were treated with parenteral tobramycin and cephalothin; the duration of therapy ranged from one to 80 days. in 14 of the 20 episodes of suspected sepsis, a favorable clinical response was achieved within five days after initiation of antibiotic therapy. these episodes included a urinary tract infection with proteus mirabilis and sepsis due to escherichia coli. in four of the additional six episodes, clinical  deterioration was though to be caused by the underlying malignancies. two episodes included a case of e. coli spesis that ended fatally and a nosocomial infection with eikenella corrodens. results of this study suggest that combination therapy with tobramycin and cephalothin is safe and efficacious in treatment of suspected sepsis in febrile children with malignancies and neutropenia.

TI  == susceptibility of "enterobacteria" to penicillins, cephalosporins, lincomycins, erythromycin, and rifampin.
AB  == agar dilution tests for susceptibility of gram-negative rods and enterococci were done with a number of penicillins, cephalosporins, lincomycin analogues, erythromycin, and rifampin. many in the first three categories were investigational drugs. all were generally less active than aminoglycoside and tetracycline antibiotics against gram-negative rods and more active against enterococci. cephalosporins as a group were more active than penicillins against  klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli and less active enterococci. both groups were equally active against enterobacter, proteus, and providencia but inactive against most strains of serratia and all strains of pseudomonas; however, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and bl-1654 were active against most strains of pseudomonas. penicillins and cephalosporins were more active against proteus mirabilis than against indole-positive proteus. lincomycins had little or no activity against gram-negative rods but were moderately active against enterococci. erythromycin was more active than the lincomycins, but rifampin was  much more active than either of these types of drug. of the penicillins, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and bl-p1654 were the most active against gram-negative rods, whereas bl-p1654, amoxicillin, and ampicillin were the most active against enterococci. the penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cyclacillin, and penicillin v were essentially inactive against gram-negative rods. of the cephalosporins tested, cephanone and cefamandole were the most active against most gram-negative rods, whereas cephaloridine and cephacetrile were the most active against enterococci. the least active of the cephalosporins against most species were cephradine, cephalexin, and cephapirin, but cefoxitin was the least  active against enterococci.

TI  == purification and properties of the alpha2beta2 complex of tryptophan synthetase of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == a procedure is described for the purification of the tryptophan synthetase alpha2beta2 complex from cell extracts of proteus mirabilis. a 30-fold purification was achieved with an overall yield of about 23% and a specific activity of 1,600. the complex can be dissociated and the subunits isolated in a  pure form. the complex can be reconstituted from the isolated subunits to regain  the initial activity. the alpha and beta2 subunits of the tryptophan synthetase complex of p. mirabilis are not significantly different from those of escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria as to their physical properties, amino acid compositions, and enzymic properties. complementation studies indicate that the alpha subunit of p. mirabilis hybridizes well with the beta2 subunit from e. coli. similarly, the beta2 subunit of p. mirabilis readily complexes with the alpha subunits from e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and serratia marcescens. the hybrids formed are all effective in catalyzing the conversion of indoleglycerol phosphate plus serine into tryptophan and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. however, these hybrids have reduced or no activity in the other reactions, namely, the condensation of indole and serine to form tryptophan or the aldolytic cleavage of indoleglycerol phosphate.

AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in  combination were determined by a broth microdilution method for 100 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic isolates representative of pathogens recovered from patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. gentamicin inhibited all strains of klebsiella, enterobacter, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in concentrations of 0.4 to  3.1 mug/ml and all strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis in concentrations of 0.8 to 12.5 mug/ml. whereas minocycline did not consistently inhibit these organisms in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with gentamicin against 43% of the enterobacteriaceae tested in clinically achievable concentrations; significant synergy was most common with e. coli (60%). minocycline inhibited 62% of bacteroides fragilis, 71% of clostridium, 40% of anaerobic cocci, and 40% of enterococci tested in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml. whereas gentamicin rarely inhibited these organisms in concentrations of 6.2 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with minocycline against 20% of b. fragilis, 67% of clostridium, 22% of anaerobic cocci, and 22% of enterococci (which had minimal inhibitory concentrations of minocycline within the range tested) at clinically achievable concentrations. although only four (13%) of the 30 isolates resistant to both gentamicin and minocycline alone were inhibited by clinically achievable concentrations of the combination, the observed synergy, particularly against strains of e. coli, was considered to be of potential clinical usefulness. antagonism between gentamicin  and minocycline was not observed at the concentrations tested.

TI  == ecori restriction endonuclease map of the composite r plasmid nr1.
AB  == a physical map of the composite r plasmid nr1 has been constructed using specific cleavage of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) by the restriction endonuclease ecor-. digestion of composite nr1 dna by ecori yields thirteen fragments. the six largest fragments (designated a to f) are from the resistance transfer factor component that harbors the tetracycline resistance genes (rtf-tc). the seven smallest fragments (designated g to m) are from the r-determinants component that harbors the chloramphenicol (cm), streptomycin-spectinomycin (sm/sp), and sulfonamide (sa) resistance genes. the largest fragment of several rtf-tc segregants of nr1 that have deleted the r-determinants component is 0.8 x 10(6) daltons larger than fragment a of composite nr1. only a part of fragment h of the r-determinants component is amplified in transitioned nr1 dna in proteus mirabilis, which consists of multiple, tandem sequences of r-determinants attached to a single copy of the rtf-tc component. both of these changes can be explained by the locations of the excision sites at the rtf-tc: r-determinants junctions that are involved in the dissociation and reassociation of the rtf-tc and r-determinants components. the thirteen fragments of composite nr1 dna produced by ecori have been ordered using partial digestion techniques. the order of the fragments is: a-d-c-e-f-b-h-i-l-k-g-m-j. the approximate locations of the  tc, cm, sm/sp, and sa resistance genes on the ecori map were determined by analyzing several deletion mutants of nr1.

AB  == with frequent use of aminoglycoside antimicrobials and beta-lactam antibiotics in hospitals in the last few years, the number of bacterial strains resistant to these chemotherapeutics increased. lately, strains of e. coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, proteus and pseudomonas resistant to many antimicrobials  (ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, tobramycin, sisomycin, neomycin, paromomycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, sulphonamides) were isolated from patients of the university hospital in zuerich. the resistant phenotype of two representative strains (klebsiella pneumoniae 1 and serratia marcescens 2) could be transferred by mixed cultivation to e. coli k-12. multiple resistance of strain 1, and addition, could be transferred to salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens, providencia, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae in varying frequencies. transfer to pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, could not be achieved. spontaneous instability of resistance was observed in 0.15% of the cells of an overnight brothe culture and in 90% of the cells of a three months old culture. conjugation, instability and the response to the sex phages ms-2 and if-1 suggested that resistance was mediated by a monomolecular r-factor, belonging to the fi+-type. this suggestion  was confirmed by molecular characterization of the resistance plasmids. after transfer of the r-factors of k. pneumoniae 1 (r-fk 1) and serratia marcescens 2 (r-fk2) into e. coli k-12, plasmid dna was labelled with (methyl-3h) thymidine, and isolated by isopycnic centrifugation in cesiumchlorid-ethidium-bromide. analysis of plasmid dna then was carried out by sedimentation in a 5-20% neutral  sucrose gradient together with reference plasmids of known molecular weights and  sedimentation constants. the analysis revealed that r-fk1 had a molecular weight  of 54 x 10(6) and r-fk2 of 50 x 10(6) daltons. the values were confirmed by contour length measurements of open circular forms with an electron microscope. a comparison of the sedimentation profile of labelled plasmid dna from strain 1 and 14c-labelled dna of e. coli k-12 (r-fk1) showed that the wild-type strain contained, besides the large resistance plasmid, at least two smaller "cryptic" plasmids. these smaller plasmid molecules were also found in antibiotic susceptible variants of strain 1, which did not contain the 54 x 10(6) dalton plasmid molecule, responsible for the resistant phenotype. the number of copies of r-fk1 in e. coli k-12 was determined to be 2, indicating stringent control of  replication. it is discussed that the growing number of isolations of strains of  escherichia, klebsiella, serratia, proteus, providencia and pseudomonas, exhibiting the same resistance phenotype, results from the spread of the r-factor described above among the hospital bacterial flora.

TI  == antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  == it has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. this was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. in similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.

TI  == studies of introital colonization in women with recurrent urinary infections. v.  the inhibitory activity of normal vaginal fluid on proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == normal vaginal fluid from premenopausal volunteers was inoculated with 10 strains of proteus mirabilis and 14 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at ph's of 4.3, 4.6 and 4.9. all bacteria were killed at ph 4.3. nine of 10 strains of proteus mirabilis and 12 of 14 pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed at ph 4.6. only 4 of 14 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed at ph 4.9, while 8 of 10 strains of proteus mirabilis were killed at the same ph. we conclude that in comparison to the common 0 group strains of escherichia coli, vaginal fluid is more bactericidal to proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa and that these observations may help explain the relative infrequency of bacteriuria owing to the organisms.

TI  == efficacy of cinoxacin in urinary tract infections.
AB  == cinoxacin, a new synthetic antibacterial agent with in vitro activity against all species of enterobacteriaceae, was used in the treatment of urinary tract infections in 20 patients. the dose of cinoxacin was 250 mg orally every 6 h for  10 days. the etiological agents were escherichia coli in fifteen, klebsiella-enterobacter in five, proteus mirabilis in two, and providencia in one. the minimal inhibitory concentration for these organisms ranged from 2 to 64 mug/ml. eleven of the 20 patients had renal involvement by defined criteria, whereas the remaining nine were considered to have bladder bacilluria. the initial strain was eradicated during and immediately after treatment in 19 of 20  cases. at 6 weeks, 65% had sterile urine. bactericidal urine levels of cinoxacin  were obtained in all patients. no significant hematological, renal, hepatic, or gastroenterologic toxicity was noted. cinoxacin appears to be a safe and useful drug in the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == epidemiologic aspects of nosocomial infections.
AB  == in a currently ongoing surveillance of hospital-associated infections in two metropolitan hospitals in oklahoma, the results over a four-month period suggest  at least tentative principles of host-agent relationships in hospital-associated  infections. within the urinary tract, the site with the highest number of total isolations, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common pathogens. by age, the under 5 and over 60 year age groups had the highest number of isolations. staphylococcus aureus and e coli were isolated more frequently in  the younger group, while k pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and proteus mirabilis occurred more frequently in infections among the older group. a higher frequency  of enterobacter sp and s aureus were isolated among male patients, while candida  albicans and e coli apparently had a greater affinity for females; however, none  of these differences by sex were statistically significant. over 50% of the infections were manifest within the first ten days of hospitalization.

AB  == gentamicin (gm) was studied for on its antibacterial activity, absorption, and excretion, effect on the kidney and clinical effects. the results obtained are as follows: 1. antibacterial activity: the susceptibility of e. coli, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis to gm was almost the same between the periods of 1964 to 1966 and 1972 to 1974: no tendency of increase of resistance by year was noted. however, against pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains showing sensitivity to a concentration of more than 25 mcg/ml were isolated in 12.7%, in the latter period (1972-1974), as compared with the former period (1964-1966), which was 0%. 2. blood levels: the peak level of gm in blood was obtained at 30 minutes after intramuscular injection to a healthy human. the peak level was 7.6 mcg/ml with 40 mg dose, 8.7 mcg/ml with 60 mg and 10.6 mcg/ml with 80 mg, showing a dose-responding curve. the half-life of gm absorption was 1.1 hours with 40 mg dose, 1.3 hours with 60 mg and 1.6 hours with 80 mg, showing also a dose related  tendency. 3. urinary levels: the peak level of gm in urine, about 200 mcg/ml, was noted in 0-2 hours after intramuscular injection of gm to a healthy human. the urinary recovery was about 44% in 6 hours. 4. effect on the kidney: the effects of gm on the kidney was studied in rats administering 20 mg/kg once a day for 21  days consecutively. the results obtained are a slight increase (20 mg/dl) in bun  and a slight decrease (2,600 mosm/kg h2o) in urinary osmotic pressure; and urea lysozyme showed tendency to increase from the third day, the same as with kanamycin. meanwhile, in the histopathological findings of the kidney tissue, the vacuolar degeneration and flattening of renal tubules were noted. similar findings were obtained with kanamycin in a similar type of experiment. these results indicate that nephrotoxicity of gm is considered to be approximately the  same as that of kanamycin. 5. clinical results: gm was injected into 22 patients  with various infectious diseases (respiratory tract infections 7, liver abscess 1, urinary tract infections 14). excellent efficacy was noted in 7 patients, good in 13 and no effect in 2. the effective rate was 90.9%. no serious side effect was noted in this clinical trial.

TI  == polymicrobic bacteriuria: significant association with bacteremia.
AB  == current clinical practice states that a urine culture yielding three or more isolates must be considered a contaminated specimen and discarded. the validity of this practice was tested by reviewing all patients at the west haven veterans  administration hospital with positive blood cultures for 1 year to determine how  many were associated with polymicrobic bacteriuria (two or more urine isolates each present at greater than 10(5) colonies/ml). during 1973 there were 18 patients who had bacteremia associated with a urinary tract infection in which the same organism with the identical antibiogram was found in both the blood and  the urine of these 18 patients with monomicrobic bacteremia 11(61%) had polymicrobic bacteriuria, with a mean of an additional 1.75 urinary pathogens present in significant quantities. in these patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria, an indwelling bladder catheter was present for a mean period of 4.4  months before the episode of bacteremia. only 5 of the 11 patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria had temporally associated urinary tract manipulation. monomicrobic bacteriuria occurred in seven patients (39%). the mean indwelling bladder catheter time was 0.9 days, and urinary tract manipulation near the time  of bacteremia occurred in all seven patients. prospectively, nine other patients  with polymicrobic bacteriuria were recultured by one of us to be certain that appropriate collection and transportation methods were used; the presence of polymicrobic bacteriuria was repeatedly demonstrated in 7(78%). this study illustrates the clinical importance of polymicrobic bacteriuria.

TI  == derivation and properties of f-prime factors in escherichia coli carrying nitrogen fixation genes from klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == a his+ nif+ escherichia coli k12, hfr strain (unf43) was constructed by an intergeneric mating between a klebsiella pneumoniae donor strain (hf3) and a his-hfr e. coli strain (sbi824) which transfers his as an early marker. an f-prime nif plasmid, fn39, carrying genes which correspond to the e. coli chromosomal region, metg gnd his shia, but excluding purf and arod, was isolated  from unf43. translocation of carbenicillin resistance genes from a p-type r-factor, r68, to fn39 increased the stability of his and nif on the derivative f-prime, fn68. sedimentation analysis of both f-primes in sucrose gradients revealed our covalently closed circular(ccc) dna species of molecular weights 279 +/- 9, 136 +/- 3, 90 +/- 1 and 44 +/- 1 megadaltons. it is suggested that the two smallest ccc-dna species are component replicons of the composite f-primes of molecular weight 136 +/- 3 megadaltons, and that the molecules of 279 +/- 9 megadaltons are ccc-dimers. fn68 was transferable in intergeneric matings to klebsiella aerogenes, k. pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium but not to proteus mirabilis; only carbenicillin resistance and sex factor activity were transferred to erwinia herbicola. nif genes on fn68 were expressed in a nif- mutant of k. pneumoniae and also in s. typhimurium, which in conventional tests is naturally non-nitrogen-fixing; expression of the his determinant of fn68 became temperature-sensitive in s. typhimurium.

AB  == cefamandole nafate, a new cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro against 231 recent clinical isolates and in 12 patients. cefamandole had activity equivalent to cefazolin against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. cefamandole was more active than cephalothin or cefazolin against proteus mirabilis. both cefamandole and cefazolin were as active as cephalothin against s. aureus, were slightly more active against k. pneumoniae, and were considerably more active against e. coli. all strains of indole-positive proteus sp. were inhibited by 6.3 mug of cefamandole per ml but only 20% were inhibited by 25 mug of cefazolin or cephalothin per ml. eighty-eight percent of enterobacter sp. was inhibited by 25 mug of cefamandole per ml, but only 20 and 5% were inhibited by the same concentration of cefazolin  and cephalothin, respectively. peak levels of cefamandole ranged from 6.0 to 110  mug/ml in serum and levels ranged from 440 to 16,800 mug/ml in a 4- to 6-h collection of urine after a 500-mg or 1-g intramuscular dose (6.1 to 17.3 mg/kg)  in patients with endogenous creatinine clearances of >/=31 ml/min. these levels were done after the first dose, at mid-therapy, and at the end of therapy. there  was no evidence of accumulation with the 500-mg or 1-g dose given every 4 to 6 h. the percentage of the dose excreted in the urine within the first 4 to 6 h after  administration of cefamandole was >/=43%. the half-life of cefamandole in serum was 49 to 126 min.

TI  == [in vitro examination on antibacterial activities of broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative clinical isolates (author's transl)].
AB  == in vitro studies were undertaken on clinically isolated strains of various bacteria to examine the antibacterial activity of ampicillin (ab-pc), carbenicillin (cb-pc), sulbenicillin (sb-pc) cephalothin (cet), cefazolin (cez) and gentamicin (gm). fifty three % of escherichia coli strains 53.3% of citrobacter sp., 80% of proteus mirabilis, 42.9% of morganella and 80% of bacteroides sp. were susceptible (mic being not higher than 12.5 mug/ml) to ab-pc. the eight other species were not so susceptible to this penicillin. cb-pc  and sb-pc were almost as effective as ab-pc against escherichia coli and citrobacter sp. they were less active against klebsiella sp., but more active against enterobacter sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus group and pseudomonas sp. than ab-pc, sb-pc was more effective than cb-pc against pseudomonas sp. the strains of pseudomonas sp. which were resistant to higher concentrations of cb-pc and sb-pc were pyocyanine-negative strains. all strains (100%) of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp. and citrobacter sp. were susceptible to cet and cez, while none of enterobacter sp. , serratia sp., proteus vulgaris.  morganella, rettgerella, providencia and pseudomonas sp. were susceptible to these cephalosporins. the mics of cet and cez against bacteroides sp. were moderately low. some strains of providencia and alkaligenes sp. were resistant of gm but the other 10 species were not resistant to this antibiotic, though it showed comparatively high mics against bacteroides sp. when seen from the mic distribution of each antibiotic, there was a tendency that the strains isolated from the pus were more resistant than those isolated from the other sources (urine, sputum and bile).

AB  == measurements of uv sensitivity of wildtype cells (wt) and uv senistive mutants of e. coli and p. mirabilis suggest that the increased sensitivity of p. mirabilis (wt) is due either to incomplete repair of dna lesions or to additive lethality probably as a result of uv induction of defective phage(s) present in p. mitabilis (taubeneck, 1967). direct estimates of the rate of pyrimidine dimer excision and a comparison of the uv reactivation capacity of e. coli and p. mirabilis for the temperate phages lambda and pi 1, respectively, support this conclusion.

TI  == abnormal forms of bacteria produced by antibiotics.
AB  == subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can produce in vitro aberrant forms of bacteria that are similar to those observed in specimens and cultures from patients being treated with antibacterial agents. eight species of bacteria were  grown on membranes placed on agar containing subinhibitory concentrations of nine antibiotics. the resulting organisms were examined by gram stain and electron microscopy. gram stains showed filamentous and granular forms of enterobacteria with bipolar staining, giant staphylococci, and rodlike pneumococci. electron micrographs showed changes in the number and distribution of ribosomes in enterobacteria and septum abnormalities in cocci. such abnormal forms can occasionally simulate the appearance of quite different species, and they may indicate the presence of a subinhibitory antibiotic concentration at the site of  infection as a result of prior antibacterial therapy.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and clinical pharmacology of ticarcillin and carbenicillin.
AB  == the in vitro activity and human pharmacology of ticarcillin, a semisynthetic penicillin more active than carbenicillin against pseudomonas, were compared. there has been no increase in resistance to ticarcillin of pseudomonas strains over the past 5 years, but resistance of indole-positive proteus and serratia strains has been documented. after intramuscular (i.m.) injection of 1 g of ticarcillin, mean peak levels occurred at 1 h (26.9 mug/ml) with a decline over 6 h (6.8 mug/ml). serum half-life was 84 min. dilution of ticarcillin lidocaine reduced pain on i.m. injection but did not alter serum levels. blood levels after 1 g i.m. are adequate to treat infections produced by escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and some enterobacter, but not pseudomonas. after rapid intravenous infusion of 3 and 5 g, mean peak serum levels of ticarcillin were slightly lower  for 1 h than those achieved with carbenicillin. probenecid administered before infusion produced increases in blood levels, half-lives, and volume of distribution. the biological half-life of ticarcillin was 72 min compared to 66 min with carbenicillin. there was a larger volume of distribution for ticarcillin than carbenicillin (15 liters versus 14 liters). the ticarcillin half-life when administered with probenecid was 108 min. urinary recovery of ticarcillin was 77% against 95% of carbenicillin. however, approximately 10% of ticarcillin is recovered as penicilloic acid so that 95% of an intravenously administered dose is recovered.

TI  == amino-acid composition of the covalent rigid-layer lipoprotein in cell walls of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == cell walls of proteus mirabilis in the stationary phase of growth contain a lipoprotein in covalent linkage to peptidoglycan and probably also in free form in the outer membrane. the protein moiety of this lipoprotein is composed of about 50 amino acids and has an approximate molecular weight of 5500. the proteus lipoprotein has glycine and phenylalanine as specific components which are not present in lipoproteins of other enteric bacteria. treatment of the peptidoglycan-lipoprotein complex of proteus with trypsin leaves lysine as the only lipoprotein amino acid attached to the peptidoglycan. this suggests that in  p. mirabilis, as in escherichia coli, the lipoprotein is linked to the peptidoglycan by its c-terminal lysine residue.

TI  == effect of surfactants on antibiotic resistance.
AB  == the effectiveness of surfactants as potentiators of antibiotic activity on several resistant strains of bacteria, selected from clinical sources and laboratory collections, was studied using a tube dilution assay. bacterial strains included members of the enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci. cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (ctab), tween 80 (tw80), a mixture of n-alkyldimethyl betaines (l14), and alpha-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (tcp) were tested in combination with pencillin g (peng), methicillin (met), streptomycin (sm), polymyxin b (pmb), and chlortetracycline (ctc). growth response to the drug combinations was compared with the response to each drug alone. ctab and l14 but not tw80 or tcp were found to potentiate the activity of  ctc on strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae. studies on the inhibition of protein synthesis by ctc in cells of a strain of e.  coli suggested that the surfactants increased the uptake of antibiotic into the cells. ctab and l14 almost completely sensitized strains of p. mirabilis, serratia marcescens, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli to pmb. with the exception of k.  pneumoniae, tcp was also effective in potentiating the activity of pmb on the above strains whereas tw80 showed potentiation only with a strain of e. coli. ctab and l14 but not tcp or tw80 potentiated the activity of peng but not met on  strains of staphylococci. studies of penicillinase in the cells suggested that the surfactants inhibited the formation of this enzyme possibly at the level of induction. none of the surfactants were found to potentiate the activity of sm.

TI  == nation-wide survey of antibiotic resistance by means of a computer: bacterial strains from the urine, stool, and upper respiratory tract.
AB  == all-nation data of antibiotic resistance of about 200 000 bacterial strains isolated in the slovak socialist republic in 1973 have been grouped, and compared, by means of a computer, into resistances of strains isolated from the urine, from upper respiratory tract (urt), from stool and from other pathological materials. in general, urine strains of all species investigated were found to be more resistant to "main antibiotics", and, suprisingly, to septrin, than strains  from other sources. strains of staphylococcus aureus, and, notably, of klebsiella-enterobacter from the urt are generally more susceptible to antibiotics than strains of these species isolated from other sources. urine strains of e. coli, p. mirabilis and ps. aeruginosa show a high degree of resistance almost to all antibiotics, with exception of gentamicin and colistin (for e. coli and ps. aeruginosa only). further antibiotics for combatting these strains are urgently needed. similar computer-assisted monitoring of strains from the very specified sources may be easily adapted for individual hospitals, clinics and even wards.

TI  == bacterial studies of clindamycin-associated colitis. a preliminary report.
AB  == the cause of pseudomembraneous colitis is not known but has been attributed to an alteration in the microbial flora of the colon. to test this hypothesis, a blind, prospective study was undertaken in which fecal samples were cultured quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. the patients from which these samples were taken were all receiving clindamycin and had diarrhea secondary to the use of the drug. we were able to show definite differences in the colonic microflora which correlated with the presence of pseudomembranes on biopsy. those patients who had diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis showed a striking decrease, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the number of anaerobes present. those patients who had diarrhea but no pseudomembranes had large numbers of anaerobes which qualitatively approximated normal fecal cultures but quantitatively were fewer in number. a third group of patients, which had resolving pseudomembranous colitis, and were no longer symptomatic, had large numbers of anaerobic organisms which approximated those found in normal fecal cultures. there were no differences among the three groups with regard to facultative anaerobic microflora. thus, the presence of pseudomembranous colitis  correlated directly with a striking quantitative and qualitative decrease in the  anaerobic microflora of the colon. the symptom of diarrhea alone appeared to have no meaning with regard to changes in the bacterial flora. resolution of pseudomembranous colitis was associated with a return of the anaerobic microflora.

AB  == one-year surveillance of single and multiple antibiotic resistance of 8 species of so-called "problem bacteria" by computer analysis of data obtained from 18 public health laboratories in slovakia in 1973 enables to establish the most frequently occuring spectra of multiple drug resistance which would point to the  spread of typical r plasmids among the problem bacteria investigated. as an introduction, we surveyed the mode of testing of problem bacteria in individual phls against antibiotics - drugs of choice. iw was important to find out whether  strains belonging to problem bacteria investigated are tested against sufficient  number of antibacterial drugs. our study shows that the percentage of bi- and multiple drug resistance in almost all bacterial species investigated depend on the number of antibiotics used in tests in vitro as single discs. the more antibiotic discs are used to test the strains, the more chance the laboratory has to register the true picture of multiresistance to antibiotics. our study also shows that the testing in the phls associated to the computer study in this respect is inadequate. moreover, the increasing complexity and proportion of multiple drug resistance in problem bacteria - with a notable exception of salmonellae - forces the phls to use more and more discs so that using two petri  dishes full of discs - 12 to 15 discs - begins to be necessary in testing of most of the problem bacteria under investigation.

(ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

AB  == authenic tracheobronchial secretions/exudates (tbse) were aspirated under direct  vision via a sterile catheter passed through a fiberoptic bronchoscope from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease complicated by chronic bronchitis. tbse, saliva and blood were obtained during long-term administration  of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx) and were assayed for drug content. before and during treatment tbse were cultured qualitatively and quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi, mycoplasmas and viruses. treatment with tmp-smx was associated with a decrease in the recovery of hemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis; however, little effect was observed on the typically nonpathogenic aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of the upper respiratory tract. tmp  was found in saliva at concentrations greater than in serum. both tmp and smx entered tbse in absolute and relative concentrations sufficient to take advantage of the potential for synergy against susceptible microorganisms. patient tolerance of tmp-smx was generally good and several patients reported a decrease  in production of sputum during treatment.

TI  == experience with detailed surveillance of nosocomial infection.
AB  == infection rates have been determined in a 332 bed university hospital using an efficient surveillance program. this computerized program analyzed, summarized and returned infection reports in six days. the efficiency rate of this system was 80 per cent as determined by prevalence survey. the mean nosocomial infection rate for the 12 month study period was 10.8 per cent. neurology, medicine, neurosurgery, surgery and urology ahd the highest attack rates. urinary tract infections composed 44 per cent of the total and predominated on seven of the 11  services. escherichia coli predominated in infections of the urinary tract, surgical wounds and blood and ranked third in respiratory infections. escherichia coli, klebsiella, pseudomonas and proteus mirabilis accounted for 61 per cent of  the isolates. there is a need for efficient reporting of hospital infections to establish effective preventives.

AB  == the sharing of one and possibly two or more non-type-specific antigens by most strains of groups a, c, and g streptococci is described. with the exception of a  single strain of proteus mirabilis, this antigen(s) was not found among strains of groups b and d streptococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp., and salmonella sp. the non-type-specific antigen(s) could  not be separated from m protein by fractionation with various saturations of ammonium sulfate or by column chromatography with calcium hydroxylapatite even though the latter method allowed the recovery of a fraction of m protein which was free of the cross-reactive antigen(s). the resistance of this non-type-specific antigen(s) to hot acid extraction and its sensitivity to treatment with trypsin differentiate it from the t and r antigens of group a streptococci, both of which are trypsin resistant. co-precipitation of both type-and non-type-specific antigens occurred with type-specific antiserum and suggested that the type- and non-type-specific antigens represent either different, covalently bonded antigenic determinants on the same protein or different proteins noncovalently linked together.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cinoxacin in vitro.
AB  == cinoxacin is a new synthetic compound similar chemically and in antimicrobial activity to oxolonic acid and nalidixic acid. it is most effective against escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, but at concentrations expected in the urine it is inhibitory for all species of enterobacteriaceae. relative to nalidixic acid, cinoxacin has slightly greater inhibitory and bactericidal activity, less inoculum effect probably due to less heterogeneity in the susceptibility of bacterial cells, and less inhibition by high concentrations of  serum protein. both drugs are more active in an acid than an alkaline medium. glucose can specifically antagonize the inhibitory effect against p. mirabilis. in urine the bactericidal rate and effect are decreased. resistance to cinoxacin  can be developed quickly by serial transfers in vitro. some nonresistant organisms remained viable in bactericidal drug concentrations. the in vivo importance of the favorable features of cinoxacin must be determined by clinical  trials.

TI  == electron microscope heteroduplex studies of sequence relations among bacterial plasmids: identification and mapping of the insertion sequences is1 and is2 in f  and r plasmids.
AB  == heteroduplex experiments between the plasmid r6 and one strand of the deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) of a lambda phage carrying the insertion sequence is1 show that is1 occurs on r6 at the two previously mapped junctions of resistance transfer factor (rtf) dna with r-determinant dna. from previous heteroduplex experiments, it then follows that is1 occurs at the same junctions in r6-5, r100-1, and r1 plasmids. heteroduplex experiments with the dna from a lambda phage carrying the insertion sequence is2 show that one copy of is2 occurs in r6, r6-5, and r100-1 (but not r1) at a point within the rtf with coordinates 67.5 to  68.9 kilobase units (kb). in an accompanying paper, ptashne and cohen (1975) show that the insertion sequence is3 occurs on r6 and r6-5. r100-25, a trac mutant, differs from its parent r100-1 only in that it contains an additional copy of is1 inserted within the tra gene region of 82.1 kb. r100-31, atrax, tc-s mutant of r100-1, is deleted in r100-1 sequences starting at one of the is3 termini (46.9 kb) and extending with rtf to 61.0 kb. heteroduplex studies of f plasmids with the dna of a lambda phage bearing insertion sequence is2 show that the sequence of f with coordinates 16.3-17.6f is is2. the occurrence of is1 at the two junctions of r-determinant dna and rtf dna in r plasmids provides a structural basis to explain the mechanism of the previously observed formation of molecules  containing one rtf unit and several tandem copies of the r-determinant unit, when r plasmids in proteus mirabilis are grown in the presence of antibiotics, and the segregation of an r plasmid into an rtf unit and an r-determinant unit. in general, correlation of our results with previous studies shows that insertion sequences play a role in a variety of f- and r-related intra- and intermolecular  recombination phenomena.

AB  == beta-lactamases (ec. 3.5.2.6) from strains of gram-negative bacteria have been studied using analytical isoelectric focusing. this permits a visual comparison of the patterns of beta-lactamase bands produced by enzymes from different organisms. purification of crude intracellular preparations is unnecessary and the technique is sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate beta-lactamase in mutants  previously reported to lack the enzyme. r that have not been distinguished from one another biochemically or immunologically can be differentiated by isoelectric focusing. conversely, the enzymes specified by the r factors rtem, r1 and rgn14,  with identical isoelectric focusing patterns have the same biochemical properties. chromosomal and r-factor-mediated beta-lactamases from single strains have been separated and their identities confirmed by immunoisoelectric focusing. r factor-mediated enzymes gave identical isoelectric focusing patterns irrespective of the host strain. isoelectric focusing can therefore be used to observe the transfer of beta-lactamases carried by r factors.

TI  == interactions of heteroaromatic compounds with nucleic acids. 2. influence of substituents on the base and sequence specificity of intercalating ligands.
AB  == this paper presents the results of a systematic study on the effects of substituents on the base and sequence specificity of tricyclic heteroaromatic compounds interacting with dna by intercalation. all the compounds tested are derived from proflavine and acridine orange analogs with different heteroatoms in the middle ring. their base and sequence specificities were determined by differential dialysis of the ligand against dna samples of differing g-c content. the main results indicate that (a) the introduction of a phenyl substituent into  one of the two available positions of the middle ring increases or decreases the  g-c specificity of the ligand depending on the position where the substitution takes place; (b) compounds of the substitution type of neutral red (2-methyl-3-amino-7-dimethyl-amino-phenazine) show unexpectedly high g-c specificities and (c) dna ligands of pronounced sequence specificity for adjacent g-c pairs can be constructed by combining the structural elements of neutral red  with an additional phenyl residue in the same molecule. the further study of compounds related to the phenylated neutral red revealed that the g-c specificity can be improved or destroyed by additional substituents. the comparison of the g-c specificity and the dna-affinity data of the compounds studied leads to the suggestion that the specificity arises mainly from electronic factors which are strongly controlled through steric constraints on possible ocmplex geometries. as a basis for the discussion a possible structure for the dna complex of the phenylated neutral red is considered in which the extra phenyl ring at n-5 of the phenazinium system, protrudes into the large groove of the dna helix while the tricyclic part of the ligand is inserted between the dna base-pairs.

AB  == by means of the diffusion test, the range of action of the ampicillin successive  preparation spectacillin was determined using 12 000 pathological germs freshly isolated from in-patients. the result was a range of action similar to that of ampicillin. a comparison, however, is only possible in case the test platelets (without over-dosage) are each charged with exactly, e.g., 25 gamma. the analyses of serum concentrations have shown that spectacillin is satisfactorily absorbed after oral as well as after parenteral application. thus, the calculation of the  accumulated area of infinity beneath the serum concentration curve had the following results: after single intravenous injection of 1 g spectacillin (n equals 12) 51.46 gamma/ml - h; after single intravenous injection of 2 g spectacillin 86.20 gamma/ml - h; after intramuscular injection (twice) - interval of 12 hours - 29.94 gamma/ml - h after 12 hours; same values as before, but after 24 hours, 29.37 gamma/ml - h. after a single oral application of one capsule of spectacillin (capsule equals 500 mg), the value of the accumulated area was 8.46  gamma/ml - h. in analogy of the good absorption, excretion in urine/24 hrs (after application of 1 g spectacillin intravenously) was 61.74 p.c., after 2 g i.v. 54.30 p.c., and after applying twice 1 g spectacillin intramuscularly 61.40 p.c.; after oral application of 500 mg, the percentage was 28.42. tolerance of spectacillin was good after oral as well as after parenteral application. no side effects were observed.

TI  == aminopenicillins - clinical pharmacology and use in disease states.
AB  == ampicillin introduced in 1961 has been administered in the treatment of diverse infections by both oral and parenteral means. oral infections of the upper airways such as otitis media, bronchitis, and pneumonia have responded with high  success rates since the microorganisms involved have remained sensitive to ampicillin. similarly, out-patient urinary tract infections caused by escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterococci are cured. typhoid fever may yet be treated with ampicillin, but shigellosis has become refractory with the development of resistant strains. ampicillin has assumed a prominent role in the  treatment of gonorrhoea. parenteral ampicillin is still a mainstay of the treatment of hemophilus meningitis, but the recent appearance of ampicillin resistant strains may become a serious problem. a number of derivatives and analogues of ampicillin have been developed. among the compounds, hetacillin, metampicillin and pivampicillin which hydrolyze in the body to yield ampicillin,  only pivampicillin appears to offer advantage over the parent compound. blood levels are twice those of a comparable dose of ampicillin. however, more comparisons with ampicillin in clinical situations are needed. the other analogues of ampicillin are epicillin, cyclacillin and amoxicillin. epicillin has no superiority to ampicillin, and the cyclacillin data do not show clear superiority over ampicillin in spite of initially high blood levels, since the compound is less active and so rapidly cleared from the body. amoxicillin, on the other hand, has been shown to have it vitro activity equal to ampicillin and to produce higher blood levels for a longer period of time. clinical studies have substantiated efficacy in treatment of otitis media, pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonitis, and urinary tract infections at doses half those of ampicillin. it has been effective in gonorrhoea and typhoid, but not in shigellosis. it would seem that to date only pivampicillin and amoxicillin, particularly the later, should be considered as replacements of ampicillin in oral therapy.

AB  == sisomicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic which is produced by micromonospora myoensis, was studied against 565 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and  gram-positive cocci. with the exception of serratia marcescens, over 90% of isolates of gram-negative bacilli were inhibited by 1.56 mug/ml or less of sisomicin. sisomicin was slightly more active than gentamicin and tobramycin aganist isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp. it was substantially more active than butirosin and kanamycin against all gram-negative bacilli. isolates of gram-negative bacilli which were resistant to  gentamicin and tobramycin were also resistant to sisomicin. most of these isolates were sensitive to amikacin.

AB  == several penicillins known to be stable to enterobacterial beta-lactamases were tested in combination with beta-lactamase-sensitive penicillins and cephalosporins in a turbidimetric system. nafcillin was found to be the best beta-lactamase inhibitor amongst agents presently available commercially, but the related, new semi-synthetic penicillin brl 1437 (2-isopropoxy-1-naphthylpenicillin) was consistently found to be superior. using  103 ampicillin-resistant coliform bacilli and antibiotic levels achievable in urine, cephalothin or cephaloridine alone achieved long-term suppression of growth (greater than 20 h) of 16 and 13% of strains, respectively, while the additional presence of brl 1437 suppressed growth for longer than 20 h of 81% of  the remaining strains. even where 'success' was not achieved according to these stringent criteria, regrowth was significantly delayed by the presence of brl 1437. suppression of growth for longer than 20 h by brl 1437 plus cephalothin was achieved with all of the 46 escherichia coli strains tested. antibiotic combinations were also studied in an in vitro model which stimulates the hydrokinetic features of the urinary bladder. suppression of the growth of two highly resistant e. coli strains was achieved in this system, for therapeutically acceptable periods of time, with combinations of cephalothin or cephaloridine with brl 1437, but not nafcillin.

TI  == r-factor mutant capable of specifying hypersynthesis of penicillinase.
AB  == the physical characteristics of a mutant, r(m201-2), capable of conferring high and stable ampicillion resistance was analyzed. the r(m201-2) and its parent r-factor deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) could be isolated as an extrachromosomal and covalently closed circular form. their buoyant densities were both 1.712 g/cm(3), and their molecular weights were about 82 x 10(6) and 64 x 10(6), respectively, when measured by cscl and sucrose density gradient analyses. the contour lengths  by electron microscopy were 35.9 +/- 0.6 and 31.0 +/- 0.6 mum, respectively. by using the extracted r-factor dna, the mutant and parent characters were transformable to another escherichia coli strain. the mutant r factor showed an increased amount of dna even after conjugal transfer to proteus. an increase in the size of r-factor dna was thus considered to be the cause of the high level of ampicillin resistance.

AB  == the existence of a free form of a specific lipoprotein of molecular weight 7,200  was examined in the envelopes of several gram-negative bacteria. when the envelope proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, distinct peaks were observed in salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at the same position as the free form of the lipoprotein of escherichia coli. however, the peak was not observed in proteus mirabilis. the protein at the peak in s. typhimurium was shown to contain little or no histidine as expected from the amino acid composition of the lipoprotein. furthermore, antiserum against the highly purified lipoprotein from  e. coli was shown to react with the proteins from s. typhimurium and s. marcescens and to form the specific immunoprecipitates. in contrast, the protein  from p. aeruginosa did not react with the antiserum at all. thus, it is concluded that s. typhimurium and s. marcescens have the free form of the lipoprotein in their envelopes as does e. coli. p. aeruginosa contains a protein of the same size as the lipoprotein, but it is not certain whether the protein is the same structural protein as the lipoprotein from e. coli. p. mirabilis may not have any free form of the lipoprotein, may have it in a very small amount, or may have a lipoprotein of different molecular weight serving the same function.

AB  == growth of proteus mirabilis harboring r100-1 (fi(+)drd str(r)cml(r)tet(r)sul(r))  factors in penassay broth containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) leads to the loss of all or part of the genetic elements in high frequencies. in media containing sds at concentrations as low as 0.03%, both lysis of r(+) cells and elimination of the r factors occur at high frequencies. appearance of drug-susceptible cells in r(+) cultures occurs during the exponential phase of growth; however, the frequencies of susceptible cells increase substantially after the culture reaches the stationary phase. reconstruction experiments, coupled with other observations, suggest that the major factor in altering the frequency of drug-susceptible variants is the greater resistance of the variants  to the lytic action of sds. this resistance correlates in most cases with the loss of the transfer functions in the resistance transfer factor.

TI  == r-factor-mediated beta-lactamases that hydrolyze oxacillin: evidence for two distinct groups.
AB  == the enzymatic and molecular properties of 14 oxacillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases, all of them r-factor-specified, were studied, and two distinct groups were found. four of the enzymes had a molecular weight of 24,000, were active against methicillin, and had an electrophoretic mobility of -0.1 cm/h. eight enzymes had a molecular weight of 45,000, low activity against methicillin, and an electrophoretic mobility of +0.5 cm/h. the remaining two enzymes were similar to those of the second group in being relatively inactive against methicillin, but their molecular weight was lower (42,000) and their electrophoretic mobility was different (-0.1 cm/h). all the enzymes of both groups were sensitive to inhibition by sodium chloride. the two groups were not completely homogeneous in their enzymatic properties; seven possible subtypes could be recognized.

TI  == r-mediated beta-lactamases and episomal resistance to the beta-lactam drugs in different bacterial hosts.
AB  == ten penicillinase plasmids of varying taxonomic origin were studied after transfer to a variety of bacterial hosts. nine of the ten plasmids specified enzymes with the following identical, or very similar, properties: substrate profile, molecular weight, susceptibility to heat and inhibitors, and electrophoretic mobility, i.e., tem-like enzymes. the tenth r-mediated beta-lactamase was a cephalosporinase. plasmids with tem-like enzymes mediated resistance patterns identical towards the beta-lactam drugs, whereas the resistance pattern of the cephalosporinase plasmid was distinctly different. expression of enzyme and resistance had a dual r-factor and host specificity. escherichia coli k-12 and salmonella typhi constituted one group of the same r-factor phenotype expressions. most, but not all, penicillinase plasmids exhibited in proteus pm1 a considerably lower order of beta-lactamase activity and an even lower order of resistance to the beta-lactam drugs than the previous  two hosts. this difference was most pronounced for the resistance to carbenicillin, which was mediated by the plasmids specifying the synthesis of tem-like enzymes. release by osmotic shock was complete in the host e. coli k-12  for the tem-like enzymes, but was lower for the cephalosporinase and minimal or negative in the pm1 host. crypticity factor for benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and carbenicillin was not related to the increase in resistance mediated by the penicillinase plasmids in both k-12 and pm1 hosts. inoculum size effects for the  penicillins and 6-aminopenicillanic acid were higher in pm1 than in k-12 r(+) cultures. the expression of penicillinase plasmids in wild-type bacteria was strain specific and not species specific. for two plasmids of different phenotypes for beta-lactamase activity (and resistance) in k-12 and pm1 hosts, a  positive correlation was found between their phenotype and the relative amount of episomal deoxyribonucleic acid, as detected by ethidium bromide density gradient  centrifugation. this is interpreted as indicating differences in the mode of replication of the plasmids in the two hosts.

TI  == technique for determining the bactericidal effect of drug combinations.
AB  == two paper strips, each containing different antimicrobial agents, were placed on  plates on mueller-hinton agar to permit antibiotic to enter the agar. a filter membrane was placed on this plate, and the microorganisms were planted on the membrane. after 6 h of incubation at 37 c, the membrane was transferred to antibiotic-free mueller-hinton agar containing triphenyltetrazolium hydrochloride and incubated for 18 h at 37 c. specific growth patterns were indicative of additive (indifferent), synergistic, or antagonistic effects of the drug combination used. trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole proved to act synergistically against 85% of escherichia coli, 86% of klebsiella, and 89% of proteus mirabilis  strains tested. a few strains resistant to either drug were susceptible to their  combination. the technique was useful against organisms with widely differing susceptibilities to the two antimicrobial agents tested.

TI  == round of replication mutant of a drug resistance factor.
AB  == a derivative of the r factor nr1 (called r12) has been isolated which undergoes an increased number of rounds of replication each division cycle in proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and salmonella typhimurium. the alteration resulting in the increased number of copies (round of replication mutation) is associated with the transfer factor component of the r factor. r12 has the same drug resistance pattern as nr1, is the same size as shown by sedimentation in a sucrose gradient and electron microscopy (63 x 10(6) daltons), and has the same partial denaturation map. the level of the r factor gene product chloramphenicol  acetyltransferase has been examined in p. mirabilis and was found to be consistent with gene dosage effects. the plasmid to chromosomal deoxyribonucleic  acid ratio of nr1 increases several fold after entry into stationary phase, whereas this ratio for r12 remains approximately constant. individual copies of r12 are selected at random for replication from a multicopy plasmid pool. a smaller percentage of r12 copies replicate during amino acid starvation than has  previously been found for nr1 in similar experiments.

TI  == alternate forms of the resistance factor r1 in proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the resistance factor r1 may exist in either of two stable physical states in proteus mirabilis pm-1. in one case, the r1 deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) has a buoyant density of 1.711 g/cm(3) and replicates under stringent control. cells harboring r1 in this form may transfer drug resistance by conjugation. in the other case, r1 dna shows two buoyant density classes at 1.707 and 1.714 g/cm(3).  the 1.714 g/cm(3) component is replicated under a degree of relaxed control, and  strains carrying this form generally cannot transfer drug resistance by conjugation. intracellular amounts of the r factor-coded enzyme, chloramphenicol  acetyltransferase, did not correspond to amounts of plasmid dna in proteus, and the enzyme was present in lower amounts than in escherichia coli. it is proposed  that the two states of r1 in proteus may represent stable associated and dissociated forms of the plasmid.

TI  == microbial detection method based on sensing molecular hydrogen.
AB  == a simple method for detecting bacteria, based on the time of hydrogen evolution,  was developed and tested against various members of the enterobacteriaceae group. the test system consisted of (i) two electrodes, platinum and a reference electrode, (ii) a buffer amplifier, and (iii) a strip-chart recorder. hydrogen evolution was measured by an increase in voltage in the negative (cathodic) direction and recorded on a strip-chart recorder. hydrogen response curves consisted of (i) a lag period, (ii) a period of rapid buildup in potential due to hydrogen, and (iii) a period of decline in potential. a linear relationship was established between inoculum size and the time hydrogen was detected (lag period). lag times ranged from 1 h for 10(6) cells/ml to 7 h for 10(0) cells/ml.  for each 10-fold decrease in inoculum, length of the lag period increased 60 to 70 min. mean cell concentrations at the time of hydrogen evolution were 10(6)/ml. based on the linear relationship between inoculum size and lag period, these results indicate the potential application of the hydrogen-sensing method for rapidly detecting coliforms and other gas-producing microorganisms in a variety of clinical, food, and other samples.

TI  == experience in monitoring gentamicin therapy during treatment of serious gram-negative sepsis.
AB  == this paper reports our experience in monitoring gentamicin therapy during the treatment of 68 episodes of serious gram-negative sepsis in 65 hospital patients. most of the patients had major underlying disease. of those who were adequately treated (peak serum concentrations of 5 mug/ml or more in 72 hours for septicaemia, urinary tract infection, and wound infection; and 8 mug/ml or more at some time during the course of treatment for pneumonia) 84% (46 out of 55) were cured. these serum concentrations could be achieved only by starting with a  regimen of 5 mg/kg/day in three divided doses in all adult patients, subsequent dosage being determined by the results of rapid serum assay. the incidence of nephrotoxicity and symptomatic ototoxicity was no greater than in previous series. the main reason for assaying serum gentamicin is to ensure that an adequate dosage is achieved as soon as possible. in patients with impaired renal  function or receiving prolonged high dosage assays also serve to guard against an excessive accumulation of gentamicin and an increased risk of toxicity.

TI  == double-blind comparison of cephacetrile with cephalothin-cephaloridine.
AB  == under double-blind protocol, a controlled comparison was made between a new cephalosporin, cephacetrile, and cephalothin or cephaloridine. the patient's primary physician determined the indications for treatment, and the dosage was uniform for each route of administration. infecting strains of staphylococci and  proteus mirabilis had a lower median inhibitory concentration for cephalothin than cephacetrile; the opposite was true for escherichia coli and klebsiella species. the average peak serum level 1 h after a dose of 2 g intravenously was 74.9 +/- 21 and 21.5 +/- 8.7 mug/ml for cephacetrile and cephalothin, respectively; 6 h after the dose, the respective levels were 12.4 +/- 4.3 and 3.7 +/- 0.9 mug/ml. renal clearances were similar and the plasma clearance was proportional to the serum levels. in the urine, the concentration of cephacetrile was three times higher than that of cephalothin. based on a percentage of therapeutic potential, success in the treatment of infections with susceptible organisms was 42 and 44% for the two different drug regimens. initial bacterial resistance was found in about one-fifth of infections, and concomitant therapy with other drugs was practiced in one-half of the treatment courses. intravenous  use of cephacetrile was discontinued prematurely more often than was use of cephalothin, suggesting less tolerance. although there was no overt toxicity, more than 75% of patients on either regimen had some form of unwanted response to treatment, the most common being superinfection. from this limited but controlled experience, cephacetrile can be considered comparable to cephalothin in antimicrobial treatment and overall side reactions.

TI  == relation of r factor and chromosomal beta-lactamase with the periplasmic space.
AB  == the release of several r factor and chromosomal beta-lactamases by osmotic shock  treatment was studied. it was found that those beta-lactamases with a molecular weight of about 20,000 were released, but those with a molecular weight of about  30,000 to 44,000 were not released during osmotic shock. this differential release did not depend on whether the structural genes were on the chromosome or  on the genome of an r factor. the release or retention of the beta-lactamases appeared to be a characteristic of the enzyme rather than the host cell since the same results were obtained when the r factors were harbored by a variety of host  bacteria. studies with bacteria which produced more than one beta-lactamase showed that each enzyme reacted independently to the presence of other beta-lactamases produced by the host bacterium.

TI  == fractionation of dna on hydroxyapatite with a base-specific complexing agent.
AB  == we describe a chromatographic technique for separating mixtures of dna of varying g + c content. the method employs a specially prepared high-capacity hydroxyapatite and a g.c-specific dna ligand (2-methyl-3-amino-7-dimethylamino-5-phenyl-phenazinium cation, abbreviated pnr).  dna molecules rich in g.c pairs bind larger amounts of this dye and are eluted earlier from the hydroxyapatite column than are molecules rich in a.t pairs. the  dye can easily be removed from dna by dialysis or solvent extraction after the chromatographic separation. the resolution of the method approaches that of cscl  density gradient separation, and the capacity of the column is much larger than that of a typical density gradient experiment. elution of the dna is not dependent on molecular weight, so samples of different molecular weight can be separated on the basis of g + c content. the technique should be especially useful for separating g.c-rich minor components from dna obtained form eukaryotic cells, as demonstrated by a fraction of dna from calf thymus.

TI  == effects of inhibition and restoration of protein synthesis on the replication of  the r factor rts1 in proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the effect of inhibition of protein synthesis on the replication of the r factor  rts1 in proteus mirabilis was examined by using the technique of cscl density gradient centrifugation. only 12% of the copies of rts1 were found to replicate during amino acid starvation, whereas there was a 30% increase in the amount of p. mirabilis chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) during the same period. essentially the same amount of rts1 and host chromosome replication was observed  when chloramphenicol was used to inhibit protein synthesis. the replication of rts1 dna was also examined in experiments in which cultures were starved for amino acids in (14)n-labeled medium and then transferred to (15)n-labeled medium  containing the required amino acids. these experiments showed that rts1 replication took place throughout the first generation in (15)n-labeled medium and that each copy of rts1 was replicated one time during the first generation of chromosomal dna synthesis in (15)n-medium.

TI  == cefoxitin, a semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic: susceptibility studies.
AB  == cefoxitin, 3-carbamoyloxymethyl-7-alpha-methoxy-7-[2-(2-thienyl)acetamido]-3-cephem-4- carboxylic acid, is a new semisynthetic cephamycin with broad antibacterial activity. it is highly active against gram-negative microorganisms including indole-positive proteus and serratia strains, which are ordinarily reistant to the cephalosporins. cefoxitin is also highly active against many strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis which are resistant to the cephalosporins. furthermore, e. coli and klebsiella strains which are susceptible to the cephalosporins are generally more susceptible to the cephamycin analog. the susceptibility of the gram-positive bacteria falls well within the effective range of the antibiotic for gram-negative organisms, but cefoxitin is less active than cephalothin or cephaloridine. as is the case with the cephalosporins, strains of pseudomonas and group d streptococci are resistant to cefoxitin. changes in ph, inoculum density, and growth medium have no significant effect on  the activity of the antibiotic.

TI  == studies on beta-galactoside transport in a proteus mirabilis merodiploid carrying an escherichia coli lactose operon.
AB  == merodiploid derivatives bearing an f-linked lac operon (i(+), o(+), z(+), y(+), a(+)) from escherichia coli were prepared from a proteus mirabilis strain unable  to utilize lactose and from a lac deletion strain of e. coli. a suitable growth medium was found in which the episomal element in the p. mirabilis derivative was sufficiently stable to allow induction of the episome-borne lac operon and thus to permit a comparison of the activities and properties of e. coli lac products in the intracellular environments of p. mirabilis and e. coli. in both derivatives the episomal lac operon was shown to be repressed in the absence of inducer. kinetics of induction with gratuitous inducer (isopropyl-1-thio-beta-d-galactoside) were similar for both beta-galactosidase activity (beta-d-galactoside galactohydrolase, ec 3.4.1.23) and beta-galactoside  transport activity in both derivatives, although the ratio of galactoside transport to beta-galactosidase activity was approximately 1.6-fold higher in the e. coli derivative. comparison of beta-galactosidase and m-protein (lac y gene product)-specific activities indicated coordinate expression of the induced lac operon in both derivatives. quantitatively, the maximal beta-galactosidase specific activity was two or three times higher for the e. coli derivative. a significant sodium azide inhibition (65% inhibition by 10 mm sodium azide) of lactose permease-mediated transport of o-nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside from an outside region of high concentration to an inside region of very low concentration ("downhill transport") was observed for the p. mirabilis derivative. identical conditions for the e. coli derivative yielded only about 15% inhibition. active transport of thiomethyl-beta-galactoside was similar for both derivatives, the major difference being that active transport was more sensitive to azide poisoning in the p. mirabilis derivative. preliminary examination of the thiomethyl-beta-galactoside derivatives following active transport did not demonstrate the accumulation of a phosphorylated product in either strain but did reveal an unidentified derivative present in the p. mirabilis merodiploid extract which was not detectable in the e. coli merodiploid.

TI  == comparative activity of amoxycillin and ampicillin in an experimental bacterial infection in mice.
AB  == against experimental infections in mice with strains of escherichia coli and with proteus mirabilis, amoxycillin was found to be more active than ampicillin both by the oral and the subcutaneous routes of administration. with the bacteria used in these experiments, ampicillin and amoxycillin showed the same minimal inhibitory concentrations and, after subcutaneous administration, the levels of ampicillin and amoxycillin in the plasma and tissue homogenate were also similar. however, counts of the number of viable bacteria present in the infected tissue showed that amoxycillin exerted a more rapid and a more marked bactericidal effect than did ampicillin, and this could be correlated with the difference in therapeutic effect. when given by mouth, amoxycillin was more completely absorbed than ampicillin and gave rise to higher levels of antibiotic in the plasma. this  may have accounted in part for the difference in therapeutic activity seen when these penicillins were given by the oral route. however, when appropriate oral dosages of ampicillin and amoxycillin were used so as to achieve similar levels of antibiotic in the plasma and tissue homogenate, amoxycillin was again found to exert a more marked bactericidal effect than did ampicillin, and this was accompanied by greater therapeutic activity. in experiments in vitro, amoxycillin also showed a more rapid bactericidal effect than did ampicillin against the bacteria which were used to produce the experimental infections.

AB  == the susceptibility of clinical isolates of escherichia coli (67) and proteus species (58) to cephalothin, ampicillin, benzyl penicillin, and phenoxymethyl penicillin was determined in vitro by using broth dilution and disk diffusion tests. the data were correlated by using a four-category scheme for interpreting  minimal inhibitory concentrations (groups 1 to 4) as recommended by a subcommittee of an international collaborative study of susceptibility testing. with cephalothin and ampicillin, groups 1 (susceptible) and 2 (moderately susceptible) were susceptible by the disk test, and with benzyl penicillin, similar results were observed when the interpretive zone standards were changed.  strains categorized as group 4 (very resistant) were resistant by the disk method, but group 3 (moderately resistant) strains were not adequately distinguished by disk testing. group 3 susceptibility to benzyl and phenoxymethyl penicillins can be predicted by extrapolating results from tests with ampicillin  disks.

TI  == clinical and laboratory evaluation of amoxicillin (brl 2333) in the treatment of  urinary tract infections.
AB  == amoxicillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzyl penicillin) is a new oral semisynthetic  penicillin with antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin; however, it is more completely absorbed and urinary concentrations are higher. twenty-seven patients during 28 episodes of urinary tract infection were treated with oral amoxicillin given either as 250- or 500-mg doses. clinical cure or improvement occurred in 23 of 27 infections (85%); eradication of the responsible organisms occurred in 23 of 26 infections (88%); and both clinical cure or improvement and  eradication occurred in 20 of 25 infections (80%). three infections relapsed. failure to respond bacteriologically was associated with resistant organisms in two patients and with chronic pyelonephritis (proteus mirabilis) is one. concentrations of amoxicillin in serum obtained 2 h after administration were more variable than those previously reported for reasons which were obscure. in vitro studies revealed amoxicillin to be comparable to ampicillin when tested against most gram-negative bacilli; however, in this situation amoxicillin may be more effective than ampicillin against enterococci.

TI  == host cell growth in the presence of the thermosensitive drug resistance factor, rts1.
AB  == we have confirmed and extended the observation of terawaki et al. that the r factor, rts1, alters the growth of its host at 42 c. in all media tested there was a period during which total cell numbers increased linearly, while viable counts remained constant. during this period the rate of precursor incorporation  per cell particle into deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and protein declined steadily. these patterns were a consequence of the accumulation of increasing numbers of cells which had lost colony-forming ability. a temperature  shiftdown experiment showed that the colony formers could, after a lag, go on to  divide normally, whereas most of the noncolony formers could not undergo even a limited number of divisions after shiftdown. the number of normal divisions which occurred after shiftup of rts1 cells to 42 c was medium dependent. in rich medium there were, on the average, two or three doublings; in glucose medium, one; and in glycerol medium, only a fraction of a doubling. even in glucose medium, however, no increase in viable counts was observed during growth at 42 c if the cells were first starved for glucose for 1 h at 42 c. a temperature shiftdown from 42 c to 27 c during glucose starvation reversed the effect of starvation at  42 c alone. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the thermosensitive rts1 component(s) responsible for the host effects is present at  permissive temperature, but can undergo a reversible temperature-induced alteration which then interferes with some essential host function. the detrimental effects of this r factor on its host were also reflected in a heightened sensitivity to kanamycin and actinomycin d at 42 c. electron microscope observations revealed changes in the appearance of the cell membrane.  membranous invaginations were noted at discrete sites in the cell.

TI  == r-factor-mediated resistance to tetracycline in proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the expression of r-factor-mediated resistance to tetracycline has been compared  in proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. resistance to a range of concentrations of tetracycline was significantly lower in p. mirabilis than in e. coli in both induced and repressed states. indirect evidence showed that conditions which result in a marked increase in the level of resistance of p. mirabilis harboring the r factor nr1 to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and spectinomycin due to an amplification in the number of copies of r-determinants per cell do not detectably increase the level of resistance to tetracycline. tetracycline resistance was inducible in early stationary-phase p. mirabilis nr1  although not after 5 h in this state. double isotope labeling of control and tetracycline-induced p. mirabilis nr1 in early stationary phase revealed isotopic enrichment of certain peaks in extracts from induced cells subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

AB  == heat-stable antibacterial activity in the following suspensions was demonstrated  against pseudomonas aeruginosa at ph 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5: (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48-h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii)  anaerobic, 48-h cultures of different bacteria from human colon flora (escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis). the lower the ph of the medium, the greater was the antibacterial activity of these suspensions. the antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against p. aeruginosa than against three enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p.  mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0.16 m to 0.005 m) and at the 3 ph values studied (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). as the ph value increased, the antibacterial  activity decreased. antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each ph value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pk(a) values. lactic acid, with the lowest pk(a), exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. acetic and butyric acids, two of the three predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa in vitro at the ph of the mouse cecum. these results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the  colon flora may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by p. aeruginosa.

AB  == igg with antibacterial antibody opsonic activity was isolated from rabbit antisera produced by intravenous hyperimmunization with several test strains of pneumococci, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, proteus  mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. antibody-enzyme conjugates were prepared, using diethylmalonimidate to couple glucose oxidase to  igg antibacterial antibody preparations. opsonic human igg obtained from serum of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis was also conjugated to glucose oxidase. antibody-enzyme conjugates retained combining specificity for test bacteria as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. in vitro test for bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates utilized potassium iodide, lactoperoxidase, and glucose as cofactors. under these conditions glucose oxidase conjugated to antibody generates hydrogen peroxide, and lactoperoxidase enzyme catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with simultaneous oxidation of i(-)  and halogenation and killing of test bacteria. potent in vitro bactericidal activity of this system was repeatedly demonstrated for antibody-enzyme conjugates against pneumococci, streptococci, s. aureus, p. mirabilis, and e. coli. however, no bactericidal effect was demonstrable with antibody-enzyme conjugates and two test strains of p. aeruginosa. bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates appeared to parallel original opsonic potency of unconjugated igg preparations. antibody-enzyme conjugates at concentrations as low as 0.01 mg/ml were capable of intense bactericidal activity producing substantial drops in surviving bacterial counts within 30-60 min after initiation of assay. these in vitro bactericidal systems indicate that the concept of antibacterial antibody-enzyme conjugates may possibly be adaptable as a mechanism for treatment of patients with leukocyte dysfunction or fulminant bacteremia.

AB  == modified moore's swabs, placed in sewers for 5 days, were used to concentrate salmonellas from sewage. duplicate cultures of swab strips in selenite broth were incubated at 41 and 37 degrees c. respectively. salmonella organisms were recovered consistently from the swabs when the enrichment broths were incubated at 41 degrees c. however, when equal portions of the same swabs were incubated at 37 degrees c., only 22% of them yielded salmonella organisms. these results indicate an advantage in incubating the selenite broths at 41 degrees c. rather than 37 degrees c. in attempting to isolate salmonellas from sewage.one hundred and fifty faecal samples were examined for salmonellas by culture in selenite broths incubated at 41 and 37 degrees c. twelve (8%) samples were positive at 41  degrees c. compared to only 10 (6.7%) positive samples at 37 degrees c. this difference is not statistically significant to indicate an advantage of the elevated-temperature of incubation over the conventional temperature in attempting to isolate salmonellas from human faeces. moreover, results of the recovery rates of s. paratyphi b, s. typhi, and s. typhimurium indicate that an incubation temperature of 37 degrees c. is more appropriate for recovering salmonellas from artificially infected faecal samples than an incubation temperature of 41 degrees c. this stresses the inability of laboratory studies to mimic conditions in nature.

AB  == amoxicillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzyl penicillin, brl 2333) is a new semisynthetic penicillin which is structurally similar to ampicillin, but which is better absorbed and yields higher concentrations in serum and urine. the in vitro susceptibility of 145 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 30 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined against various concentrations of amoxicillin and ampicillin in agar. in addition, inhibitory zones around discs containing 10 mug of amoxicillin were measured and compared with results of agar  dilution studies. the drug also was evaluated in the treatment of 38 patients with bacteriuria, who received doses of either 750 mg or 1 g/day for 10 days. in  vitro, amoxicillin was comparable in activity to ampicillin; most isolates of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were inhibited by 10 mug or less/ml, whereas the majority of strains of enterobacter, klebsiella, indole-positive proteus species, and pseudomonas grew in concentrations greater than 50 mug/ml. clinically, amoxicillin was effective in eradicating bacteriuria due to susceptible organisms and was very well tolerated. for practical purposes, however, amoxicillin performed no better than a host of other drugs presently available for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated bacteriuria.

AB  == a penetration barrier operating outside the periplasmic enzyme penicillinase was  studied in an ampicillin-resistant mutant of escherichia coli k-12. growth in the presence of lysozyme and sublethal concentrations of ampicillin partially opened  the barrier. this could be recorded as an increased penetration of penicillin g,  sodium cholate, and rifampin to their respective targets. brief treatments with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and sodium cholate effectively impaired the barrier against penicillin and also caused leakage of penicillinase. wild-type e. coli k-12, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa also showed an increased sensitivity to cholate after treatment with penicillins. electron micrographs showed that lysis by cholate was due to a distortion of the cytoplasmic membrane causing a leakage of protein and  rna from the cells to the medium. physiological data indicated that the increased sensitivity to cholate induced by growth in the presence of ampicillin or lysozyme was due to effects upon the murein. this was supported by measurement of the incorporation of (3)h-diaminopimelic acid. these results indicate that the murein sacculus either is a part of the penetration barrier or is responsible for holding the structure of the outer membrane together.

AB  == cephamycins a, b, and c are naturally produced cephalosporin-type antibiotics. although a and b were found to be more active than c against gram-positive organisms, they were not so active against such strains as are cephalosporin c or the semisynthetic antibiotics cephaloridine and cephalothin. against gram-negative organisms, cephamycin c was more active than a or b and, in general, was as active as the cephalosporins. in addition, cephamycin c was active in vitro against clinically isolated strains resistant to the cephalosporins, such as proteus, providencia, and escherichia coli. the in vitro  antibacterial activity of cephamycin c, cephalothin, and cephaloridine is primarily bactericidal. a 10,000-fold increase in inoculum of a strain of proteus mirabilis resulted in 200-fold or greater increases in minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal end points of cephalothin and cephaloridine, but only 10- and 16-fold increases, respectively, for cephamycin c. after 15 passages through  antibiotic-containing broths, during which time a culture of e. coli showed an increase in minimal inhibitory concentrations of streptomycin of >1,000-fold, end points for cephamycin c increased 4-fold, for cephalothin, 1.5-to 6-fold, and for cephaloridine, 128-fold.

AB  == the effects of thymine limitation on the rates of growth, deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) synthesis, and increase in viable cell number for a thymine auxotroph of proteus mirabilis were investigated. at thymine concentrations of 1.0 mug/ml and  below, these rates were markedly decreased. after a reduction in thymine concentration from 10 mug/ml to 0.2 mug/ml, mass synthesis continued at the preshift rate for several hours. in contrast, the rate of dna synthesis immediately decreased, resulting in a decrease in the dna to mass ratio to about  one-half of its normal level. viable counts remained constant for several hours after the reduction in thymine concentration, and enlarged cells and multicellular "snakes" were formed. the rate of dna synthesis was reduced at thymine concentrations below approximately 1.7 mug/ml. the addition of thymine to cultures which had been completely starved for thymine increased the rate of dna  synthesis to at least twice its normal value; this suggests that extra rounds of  chromosome replication can be induced in p. mirabilis as previously observed in escherichia coli.

TI  == amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

AB  == one hundred fifty-two strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella-enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 mug of tobramycin/ml in a broth-dilution method and showed zones of inhibition of 16 mm or more around a 10-mug tobramycin disc in the kirby-bauer method. tobramycin was most active against s. aureus, 100% of strains being inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. all strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and indole-positive proteus species, and 80% of enterobacter species were inhibited by 0.8 mug of tobramycin/ml, whereas only 48% of p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by this concentration. tobramycin was approximately twice as active as gentamicin against s. aureus, four times as active against p. aeruginosa, slightly more active against e. coli and enterobacter species, equally active against p. mirabilis, and slightly less active against k. pneumoniae. the minimal bactericidal concentrations of tobramycin and gentamicin  were the same as or twice the minimal inhibitory concentrations for all strains except those of p. aeruginosa, against which greater concentrations of both gentamicin and tobramycin were required for bactericidal activity. tobramycin sterilized cultures of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa, but the rate of bactericidal action was faster with a combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin than with either antibiotic alone in the same concentrations. tobramycin retained potency in the presence of 200 to 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml for at least 6 hr of incubation at 37 c, but lost potency in the presence of 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml by 24 hr of incubation and in the presence of 800 mug/ml by 2 hr of incubation.

AB  == a mutant of the repressed r factor r1a and two mutants of the derepressed r factor r1drd-19 showing a two- to fourfold increase in resistance to all of the antibiotics to which the wild-type r factors mediate resistance were studied. the increased resistance was due to a two- to fourfold increase in the number of r-factor copies per chromosome. the production of drug-metabolizing enzymes was linearly correlated to the gene dosage. there was also a linear correlation between resistance to the drugs and the production of the corresponding enzymes.  the mutations were also expressed in proteus mirabilis pm1. in proteus, r factors are split into two plasmids, resistance transfer factor and the resistance part.  the mutation in one of the mutant r factors seems to be located in the resistance part. a second fi(+) r factor (r100) was introduced into strains already carrying r1drd-19 or the mutant r factor r1drd-19b2. in the first case, r100 and r1drd-19  segregated with equal probability when the bacteria were grown on antibiotic-free medium, whereas, in the second case, r100 was rapidly and preferentially excluded.

AB  == cephapirin sodium, a parenterally administered derivative of cephalosporanic acid, was tested in vitro against 150 stock cultures of enterobacteriaceae and 30 stock cultures each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. both broth- and agar-dilution techniques were employed with two sizes of inocula of organisms. at a concentration of 7.5 mug or less/ml, cephapirin inhibited and killed 100% of strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis and more than 80% of klebsiella species when tested against an inoculum of 10(5) bacterial cells/ml. however, even at 100 mug/ml, only a few isolates of other enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas were inhibited. a 100-fold increase in the inoculum resulted in decreased susceptibility of organisms. all penicillin-susceptible as well as penicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates were inhibited and killed by 5 mug or less of cephapirin/ml when tested with an inoculum of either 10(4) or 10(6) organisms/ml. the drug also was studied in various doses in the treatment of 77 patients with diverse infections. cephapirin was effective in the treatment of 27 of 32 patients with pulmonary infection, as  well as in 6 of 7 patients with staphylococcal or streptococcal soft tissue infection. of 25 patients with urinary-tract infections, 19 developed a negative  culture during therapy. a single 4-g intramuscular dose of cephapirin was effective in only 2 of 11 patients with gonococcal urethritis or endocervicitis.  two patients with gonococcal urethritis treated with multiple injections were cured. the drug was well tolerated except for pain at the site of injection in 14 patients and phlebitis in 4 patients. no abnormalities in renal or hepatic function could be attributed to cephapirin. in addition, no abnormalities were found in the renal tubules of rabbits challenged with 500 mg of cephapirin/kg. if further studies document that cephapirin is well tolerated by the parenteral route, it may have advantages over cephalothin or cephaloridine.

AB  == 7-[alpha-(1-methyl-4-pyridiniothio)-acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, referred to  herein as bl-s 217, is a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that offers several advantages over cephalothin. a comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that bl-s 217 is about eightfold more effective against streptococcus pyogenes and diplococcus pneumoniae. against gram-negative  bacteria, bl-s 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., bl-s 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both escherichia coli and klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against salmonella and enterobacter. overall, of 208 strains of enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to bl-s 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. bl-s 217 was less bound  to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. the ld(50) of bl-s 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. when administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in s. pyogenes and d. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an e. coli infection. its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis.

TI  == molecular hybridization of ribonucleic acid with a large excess of deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  == when rna is annealed in solution with a sufficiently large excess of dna, the kinetics of dna-rna hybridization are relatively simple. methods are described for following the course of both dna renaturation and dna-rna hybridization in this system. to explore the characteristics of the reaction a series of model systems was used. each one utilized dna (sheared to constant size) from a bacterium or bacteriophage and homologous crna, i.e. rna synthesized in vitro on  a template of the same dna. temperature optima were determined for the hybridization of escherichia coli nucleic acids in 2xssc and 3xssc-50% formamide  buffers, and of proteus mirabilis nucleic acids in 2xssc buffer. rate-constants for dna-rna hybridization were measured by two methods. these gave somewhat different results, but in all cases the rate-constant of dna-rna hybridization was clearly less than that of dna renaturation. thus hybridization is a slower reaction than dna renaturation. nevertheless, in some cases, with a high concentration of dna and a long annealing time, 90-95% of the added rna became resistant to ribonuclease. experiments are described which show that it is possible to deduce the analytical complexity of dna with reasonable accuracy from its hybridization with complementary rna. similarly, it is possible to estimate the reiteration frequency of multiple dna sequences (such as ribosomal dna) from  the hybridization of the total dna with rna complementary to the multiple sequences. the effect on the system of various dna/rna ratios from 100 to 1 is described.

AB  == the antibacterial drug nitroakridin 3582 inhibited the growth of selected grampositive bacteria more strongly than it inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacilli. nitroakridin at concentrations of the order of 5 x 10(-5)m induced lysis of bacillus licheniformis and micrococcus lysodeikticus. at concentrations less than 10(-4)m, nitroakridin 3582 reduced the exponential growth rate of escherichia coli c-2; at 10(-4)m the drug was bacteriostatic, and, at concentrations greater than 10(-4)m, it was bactericidal. prolonged bacteriostasis resulted in the formation of long filaments by e. coli, serratia marcescens, shigella sonnei, and proteus mirabilis. the reversible effects of nitroakridin 3582 on the growth of e. coli correlated with partial inhibitions of deoxyribonucleic acid biosynthesis; ribonucleic acid and protein syntheses were inhibited less strongly. nitroakridin 3582 at concentrations greater than 2 x 10(-4)m, which block deoxyribonucleic acid biosynthesis, produced an accelerated  bactericidal action.

TI  == transduction of r factors by a proteus mirabilis bacteriophage.
AB  == a transducing phage, designated phim, was isolated from a lysogenic strain of proteus mirabilis and was characterized with respect to its physical and genetic  properties. the phage contains double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) with an s(20,w) degrees of 29 which corresponds to a molecular weight of 24 x 10(6) daltons. the base composition of phim dna was estimated to be 40% guanine plus cytosine on the basis of the buoyant density of the dna. phim carries out generalized transduction of chromosomal genes in p. mirabilis at a frequency of 5 x 10(-8) to 2 x 10(-6) per adsorbed phage. to obtain r-factor transduction, it was necessary to have a resident r factor in the recipient cells. in these experiments, different combinations of genetically distinguishable r factors were used in the donor and recipient cells. the frequencies of r-factor transduction were 10(-9) to 2 x 10(-8). the transduction of r factors using an r(-) recipient  could not be detected. transductant r factors were usually recombinant between donor and resident r factors. all of the transduced r factors were transferable by conjugation. a plausible explanation for the requirement for a resident r factor in the recipient cells is that phim transduces only a portion of the r-factor genome and therefore requires a resident r factor for genetic recombination. the reason for the low frequencies of r-factor transduction is not known, but some possible interpretations have been discussed.

AB  == a substituted sex-factor of escherichia coli, f'8 gal, was transferred to proteus mirabilis by conjugation. the dna of the episome was partially purified from proteus dna by preparative equilibrium centrifugation in caesium chloride, and by a bulk method using hydroxyapatite. the buoyant density of the episomal dna is 1.707, corresponding to a (g+c) content of 47%. by optical renaturation the genetic complexity of the episomal dna was found to be 76x10(6) daltons. rna was  synthesized in vitro by using the episomal dna as template. by hybridizing this rna with dna extracted from e. coli carrying f'8 gal, it is shown that the number of copies of the episome per replicating chromosome is close to two during exponential growth. the episome makes up about 4.4% of the total dna of the growing cells. the activities of galactokinase and galactose 1-phosphate uridylyl-transferase in cells with and without episomal and chromosomal gal genes were found to be proportional to the number of gal genes present, when the cells  were induced with d-fucose, but not when they were induced with d-galactose.

TI  == circular r-factor molecules controlling penicillinase synthesis, replicating in escherichia coli under either relaxed or stringent control.
AB  == two infectious drug-resistance (r) factors, r28k and r6k, each conferring resistance to a number of penicillins by the synthesis of a penicillinase, were transferred to proteus mirabilis pm1 and escherichia coli rc85 host strains. deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) extracted from these strains was separated by density-gradient centrifugation and subjected to electron microscopy by use of a  modification of the protein-monolayer diffusion technique. analytical density-gradient centrifugation of the purified dna from pm1 strains showed, in addition to the major peak at a density of 1.698 g/cm(3) characteristic of proteus chromosomal dna, a single satellite band at a density of 1.710 g/cm(3) [guanine plus cytosine (gc) base ratio 50%] for r28k and at 1.704 g/cm(3) (gc base ratio 45%) for r6k. direct cscl density-gradient centrifugation of crude lysates of the e. coli (r28k)(+) strain in the presence of ethidium bromide gave  rise to a sedimentation profile with a single satellite peak containing covalently closed circular (ccc) dna molecules with a mean contour length of 21.4 mum [44 x 10(6) atomic mass units (amu)], although a minority was 13.6 mum in length. from the size of the major class, it was estimated that there were two to three copies of the r28k factor present as ccc molecules per chromosome at various phases of cellular growth. similar studies of the e. coli (r6k)(+) lysates showed two satellite peaks; peak i contained mostly ccc molecules of contour length 12.8 mum (26 x 10(6) amu), and peak ii, intermediate to peak i and the chromosomal peak, contained ccc molecules of a similar size, together with about equal numbers of catenated molecules, mostly dimers consisting of two interlocked monomers of 12.8 mum. a smaller number (ca. 0.1%) of higher catenanes was also seen. the number of ccc copies of the r6k factor per chromosome present  in peak i was calculated as 13 at logarithmic phase and 38 at stationary phase. in peak ii, a constant ratio of about one catenated dimer per chromosome was found at all phases of growth. penicillinase assays of cultures at different phases of growth showed a correlation between the estimated number of r-factor copies present as ccc molecules and the enzyme activity per cell for both r28k and r6k.

AB  == the activity of 6-(d-alpha-sulfoaminophenylacetamido)-penicillanic acid was determined against 357 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli by use of the tube-dilution technique. the majority of the isolates of pseudomonas species were inhibited by 200 mug/ml or less of this antibiotic. most of the isolates of escherichia coli had a minimal inhibitory concentration of 50 mug/ml or less. seventy-three per cent of the isolates of p. mirabilis, 40% of the isolates of p. morganii, and 45% of the isolates of enterobacter species were inhibited by 12.5  mug/ml or less, whereas most of the isolates of klebsiella species and serratia species were resistant. the activity of this semisynthetic penicillin was affected by the size of the inoculum. the drug was bactericidal against all isolates of e. coli and proteus species that were sensitive to it, but it was bactericidal against only 32% of the sensitive isolates of pseudomonas species.

TI  == polynucleotide sequence relationships among members of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == polynucleotide relationships were examined among many representatives of the enterobacteriaceae by means of agar, membrane filter, and hydroxyapatite procedures. the amount of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) that reassociated was dependent, especially in interspecific reactions, on the annealing temperature. in only three cases: escherichia coli-shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium-s. typhi, and proteus mirabilis-p. vulgaris, was relative interspecific duplex formation 80% or higher. in most cases interspecies dna duplex formation was 40% or less of that obtained from intraspecies dna reassociation reactions. the stability of e. coli-s. flexneri dna duplexes formed at either 60 or 75 c was virtually identical to that of homologous e. coli dna duplexes, and the degree of interspecies duplex formation was minimally affected  by the temperature increase (86% at 60 c; 77% at 75 c). the thermal stability of  dna duplexes formed at 60 c between dna from e. coli and dna from strains of aerobacter aerogenes, s. typhimurium, s. typhi, and p. mirabilis was about 12 to  14 c below that of reassociated e. coli dna. at 75 c, the formation of the interspecific dna duplexes was markedly decreased, but the stability of the dna able to reassociate at this temperature approximated that of reassociated e. coli dna. the degree of reassociation and the thermal stability of e. coli-s. flexneri dna duplexes suggests relatively little evolutionary divergence in these organisms. the other enterobacteria tested, however, have diverged to a point where less than one-half of their dna can reanneal with e. coli dna at 60 c and less than 10% reacts at 75 c. the degree of divergence between various enterobacteria does not appear to be uniform along the dna molecule. ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rna)-specific sequences are conserved among most enterobacteria. an examination of messenger rna relatively specific for the lactose operon suggests that specific chromosomal genes may diverge more or less  than the genome as a whole.

TI  == trimethoprim--sulphamethoxazole: comparative study in urinary infection in hospital.
AB  == trimethoprim is inhibitory for a wide range of bacteria, and when used in combination with a sulphonamide marked synergy has been reported.in order to test its value in the treatment of urinary infections 154 hospital patients with infections of varying severity and due to a wide range of organisms were treated  with combinations of sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim. combinations of these substances in two different ratios (2:1 and 10:1) were used in 113 patients, and  one week after the end of treatment about three-quarters were cured by both combinations. in a second study 106 patients were treated with a sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination (5:1), ampicillin, or sulphadimidine.  the cure rate with the 5:1 combination was higher than that found with ampicillin or sulphadimidine both one week after finishing treatment (sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim 85%, ampicillin 70%, sulphadimidine 40%) and at the fourth- to fifth-week follow-up (sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim 67%, ampicillin 52%, sulphadimidine 15%).the results obtained with the various sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim combinations did not indicate that a particular ratio was superior for treating urinary infections in general or for those caused by any particular species of organism.laboratory studies showed that many bacteria causing urinary infections in hospital were sensitive to trimethoprim, and the therapeutic results could have been largely predicted from a knowledge of the in-vitro sensitivity tests to trimethoprim alone. for example, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim in the treatment of proteus mirabilis infections was less successful than in those due to escherichia coli, and this finding was clearly reflected in the higher minimal inhibitory concentrations for trimethoprim of pr. mirabilis.the sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination was  simple to administer, free from side-effects, and gave satisfactory results in the treatment of urinary infections that occurred in hospital patients.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephalexin, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin c antibiotic.
AB  == concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. the in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. all strains of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. of the staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all s. aureus, 80% of escherichia coli, 72% of klebsiella-aerobacter, and 56% of proteus mirabilis strains. about 90 to 96% of e. coli, klebsiella aerobacter, and p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. pseudomonas and indole-positive proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. a peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. a mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. food did not interfere with absorption. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. over 90% of the administered dose was excreted  in the urine within 6 hr. the mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group a streptococci, d. pneumoniae, and s. aureus, 85% of e. coli, and about 40 to 75% of klebsiella-aerobacter and p. mirabilis strains. levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of e. coli, and p. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of klebsiella-aerobacter strains.

TI  == antibacterial mechanisms of the urinary bladder.
AB  == the disappearance of bacteria from the normal urinary bladder is apparently a function of two host defense mechanisms: the mechanical clearance of organisms by voiding, and the antibacterial activity of the bladder wall. this study quantified the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms to the resistance of the bladder to bacterial infection.(32)phosphorus-labeled e. coli.  s. aureus, and p. mirabilis were each injected into the urinary bladders of unanesthetized female guinea pigs. at intervals after voiding, the bladders were  removed, washed, homogenized, and assayed for residual radioactivity and viable bacteria. mechanical clearance was measured by the changes in total radioactive count. antibacterial activity was quantified by comparing the bacterial to radioactive ratios of the original bacterial inoculum with similar ratios in the  bladder homogenates. more than 99.9% of the bladder inoculum was rapidly excreted and about 0.1% (10(4)-10(5)) organisms remained attached to the bladder wall. of  those e. coli attached to the bladder, rapid sequential reduction in viability occurred and reached a level of 85% loss at 30 min after inoculation. 4 hr after  challenge, less than 10% of those organisms still attached to the bladder mucosa  remained viable. p. mirabilis was handled with equal facility, but s. aureus showed a reduction in viability of only 46% at 1 hr and 67% at 4 hr after inoculation. 6 hr after infection with s. aureus, 6 of 12 guinea pig bladders showed multiplication of the organisms still attached to the bladder wall; only 1 of 12 animals challenged with e. coli had comparable multiplication. the mechanism whereby the bladder wall kills bacteria is unclear, but it did not appear to be related to an antibacterial activity of urine, clumping of organisms on bladder mucosa, phagocytosis by leukocytes, or serum levels of bactericidal antibody. although it is clear that the bladder exhibits intrinsic antibacterial  properties, the role of this defense mechanism in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection requires further clarification.

TI  == protection by vaccination against pseudomonas infection after thermal injury.
AB  == active immunization is effective in the prophylaxis of pseudomonas septicemia in  burned mice. vaccines were prepared from bacterial cells and growth medium of verder's 10 different o serological types of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, as well as from escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. mice given a tail burn could be significantly protected against a local pseudomonas challenge by both specific and, to a lesser extent, by nonspecific pseudomonas vaccines prepared either from bacterial cells or from the medium in which they were grown. the vaccine was effective when administered prior to or after thermal trauma. after a more extensive rump burn, the protective effect of a specific vaccine given after thermal injury was significant only when the challenge was postponed until 4 days postburn; the level of protection was less than in the mice with smaller burns.

TI  == production of the shwartzman reaction with microbial l forms.
AB  == study of potential pathogenicity of microbial l forms was done by the localized shwartzman reaction. stable l forms of proteus mirabilis served as skin preparation in rabbits for induction of shwartzman reaction by subsequent intravenous injection of either p. mirabilis l forms or escherichia coli endotoxin. the intensity of the reaction was positively correlated to numbers of  l forms in the skin. l forms also served as the intravenous challenge. in vivo multiplication of l forms was not a prerequisite for the reaction, as it could be produced with nonviable, osmotically lysed l forms. the reaction produced with l  forms in the skin was more intense than that produced with the parent bacterial form. these latter observations, coupled with the demonstration that l forms disappeared from the skin (lysed?) after 4 hr, in contrast to bacteria which were recoverable for 72 hr (duration of study), suggest release of endotoxin by l forms as a pathogenic mechanism.

AB  == serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. the in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. all strains of group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes) and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. eighty per cent of the staphylococcus aureus  strains and about 50% of the escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis strains were  inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. klebsiella-aerobacter species were  more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. when single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. a full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. the peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group a streptococci and d. pneumoniae. many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. mirabilis. urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the e. coli and p. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of klebsiella-aerobacter.

TI  == effect of different media on in vitro studies of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == in an effort to determine the adequacy of a standard broth medium in the evaluation of antibiotic combinations, 20 strains of various bacterial species were studied simultaneously in mueller-hinton broth and in freshly drawn human serum from apparently healthy volunteers. studies of growth dynamics by use of the usual plate dilution technique for quantitating colony-forming units were performed with strains of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible), streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, aerobacter, klebsiella, and proteus mirabilis. a variety of different antibiotics were investigated. with 19 of the 20 strains, interpretations of synergism or antagonism were the same in both media. therefore, despite minor variations when  the same strain was studied in both serum and broth, it is concluded that mueller-hinton broth is an adequate medium for use in studies of chemotherapeutic combinations in vitro. a simplified method for studying bactericidal activity is  described, which is deemed practical for clinical microbiology laboratories and which led to the same conclusions regarding the combinations as were obtained by  the more arduous plate dilution test.

TI  == occurrence of chloramphenicol-acetylating enzymes in various gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the occurrence of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme, similar to that found in  escherichia coli, carrying an r factor was investigated in various gram-negative  bacilli. the acetylated products of chloramphenicol were identified by chromatography and quantitatively assayed after benzene extraction. the investigated strains were of the salmonella-arizona group, the klebsiella-aerobacter group, serratia marcescens, the proteus group, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, most of which were isolated from 1947 to 1957. both chloramphenicol-sensitive and -resistant strains were included, but none of them  was able to transfer chloramphenicol resistance by conjugation. in the proteus group, a significant level of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme was found in most strains, whether they were sensitive or resistant to chloramphenicol; the resistant strains showed higher levels of the enzyme. some chloramphenicol-sensitive strains lacked this enzyme. only the sensitive strains  containing the enzyme could easily produce chloramphenicol-resistant mutants with higher enzyme activity. thus, the chloramphenicol resistance of this group can be reasonably explained on the basis of the chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme. all  of the pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to chloramphenicol, and most strains showed low levels of the enzyme (which, however, did not appear sufficient to explain their resistance). all of the strains of the other groups (except one strain of enterobacter cloacae) lacked the enzyme, although most strains of the klebsiella-aerobacter group and of s. marcescens were resistant to chloramphenicol. with respect to the origin of the resistance gene of the r factor, it is noteworthy that the strains of proteus mirabilis isolated in 1947 possessed this enzyme before the discovery of chloramphenicol.

TI  == bacterial interference induced in embryonated eggs by staphylococci.
AB  == studies of experimental infections in embryonated eggs demonstrated that prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci afforded significant protection  against subsequent challenge with virulent strains. all strains of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci tested that were relatively avirulent for embryonated eggs were capable of producing interference. the interference induced afforded protection not only against challenge with virulent staphylococci, but also against diplococcus pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and one strain of influenza virus (a(2)j 305). prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci also protected against intravenous as well as allantoic infection with challenge strains.interference required infection with viable bacteria. the onset of interference appeared within a few minutes after injection of the interfering strain, but was not maximal until 24 hours had elapsed between injection of the interfering and challenge strains. the protection afforded by the production of interference could not be overcome by increased inoculum size of the challenge strain and extended even to challenge with 10(9) bacteria. studies of in vitro and in vivo growth of challenge strains in allantoic fluid demonstrated that some interfering strains inhibited growth of the challenge strains. other strains produced interference without producing prolonged inhibition of the growth of challenge strains. similarly, interference could not be attributed to attenuated  virulence of the challenge organisms. all interfering strains studied produced enhanced bactericidal activity of whole blood from the affected embryos, but whether this affected leukocyte activity, opsonization, or other host defense mechanisms has yet to be determined.

TI  == the role of the microbial flora in uremia. i. survival times of germfree, limited-flora, and conventionalized rats after bilateral nephrectomy and fasting.
AB  == germfree rats were used in 3 experiments to study the effects of the microbial flora on survival time after acute uremia produced by a one-stage bilateral nephrectomy. germfree rats, limited-flora rats, and conventionalized rats (all maintained continuously in isolators) were subjected to nephrectomy or to sham nephrectomy, deprived of food and water until they died, respectively, of uremia  or of starvation, and their survival times compared. to establish a limited defined flora in advance of nephrectomy, germfree rats were either monocontaminated (staphylococcus albus), dicontaminated (s. albus and proteus mirabilis) or tetracontaminated (s. albus, s. faecalis, p. mirabilis, and e. coli); to conventionalize germfree rats, they were exposed to the mixed microbial flora contained in the cecal contents of ordinary rats, which was the source of the aforementioned bacteria and which included other uncharacterized microorganisms as well. the intestine of all rats with a limited flora persisted  in a morphologic state that was virtually no different from that of the germfree  rat, including the presence of an enlarged, thin-walled cecum; by contrast, the intestine of the conventionalized rats permanently assumed the morphological characteristics of ordinary, open-laboratory rats with the cecum reduced to normal size. after nephrectomy and food and water deprivation (death from anuria): (a) all germfree rats but one outlived their conventionalized counterparts in each of the 3 experiments; the 21 germfree rats (127 hr) lived, on the average, 2 days longer than did the 24 conventionalized rats (75 hr). no sex difference was demonstrated. (b) the rats with a limited flora died correspondingly sooner as the complexity of their flora increased; survival time  of the tetracontaminated rats was significantly shorter than that of the germfree rats, and statistically no different from that of the conventionalized rats. after sham nephrectomy and food and water deprivation (delayed death from starvation): (a) all rats, irrespective of microbial status or sex, outlived their fasting nephrectomized partners. the conventionalized rats endured starvation approximately 2.5 wk longer than they did anuria and the germfree rats 1 wk longer. (b) all conventionalized rats, both male and female, outlived their  respective germfree counterparts by about 1 wk. (c) all males, irrespective of microbial status, survived longer than did the females; the average difference was 4 days. the differences in tolerance to anuria or starvation did not correlate with initial body weight or rate of weight loss.

AB  == chang, te-wen (tufts university school of medicine, boston, mass.) and louis weinstein. in vitro biological activity of cephalothin. j. bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. shigella, salmonella, and proteus mirabilis were the most  sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and  herellea were highly resistant. penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of s. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with s. aureus. cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. this antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin g but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.

TI  == the role of immunity in the pathogenesis of experimental hematogenous pyelonephritis.
AB  == hematogenous pyelonephritis was produced in rats utilizing multiple strains of escherichia coli, a strain of klebsiella pneumoniae, and a strain of proteus mirabilis. three patterns of hematogenous pyelonephritis occurred which represent an interrelationship between an immune response to the infecting bacteria and the development of obstructive uropathy as a consequence of infection. first, the course of pyelonephritis due to strains of escherichia coli was acute, self-limited, and associated with the development of circulating agglutinins. following healing, this pattern of infection was associated with acquired resistance to reinfection with the same bacterial strain. second, the course of pyelonephritis due to a strain of klebsiella pneumoniae type c was chronic. this  infection was not associated with the production of circulating agglutinins against encapsulated strains. acquired resistance to reinfection by the homotypic strain could not be demonstrated following eradication of infection but was produced by the passive transfer of concentrated antiserum. third, pyelonephritis due to proteus mirabilis was associated with circulating agglutinins and resistance to reinfection with the same organism following eradication of infection, yet the course was chronic. the chronicity appeared to be the consequence of obstructive uropathy resulting from calculi which developed during the course of the infection. resistance to reinfection was demonstrated in infections with strains of e. coli and p. mirabilis. the resistance is associated with specific immunity as demonstrated by the observation that: (a) it is type-specific, (b) it is of at least 3 months' duration, and (c) it can be passively transferred by means of rabbit antiserum. since k. pneumoniae failed to evoke capsular antibodies in the rat, resistance to infection with k. pneumoniae  was produced only by means of passively transferred concentrated rabbit antiserum and not by prior infection. immunity can be demonstrated to have a significant role in the pathogenesis of experimental hematogenous pyelonephritis only in the  absence of obstructive uropathy.
