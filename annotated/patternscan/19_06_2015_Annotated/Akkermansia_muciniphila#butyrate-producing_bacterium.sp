TI  == microbiota and diabetes: an evolving relationship.
AB  == the gut microbiota affects numerous biological functions throughout the body and  its characterisation has become a major research area in biomedicine. recent studies have suggested that gut bacteria play a fundamental role in diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. data are accumulating in animal  models and humans suggesting that obesity and type 2 diabetes (t2d) are associated with a profound dysbiosis. first human metagenome-wide association studies demonstrated highly significant correlations of specific intestinal bacteria, certain bacterial genes and respective metabolic pathways with t2d. importantly, especially butyrate-producing bacteria such as roseburia intestinalis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii concentrations were lower in t2d subjects. this supports the increasing evidence, that butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids are able to exert profound immunometabolic effects. endotoxaemia, most likely gut-derived has also been observed in patients with metabolic syndrome and t2d and might play a key role in metabolic inflammation. a further hint towards an association between microbiota and t2d has been derived from studies in pregnancy showing that major gut microbial shifts occurring during pregnancy affect host metabolism. interestingly, certain antidiabetic drugs such as metformin also interfere with the intestinal microbiota. specific members of the microbiota such as akkermansia muciniphila might be decreased in diabetes and when administered to murines exerted antidiabetic effects. therefore, as a 'gut signature' becomes more evident in t2d, a better understanding of the role of the microbiota in diabetes might provide new aspects regarding its pathophysiological relevance and pave the way for new therapeutic principles.

TI  == human gut microbiota changes reveal the progression of glucose intolerance.
AB  == to explore the relationship of gut microbiota with the development of type 2 diabetes (t2dm), we analyzed 121 subjects who were divided into 3 groups based on their glucose intolerance status: normal glucose tolerance (ngt; n = 44), prediabetes (pre-dm; n = 64), or newly diagnosed t2dm (n = 13). gut microbiota characterizations were determined with 16s rdna-based high-throughput sequencing. t2dm-related dysbiosis was observed, including the separation of microbial communities and a change of alpha diversity between the different glucose intolerance statuses. to assess the correlation between metabolic parameters and  microbiota diversity, clinical characteristics were also measured and a significant association between metabolic parameters (fpg, crp) and gut microbiota was found. in addition, a total of 28 operational taxonomic units (otus) were found to be related to t2dm status by the kruskal-wallis h test, most of which were enriched in the t2dm group. butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g. akkermansia muciniphila atccbaa-835, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii l2-6) had a higher abundance in the ngt group than in the pre-dm group. at genus level, the abundance of bacteroides in the t2dm group was only half that of the ngt and pre-dm groups. previously reported t2dm-related markers were also compared with the data in this study, and some inconsistencies were noted. we found that verrucomicrobiae may be a potential marker of t2dm as it had a significantly lower abundance in both the pre-dm and t2dm groups. in conclusion, this research  provides further evidence of the structural modulation of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of diabetes.

TI  == stool microbiome and metabolome differences between colorectal cancer patients and healthy adults.
AB  == in this study we used stool profiling to identify intestinal bacteria and metabolites that are differentially represented in humans with colorectal cancer  (crc) compared to healthy controls to identify how microbial functions may influence crc development. stool samples were collected from healthy adults (n =  10) and colorectal cancer patients (n = 11) prior to colon resection surgery at the university of colorado health-poudre valley hospital in fort collins, co. the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was pyrosequenced and both short chain fatty acids and global stool metabolites were extracted and analyzed utilizing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms). there were no significant differences in the overall microbial community structure associated with the disease state, but several bacterial genera, particularly butyrate-producing species, were under-represented in the crc samples, while a mucin-degrading species, akkermansia muciniphila, was about 4-fold higher in crc (p<0.01). proportionately higher amounts of butyrate were seen in stool of healthy individuals while relative concentrations of acetate were higher in stools of crc patients. gc-ms profiling revealed higher concentrations of amino acids in stool samples from crc patients and higher poly and monounsaturated fatty acids and ursodeoxycholic acid, a conjugated bile acid in stool samples from healthy adults (p<0.01). correlative analysis between the combined datasets revealed some potential relationships between stool metabolites and certain bacterial species. these associations could provide insight into microbial functions occurring in a cancer environment and will help direct future mechanistic studies. using integrated "omics" approaches may prove a useful tool in identifying functional groups of gastrointestinal bacteria and their associated metabolites as novel therapeutic and chemopreventive targets.
