TI  == necrotizing periodontal diseases in hiv-infected brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  == objective: nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. method and materials: from a pool of 1,232 hiv-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. the presence and levels of  47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent  than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). the frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. species detected in  high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, dialister pneumosintes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus intermedius, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter rectus. in contrast, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium nodatum, and helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. conclusion: necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in hiv-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular t denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as e faecalis and d pneumosintes. in addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and aids-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == an evaluation of bacterial contamination of barriers used in periapical tissue regeneration: part 2--bacterial penetration.
AB  == objective: to compare the relative penetration of prevotella melaninogenica and enterococcus faecalis through 3 guided tissue regeneration membranes: atrisorb, lambone, and osseoquest. it was hypothesized that osseoquest would show increased bacterial penetration when compared to lambone and atrisorb. method and materials: centrifuge tubes containing trypticase soy broth were sealed with circular sections of membranes and placed in test tubes containing culture media. the bacterial penetration was assessed by passage of bacteria from the outer tube culture media to the inner centrifuge tube media through the membrane. after incubation for 4 and 48 hours, the media from the outer and inner tubes were compared for bacterial count. results: p melaninogenica exhibited 91% penetration for lambone in 2 days, while osseoquest displayed 87% penetration with e faecalis in the same time. atrisorb displayed a minimal penetration with both bacteria (2%). conclusion: atrisorb displayed the least bacterial penetration, which may be attributed to membrane structure, chemical configuration, hydrophobicity, and  porosity of tested membranes.

TI  == an evaluation of bacterial contamination of barriers used in periapical tissue regeneration: part 1--bacterial adherence.
AB  == objective: to compare the adherence of prevotella melaninogenica and enterococcus faecalis to 3 guided tissue regeneration membranes: atrisorb, lambone, and osseoquest. it was hypothesized that osseoquest would show increased bacterial adherence compared to lambone and atrisorb. method and materials: the barriers were suspended in trypticase soy broth containing an inoculum of either p melaninogenica or e faecalis. the samples were incubated under appropriate conditions for 6, 24, and 48 hours. following incubation, each membrane was mixed in fresh media in a vortex machine to dislodge adherent bacteria. the vortexed media was quantitatively assessed using serial dilutions for viable cell count. results: e faecalis exhibited higher adherence compared to p melaninogenica with  time. of the membranes tested, lambone displayed the least bacterial adherence. conclusion: an analysis of the results indicated that bacterial adherence was time-dependent for all membranes. membrane structure, chemical configuration, hydrophobicity, and bacterial cell surface structure were suggested as factors contributing to variance in bacterial adherence.

TI  == pcr-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using pcr method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. study design: a total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. the presence of selected pathogens (actinomyces israelii, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus intermedius, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, tannerella forsythensis, enterococcus faecium, prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using pcr. results: t. denticola (p = .012, .02) and e. faecalis (p = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while p. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (p = .01, .015). conclusion: the results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with  clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  == since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (pmc) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola and prevotella melaninogenica. the mic of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the mic of pmc from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. the highest mic value of pmc was detected for e. faecalis whereas e. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. the highest mic values of chlorhexidine  were observed for p. aeruginosa whereas e. coli and p. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. since the mic values observed are much  lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.

TI  == [severe orbital cellulitis: therapeutic results in 9 patients and review of the literature].
AB  == background: orbital cellulitis can produce severe neuromeningeal infections. modern antimicrobial agents such as imipenem can be a valid therapeutical choice. methods: patients with severe or complicated orbital cellulitis admitted to our hospital from 1986 through 1994 were retrospectively studied. results: nine patients with severe orbital cellulitis, seven of them older than 14 years, are reported. cellulitis was secondary to different forms of sinusitis in five of them. the incriminated microorganisms were: streptococcus viridans alone or combined to gram negative bacilli (3 cases), prevotella melaninogenica and other  anaerobes (2 cases), enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus (one case each). three patients developed brain abscesses, one an acute bacterial meningitis and another a subdural empyema. eight patients underwent a surgical drainage. seven patients were treated with iv imipenem at doses of 2-3 g/day with complete cure of the orbital cellulitis and of the associated infectious complications and no secondary effects. two patients died. conclusions: imipenem  is an effective antibiotic in the combined medical-surgical treatment of the severe or complicated orbital cellulitis.

TI  == the endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  == the microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. a  total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then prevotella melaninogenica (formerly bacteroides melaninogenicus), enterococcus faecalis and  prevotella oralis (formerly bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. highly significant associations were discovered between four  pairs of species, viz p. melaninogenica with p. micros, p. melaninogenica with p. oralis, prevotella corporis with streptococcus morbillorum and actinomyces odontolyticus with e. faecalis.

TI  == [the bactericidal efficiency of ultrasonic in the root canal].
AB  == the objective of this paper was to determine the quantitative bactericidal efficiency of ultrasonic in the root canal. four test organisms found frequently  in the root canal were compared. the result showed ultrasonic can kill the test organisms effectively in the root canals. the best bactericidal efficiency occurred at 4 or 5 min. of ultrasonic though the more efficiency as the time longer. bactericidal irrigation could increase the bactericidal efficiency of ultrasonic and its bactericidal action similar to irrigation bactericidal property.

TI  == bacterial invasion of pulpal dentin wall in vitro.
AB  == instrumented root canals of extracted human teeth were inoculated with known pulpal bacterial isolates. the inoculated teeth were immersed in the appropriate  culture media and incubated at 37 degrees c for varying periods. streptococci multiplied in the root canals and invaded the radicular dentinal tubules. the extent of bacterial invasion was time-dependent. this experimental model of bacterial invasion was time-dependent. this experimental model may be useful in investigating the effect of intra-canal medicaments on microorganisms lodged in the pulpal dentin wall.
