TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == preventive effect of lactobacillus reuteri crl1324 on group b streptococcus vaginal colonization in an experimental mouse model.
AB  == aims: to assess the preventive effect of different intravaginal (i.va.) doses of  lactobacillus reuteri crl1324 against vaginal colonization by group b streptococcus (gbs) in a murine experimental model. methods and results: the major virulence factors of four vaginal gbs clinical isolates were determined to  select the most virulent strain and set up a murine model of streptococcal vaginal colonization. later, the effect of four and seven doses of 10(8) viable cells of lact. reuteri crl1324 i.va. administered, prior to the gbs challenge was studied. seven doses of lactobacilli were able to significantly reduce the number of viable gbs cells, while four doses showed no preventive effect. both doses reduced the leucocyte influx induced by gbs. seven doses caused a slight increase in the lact. reuteri crl1324 vaginal colonization compared with four doses and reduced murine vaginal ph compared to control mice. conclusions: lactobacillus reuteri crl1324 evidenced a preventive effect on gbs vaginal colonization in an experimental mouse model. significance and impacts of the study: maternal gbs colonization is one of the most important risk factors for developing disease in  newborns. lactobacillus reuteri crl1324 could be considered as a new biological agent to reduce infections caused by this micro-organism.

TI  == one-step high-efficiency crispr/cas9-mediated genome editing in streptomyces.
AB  == the rna-guided dna editing technology crisprs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/cas9 had been used to introduce double-stranded breaks into genomes and to direct subsequent site-specific insertions/deletions or the replacement of genetic material in bacteria, such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumonia, and lactobacillus reuteri. in this study, we established a high-efficiency crispr/cas9 genome editing plasmid pkccas9do for use in streptomyces genetic manipulation, which comprises a target-specific guide rna, a codon-optimized cas9, and two homology-directed repair templates. by delivering pkccas9do series editing plasmids into the model strain streptomyces coelicolor m145, through one-step intergeneric transfer, we achieved the genome editing at different levels with high efficiencies of 60%-100%, including single gene deletion, such as actii-orf4, redd, and glnr, and single large-size gene cluster  deletion, such as the antibiotic biosynthetic clusters of actinorhodin (act) (21.3 kb), undecylprodigiosin (red) (31.6 kb), and ca(2+)-dependent antibiotic (82.8 kb). furthermore, we also realized simultaneous deletions of actii-orf4 and redd, and of the act and red biosynthetic gene clusters with high efficiencies of 54% and 45%, respectively. finally, we applied this system to introduce nucleotide point mutations into the rpsl gene, which conferred the mutants with resistance to streptomycin. notably, using this system, the time required for one round of genome modification is reduced by one-third or one-half of those for conventional methods. these results clearly indicate that the established crispr/cas9 genome editing system substantially improves the genome editing efficiency compared with the currently existing methods in streptomyces, and it has promise for application to genome modification in other actinomyces species.

TI  == genetic determinants of reutericyclin biosynthesis in lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == reutericyclin is a unique antimicrobial tetramic acid produced by some strains of lactobacillus reuteri. this study aimed to identify the genetic determinants of reutericyclin biosynthesis. comparisons of the genomes of reutericyclin-producing l. reuteri strains with those of non-reutericyclin-producing strains identified a genomic island of 14 open reading frames (orfs) including genes coding for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (nrps), a polyketide synthase (pks), homologues of phla, phlb, and phlc, and putative transport and regulatory proteins. the protein encoded by rtcn is composed of a condensation domain, an adenylation domain likely specific for d-leucine, and a thiolation domain. rtck codes for a pks that is composed of a ketosynthase domain, an acyl-carrier protein domain, and a thioesterase domain. the products of rtca, rtcb, and rtcc are homologous to the diacetylphloroglucinol-biosynthetic proteins phlabc and may acetylate the tetramic acid moiety produced by rtcn and rtck, forming reutericyclin. deletion of rtcn or rtcabc in l. reuteri tmw1.656 abrogated reutericyclin production but did not affect resistance to reutericyclin. genes coding for transport and regulatory proteins could be deleted only in the reutericyclin-negative l. reuteri strain tmw1.656deltartcn, and these deletions eliminated reutericyclin resistance. the genomic analyses suggest that the reutericyclin genomic island was horizontally acquired from an unknown source during a unique event. the combination of phlabc homologues with both an nrps and a pks has also been identified in the lactic acid bacteria streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus plantarum, suggesting that the genes in these organisms and those in l. reuteri share an evolutionary origin.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of lactobacillus reuteri on cariogenic bacteria streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, and periodontal diseases actinomyces naeslundii and tannerella forsythia.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are well known for their beneficial effects on human health in the intestine and immune system; however, there are few studies on the  impact they can generate in oral health. the aim of this study was to test and compare in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. reuteri on pathogenic bacteria involved in the formation of dental caries: s. mutans, s. gordonii, and periodontal disease: a. naeslundii and t. forsythia. also, we determined the growth kinetics of each bacterium involved in this study. before determining the  antimicrobial action of l. reuteri on cariogenic bacteria and periodontal disease, the behavior and cell development time of each pathogenic bacterium were studied. once the conditions for good cell growth of each of selected pathogens were established according to their metabolic requirements, maximum exponential growth was determined, this being the reference point for analyzing the development or inhibition by lab using the kirby bauer method. chlorhexidine 0.12 % was positive control. l. reuteri was shown to have an inhibitory effect against s. mutans, followed by t. forsythia and s. gordonii, and a less significant effect against a. naeslundii. regarding the effect shown by l. reuteri on the two major pathogens, we consider its potential use as a possible functional food in the prevention or treatment of oral diseases.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus reuteri-derived biosurfactant on the gene expression profile of essential adhesion genes (gtfb, gtfc and ftf) of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == background: streptococci are the main causative agents in plaque formation and mutans streptococci are the principle etiological agent of dental plaque and caries. the process of biofilm formation is a step-wise process, starting with adhesion of planktonic cells to the surfaces. it is now a well known fact that expression of glucosyltransferases (gtfs) and fructosyltransferase (ftf) genes play a critical role in the initial adhesion of streptococcus mutans to the tooth surface, which results in the formation of dental plaques and consequently caries and other periodontal diseases. materials and methods: in the present study, we have determined the effect of biosurfactants purified from lactobacillus reuteri  (dsm20016) culture on gene expression profile of gftb/c and fft of s. mutans (atcc35668) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: the  application of biosurfactant caused considerable down-regulation of the expression of all three genes under study. the reduction in gene expression was statistically very significant (p > 0.0001 for all three genes). conclusions: inhibition of these genes by the extracted l. reuteri biosurfactant shows the emergence of a powerful alternative to the presently practicing alternatives. in  view of the importance of these gene products for s. mutans attachment to the tooth surface, which is the initial important step in biofilm production and dental caries, we believe that the biosurfactant prepared in this study could be  considered as a step ahead in dental caries prevention.

TI  == crispr-cas9-assisted recombineering in lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (crisprs) and the crispr-associated (cas) nuclease protect bacteria and archeae from foreign dna by site-specific cleavage of incoming dna. type-ii crispr-cas systems, such as the streptococcus pyogenes crispr-cas9 system, can be adapted such that cas9 can be guided to a user-defined site in the chromosome to introduce double-stranded breaks. here we have developed and optimized crispr-cas9 function in the lactic acid bacterium lactobacillus reuteri atcc pta 6475. we established proof-of-concept showing that crispr-cas9 selection combined with single-stranded dna (ssdna) recombineering is a realistic approach to identify at high efficiencies edited cells in a lactic acid bacterium. we show for three independent targets that subtle changes in the bacterial genome can be recovered  at efficiencies ranging from 90 to 100%. by combining crispr-cas9 and recombineering, we successfully applied codon saturation mutagenesis in the l. reuteri chromosome. also, crispr-cas9 selection is critical to identify low-efficiency events such as oligonucleotide-mediated chromosome deletions. this also means that crispr-cas9 selection will allow identification of recombinant cells in bacteria with low recombineering efficiencies, eliminating the need for  ssdna recombineering optimization procedures. we envision that crispr-cas genome  editing has the potential to change the landscape of genome editing in lactic acid bacteria, and other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == development of a non-dairy probiotic fermented product based on almond milk and inulin.
AB  == a new fermented almond "milk" that combined the properties of both almonds and probiotics was considered to cover the current versatile health-promoting foods'  demand. almond milk fermentation with probiotic lactobacillus reuteri and streptococcus thermophilus was studied by using a central composite design with response surface methodology, and different factors (glucose, fructose, inulin and starters) were optimised to assure high probiotic survivals in the final product. the optimal formulation was physicochemically characterised throughout cold storage (28 days) and both probiotic survivals to in vitro digestion and proteolysis were quantified. results showed that a high probiotic population (>107 cfu/ml) was obtained in the previously optimised almond milk throughout storage time, which correspond to the addition of 0.75 g of glucose/100 ml, 0.75  g of fructose/100 ml, 2 g/100 ml inulin and 6 ml/100 ml inoculum. glucose was used as the main nutrient and the production of mannitol by l. reuteri was detected. the fermentation process increased the viscosity values, forming a weak gel structure, whose physical properties hardly changed. probiotic bacteria notably survived (51%) to the in vitro digestion, surely related to the inulin presence, which would add value to the developed product by enhancing the potential health benefits of its consumption.

TI  == investigation of probiotic bacteria as dental caries and periodontal disease biotherapeutics.
AB  == oral diseases, specifically dental caries and periodontal disease, are characterised by increases in pathogenic microorganisms, increased demineralisation and increased inflammation and levels of inflammatory markers. despite the therapeutic strategies, oral diseases have elevated prevalence rates. recent work has demonstrated that probiotic bio-therapeutics can decrease oral pathogen counts, including caries-causing streptococcus mutans and oral inflammation. the aim of this work was to investigate putative probiotic bacteria, selected for s. mutans inhibition and for their oral health-promoting characteristics. the probiotic bacteria were screened for s. mutans inhibition, probiotic bacteriocin activity, salivary ph modulation, probiotic nutrient (sucrose) competition, probiotic co-aggregation with s. mutans, bacterial attachment to oral epithelial keratinocytes, bacterial nitric oxide production and bacterial antioxidant activity. the results indicate that lactobacillus reuteri strains ncimb 701359, ncimb 701089, ncimb 702655 and ncimb 702656 inhibited s. mutans to non-detectable levels (<10 cfu/ml). l. reuteri strains also demonstrated the highest antioxidant capacity of the tested strains (7.73-13.99 microm trolox equivalents), suggesting their use as both caries and periodontal disease therapeutics. although lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221 inhibited s. mutans at lower levels, it significantly buffered the ph (4.18) of saliva containing s. mutans, co-aggregated with s. mutans (10.09%), demonstrated  high levels of sucrose consumption (138.11 mm) and successfully attached to gingival epithelial cells (11%). this study identified four l. reuteri strains and one l. fermentum strain to be further investigated as oral disease biotherapeutics.

TI  == probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (ph, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees c), as well as sensory preference among them. decreases in ph (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. only the yogurt  with s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and l. reuteri differed in  firmness. no differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. no changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. counts of s. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. counts of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/ml for 3 wk. probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of l. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/ml for 35 d, of l. casei for 7d, and of l. reuteri for 14 d. we found no significant sensory preference among  the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. however, the yogurt and fermented milk made with l. casei were better accepted. this study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.

TI  == the growth of streptococcus mutans in different milks for infant feeding.
AB  == after birth various bacterial species, mainly streptococci, colonize the oral cavity and are frequently isolated from carious lesions in children. previous studies suggest that an earlier colonization of a child's mouth by cariogenic organisms might be related to a higher risk of caries. the aim of this study is to assess the influence of different milks for infant feeding on the growth of streptococcus mutans (sm) colonies. three human milk samples from three different mothers and five infant formulas were tested. to prepare the bacterial inoculum,  sm was grown in brain heart infusion broth for 18 hours at 37 degrees c in microaerophilic atmosphere. the growth of sm was determined immediately after the inoculation of milks (t0) and after 24 hours (t24) of incubation. after 24 hours  of incubation (deltat= cfus/ml at t24 cfus/ml at t0) the bacterial growth changes were different among milks. among the complementary milks tested, deltat of formulas supplemented with lactobacillus reuteri and with bifidobacterium lactis  was lower than those of non-supplemented formula. in conclusion, on the basis of  the reduced sm growth in milks supplemented with probiotics, we may speculate that these formulas have a preventive effect on the development of caries in children.

TI  == effectiveness of crt at measuring the salivary level of bacteria in caries prone  children with probiotic therapy.
AB  == aim: this irb approved clinical trial was to determine the effect of "over the counter" probiotic supplements on the caries risk test- crt- (ivoclar) results of the oral microflora in high caries risk children. study design: sixty subjects 6  to 12 years old with a caries risk assessment (cambra) of moderate to high (caries prone) were evaluated by an analysis of the difference in the salivary levels of pathogenic bacteria (mutans streptococci and lactobacilli). the subjects were randomly selected by randomizing software and assigned to two diferent groups. group a used periobalance (lactobacilli reuteri-cfu of 200 million) lozenges for 28 days. group b used the evorakids (streptococcus uberis kj2, streptococcus oralis kj3, streptococcus rattus jh1 45, > or = 100 million) probiotics chewable tablets for 30 days. salivary samples were collected then incubated for 48 hours for colony counting and ranking. follow up testing with the crt was performed after 60 days at a follow up visit. results: there was a statistically significant diference in the crt results between the pre and post use of the probiotics. periobalance; sm results t= -6. 78, p< .0001, lactobacilli results t= -5.762, p< .0001, evorakids smresults t= -7.33, p< .0001, lactobacilli results t= -2.952, p= .0068. conclusions: the crt values obtained with caries prone children may be significantly affected by probiotic use. based on this study's results the following conclusions can be made: both evorakids and periobalance affected the crt results by significantly decreasing the number of s. mutans and lactobacilli present in the salivary samples.

TI  == in situ enrichment of folate by microorganisms in beta-glucan rich oat and barley matrices.
AB  == the objective was to study folate production of yeast strains, bacteria isolated  from oat bran, and selected lactic acid bacteria as well as one propionibacterium in oat and barley based models. simultaneously, we aimed at sustaining the stability of viscosity, representing the physicochemical state of beta-glucan. total folate contents were determined microbiologically and vitamers for selected samples by uhplc. folate in yeast cells comprised mainly 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate. folate production by microbes in ypd medium was different to that in cereal fermentations where vitamers included 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate and formylated derivatives. microbes producing significant amounts of folate without affecting viscosity were saccharomyces cerevisiae alko743 and candida milleri abm4949 among yeasts and pseudomonas sp. on8 and janthinobacterium sp. rb4 among bacteria. net folate production was up to 120 ng/g after 24 h fermentation and could increase during 2-week storage. glucose addition increased the proportion of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. streptococcus thermophilus abm5097, lactobacillus reuteri, and propionibacterium  sp. abm5378 produced folate but in lower concentrations. both endogenous and added microbes contribute to folate enhancement. selection of microbes with folate producing capability and limited hydrolytic activity will enable the development of products rich in folate and beta-glucan.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == optimisation of oat milk formulation to obtain fermented derivatives by using probiotic lactobacillus reuteri microorganisms.
AB  == functional advantages of probiotics combined with interesting composition of oat  were considered as an alternative to dairy products. in this study, fermentation  of oat milk with lactobacillus reuteri and streptococcus thermophilus was analysed to develop a new probiotic product. central composite design with response surface methodology was used to analyse the effect of different factors  (glucose, fructose, inulin and starters) on the probiotic population in the product. optimised formulation was characterised throughout storage time at 4 in  terms of ph, acidity, beta-glucan and oligosaccharides contents, colour and rheological behaviour. all formulations studied were adequate to produce fermented foods and minimum dose of each factor was considered as optimum. the selected formulation allowed starters survival above 10(7)/cfu ml to be considered as a functional food and was maintained during the 28 days controlled. beta-glucans remained in the final product with a positive effect on viscosity. therefore, a new probiotic non-dairy milk was successfully developed in which high probiotic survivals were assured throughout the typical yoghurt-like shelf life.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == oral administration of lactobacillus reuteri during the first year of life reduces caries prevalence in the primary dentition at 9 years of age.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on oral health, at age 9 years,  of daily oral supplementation with the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri, strain atcc 55730, to mothers during the last month of gestation and to children through the first year of life. the study was a single-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial involving 113 children: 60 in the probiotic and 53 in the placebo group. the subjects underwent clinical and radiographic examination of the primary dentition and carious lesions, plaque and gingivitis were recorded. saliva and plaque were sampled for determination of mutans streptococci (ms) and  lactobacilli (lb) in saliva and plaque as well as salivary secretory iga (siga).  forty-nine (82%) children in the probiotic group and 31 (58%) in the placebo group were caries-free (p < 0.01). the prevalence of approximal caries lesions was lower in the probiotic group (0.67 +/- 1.61 vs. 1.53 +/- 2.64; p < 0.05) and  there were fewer sites with gingivitis compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05).  there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to frequency of toothbrushing, plaque and dietary habits, but to intake of fluoride  supplements (p < 0.05). there were no intergroup differences with respect to l. reuteri, ms, lb or siga in saliva. within the limitation of this study it seems that daily supplementation with l. reuteri from birth and during the first year of life is associated with reduced caries prevalence and gingivitis score in the  primary dentition at 9 years of age.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus reuteri pta 5289 and l. paracasei dsmz16671 on the adhesion and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == probiotics have decreased the counts of salivary mutans streptococci (ms) in clinical studies. the aim of this study was to compare the effects of lactobacillus reuteri pta 5289 and l. paracasei dsmz16671 on the adhesion of a reference strain and a clinical isolate of streptococcus mutans and on the counts of ms in a biofilm. the adhesion of s. mutans ingbritt and the clinical isolate s. mutans 2366 to a smooth glass surface and saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) were studied in the presence of and without the lactobacilli. a three-species biofilm formed on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs was used in the biofilm experiments. the lactobacilli did not affect adhesion to the glass surface but interfered with binding to sha. no effects of the lactobacilli were detected on the ms levels in the three-species biofilms. the results of the sha binding experiments best reflected the results of the existing clinical studies.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri influences regrowth of mutans streptococci after full-mouth disinfection: a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.
AB  == this study assessed whether the persistence of lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and atcc pta 5289 in saliva could delay the regrowth of mutans streptococci (ms)  after a full-mouth disinfection with chlorhexidine (chx). a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 6-week intervention period and 3- and 6-month follow-up was performed. 62 healthy subjects with moderate to high counts of ms were randomly assigned to a test group (n = 32) or a placebo group (n = 30). before onset of the intervention, subjects received two sessions of professional cleaning, flossing, and application of chx varnish and rinsed their  mouth with a chx solution between the sessions (2 days). thereafter, the test group used probiotic lozenges (2/day) containing l. reuteri (dsm 17938 and atcc pta 5289; 1 x 10(8) cfu of each strain), and the placebo group used identical lozenges lacking the lactobacilli. saliva samples were collected and cultured onto selective media, and isolates of l. reuteri as well as dna directly extracted from saliva were tested by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with specific primers. presence of salivary ms was analysed with a chair-side test. l. reuteri was frequently detected by culture during the intervention period but in  only 3 test group subjects at follow-ups. regrowth of ms statistically significantly differed depending on the presence or absence of l. reuteri dsm 17938 detected by pcr. we conclude that cultivable l. reuteri strains may only sporadically be confirmed after termination of the intervention, but subjects with pcr-detected l. reuteri demonstrated slower regrowth of ms.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == acid production in dental plaque after exposure to probiotic bacteria.
AB  == background: the increasing interest in probiotic lactobacilli in health maintenance has raised the question of potential risks. one possible side effect  could be an increased acidogenicity in dental plaque. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of probiotic lactobacilli on plaque lactic acid (la) production in vitro and in vivo. methods: in the first part (a), suspensions of two lactobacilli strains (l. reuteri dsm 17938, l. plantarum 299v) were added to  suspensions of supragingival dental plaque collected from healthy young adults (n=25). la production after fermentation with either xylitol or fructose was analyzed. in the second part (b), subjects (n=18) were given lozenges with probiotic lactobacilli (l. reuteri dsm 17938 and atcc pta 5289) or placebo for two weeks in a double-blinded, randomized cross-over trial. the concentration of  la in supragingival plaque samples was determined at baseline and after 2 weeks.  salivary counts of mutans streptococci (ms) and lactobacilli were estimated with  chair-side methods. results: plaque suspensions with l. reuteri dsm 17938 produced significantly less la compared with l. plantarum 299v or controls (p<0.05). fructose gave higher la concentrations than xylitol. in part b, there were no significant differences in la production between baseline and follow up in any of the groups and no differences between test and placebo were displayed.  the salivary ms counts were not significantly altered during the intervention but the lactobacilli counts increased significantly in the test group (p<0.05). conclusion: lactic acid production in suspensions of plaque and probiotic lactobacilli was strain-dependant and the present study provides no evidence of an increase in plaque acidity by the supply of selected probiotic lactobacilli when challenged by fructose or xylitol. the study protocol was approved by the danish national committee on biomedical research ethics (protocol no h-2-2010-112). trial registration: nct01700712.

TI  == probiotic lactobacillus reuteri strains atcc pta 5289 and atcc 55730 differ in their cariogenic properties in vitro.
AB  == objective: the effects of probiotics on cariogenic biofilms remain controversial. our aim was to characterise two probiotic lactobacillus reuteri strains, atcc pta 5289 and atcc 55730 from a cariogenic standpoint in vitro. these strains are used in commercial products designed for oral health purposes. design: the adhesion and biofilm formation were studied on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. the effects of glucose or sucrose on the biofilm formation were also tested. arginine metabolism was assessed by measuring the ph in the presence of glucose and arginine. the degradation of hydroxyapatite was measured in three different growth media. streptococcus mutans strains ingbritt and mt 8148 were used as positive controls for bacterial adhesion and degradation of hydroxyapatite. results: strain atcc pta 5289 adhered on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and formed  detectable biofilm, but strain atcc 55730 was poor in both adhesion and biofilm formation. both strains were arginolytic and raised the ph in the presence of arginine. the amount of dissolved calcium from hydroxyapatite correlated with bacterial growth rate and the final ph of the growth medium. conclusion: l. reuteri strains atcc pta 5289 and atcc 55730 differed in their adhesion, biofilm  formation and arginine metabolism in vitro. thus, these probiotic lactobacilli are likely to differ in their behaviour and cariogenic potential also in an oral  environment.

TI  == bacterial species-characteristic profiles of molecular species, and the antigenicity of phospholipids and glycolipids in symbiotic lactobacillus, staphylococcus and streptococcus species.
AB  == human symbiotic bacteria, lactobacillus reuteri (lr) in the intestines, staphylococcus epidermidis (se) in skin and streptococcus salivalis (ss) in the oral cavity, contain dihexaosyl diglycerides (dh-dg) in concentrations equivalent to those of phosphatidyl glycerol (pg) and cardiolipin (cl), together with mono-  to tetrahexaosyl dgs. the molecular species, as the combination of fatty acids in the dg moiety, were revealed to be bacterial species-characteristic, but to be similar between glycolipids and phospholipids in individual bacteria, the major ones being 16:0 and cy19:0 for lr, ai15:0 and ai17:0 for se, and 16:0 and 18:1 for ss, respectively. the carbohydrate structures of dh-dgs were also bacterial species-characteristic, being galalpha1-2glcalpha for lr, glcbeta1-6glcbeta for se, and glcalpha1-2glcalpha for ss, respectively. also, bacterial glycolipids were revealed to provide antigenic determinants characteristic of bacterial species on immunization of rabbits with the respective bacteria. anti-l. johnsonii antiserum intensely reacted with tri- and tetrahexaosyl dgs, in which galalpha was bound to dh-dg through an alpha1-6 linkage, as well as with dh-dg from lr. although anti-se antiserum preferentially reacted with dh-dg from se, anti-ss antiserum reacted with dh-dg from ss and, to a lesser extent, with dh-dgs from lr and se. but, both anti-se and anti-ss antiserum did not react at all with monohexaosyl dg or glycosphingolipids with the same carbohydrates at the nonreducing terminals. in addition, 75 % of human sera, irrespective of the abo blood group, were found to contain igm to tri- and tetrahexaosyl dgs from lr, but not to dh-dgs from lr, se and ss.

TI  == complete genome sequence, lifestyle, and multi-drug resistance of the human pathogen corynebacterium resistens dsm 45100 isolated from blood samples of a leukemia patient.
AB  == background: corynebacterium resistens was initially recovered from human infections and recognized as a new coryneform species that is highly resistant to antimicrobial agents. bacteremia associated with this organism in immunocompromised patients was rapidly fatal as standard minocycline therapies failed. c. resistens dsm 45100 was isolated from a blood culture of samples taken from a patient with acute myelocytic leukemia. the complete genome sequence of c. resistens dsm 45100 was determined by pyrosequencing to identify genes contributing to multi-drug resistance, virulence, and the lipophilic lifestyle of this newly described human pathogen. results: the genome of c. resistens dsm 45100 consists of a circular chromosome of 2,601,311 bp in size and the 28,312-bp plasmid pja144188. metabolic analysis showed that the genome of c. resistens dsm  45100 lacks genes for typical sugar uptake systems, anaplerotic functions, and a  fatty acid synthase, explaining the strict lipophilic lifestyle of this species.  the genome encodes a broad spectrum of enzymes ensuring the availability of exogenous fatty acids for growth, including predicted virulence factors that probably contribute to fatty acid metabolism by damaging host tissue. c. resistens dsm 45100 is able to use external l-histidine as a combined carbon and  nitrogen source, presumably as a result of adaptation to the hitherto unknown habitat on the human skin. plasmid pja144188 harbors several genes contributing to antibiotic resistance of c. resistens dsm 45100, including a tetracycline resistance region of the tet w type known from lactobacillus reuteri and streptococcus suis. the tet(w) gene of pja144188 was cloned in corynebacterium glutamicum and was shown to confer high levels of resistance to tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline in vitro. conclusions: the detected gene repertoire  of c. resistens dsm 45100 provides insights into the lipophilic lifestyle and virulence functions of this newly recognized pathogen. plasmid pja144188 revealed a modular architecture of gene regions that contribute to the multi-drug resistance of c. resistens dsm 45100. the tet(w) gene encoding a ribosomal protection protein is reported here for the first time in corynebacteria. cloning of the tet(w) gene mediated resistance to second generation tetracyclines in c. glutamicum, indicating that it might be responsible for the failure of minocycline therapies in patients with c. resistens bacteremia.

TI  == probiotic supplements (lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and atcc pta 5289) do not  affect regrowth of mutans streptococci after full-mouth disinfection with chlorhexidine: a randomized controlled multicenter trial.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of tablets containing  two probiotic lactobacillus reuteri strains in inhibiting regrowth of salivary mutans streptococci (ms) after full-mouth disinfection (fmd) with chlorhexidine.  the null hypothesis was that the levels of ms would not differ in comparison with a placebo protocol. the study population was comprised of 62 young adults (mean age 23 years) with moderate or high counts of salivary ms who volunteered after informed consent. the study was a double-blinded randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. after a 3-day chlorhexidine regimen, the subjects were randomly assigned to a test group (n = 32) with probiotic lozenges (2/day) or a placebo group (n = 30). the intervention period was 6 weeks, and stimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline and after 1, 6, and 12 weeks. the samples were processed for ms by a chair-side test and dna-dna hybridization as an estimate of 19 bacterial strains associated with oral health and disease. there was no significant difference between the groups at inclusion, and fmd reduced the salivary ms levels significantly in both groups. the ms suppression lasted less than 6 weeks and there were no statistical differences in salivary ms regrowth between the test and control groups at any of the follow-ups. likewise, there were no major differences in the regrowth patterns of the checkerboard panel between the two groups. we conclude that daily oral administration of l. reuteri  did not seem to affect or delay the regrowth of salivary ms after fmd with chlorhexidine.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == construction of theta-type shuttle vector for leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pcb42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  == the pcb42 plasmid from leuconostoc citreum cb2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) was constructed. the pcb42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low g+c content, and no single-stranded dna intermediates during replication, which indicates that pcb42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. in silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 dna-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. the fragment encompassing orf5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. this plasmid was capable of replicating in various lab, including l. citreum, l.  mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. reuteri, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, weissella confusa, and oenococcus oeni. the lab-e. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pcb42 and pek104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pleucm42, showed a high segregational stability in l. citreum cb2567 after 100 generations of cell division. by using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, l. citreum cb2567. the pleucm42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering  of various strains of lab.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == characterization of novel glycolipid antigens with an alpha-galactose epitope in  lactobacilli detected with rabbit anti-lactobacillus antisera and occurrence of antibodies against them in human sera.
AB  == anti-lactobacillus johnsonii (lj) antisera generated by immunization of rabbits with lj reacted with glyceroglycolipids in lj, i.e. dihexaosyl diacylglycerol (dh-dg), trihexaosyl dg (th-dg) and tetrahexaosyl dg (teth-dg), whose reactivities with antisera increased proportionally with longer carbohydrate chains of glycolipids. structural analyses of glycolipids from lj revealed that dh-dg was galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg, and th-dg and teth-dg were novel derivatives of it with alpha-gal at the non-reducing terminal, i.e. galalpha1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg and galalpha1-6galalpha1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg, respectively. dh-dg was commonly present in several lactobacilli examined, but teth-dg was restricted to lj, l. intestinalis and l. reuteri, while the th-dgs from l. casei were glc1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg and an esterified derivative of it, glc1-6galalpha1-2glc(6-fatty acid)alpha1-3'dg, as reported in the literature. anti-lj antisera reacted with th-dg and esterified th-dg from l. casei to lesser  extents, but not at all with gentibiosyl dg from staphylococcus epidermidis or kojibiosyl dg from streptococcus salivalis or sphingoglycolipids containing alpha-gal residues. the major molecular species of glycolipids obtained from lactobacilli were 11-octadecenoic and 11,12-methylene-octadecanoic acids-containing ones. also, human igm antibodies against th-dg and teth-dg from  lj were detected in human sera, with various antibody titres, indicating that an  immune reaction to symbiotic lactobacilli occurs against their glycolipid antigens, th-dg and teth-dg.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilms. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of s. mutans biofilms. these antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. in addition, l. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.

TI  == increased dietary zinc oxide changes the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the ileum of piglets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of increased dietary zno on the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the small intestine of piglets that were fed diets containing a total of 124 or 3,042 mg of zn per kilogram of diet, respectively. zinc was supplemented to the basal diet as zno. bacterial 16s rrna genes of ileal dna extracts were pcr-amplified with 2 bar-coded primer sets and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. the bacterial core species were calculated from the relative abundances of reads present in 5 of 6 samples per group and at a minimum of 5 sequences per sample. the reference database silva was used to assign sequence reads at an alignment minimum of 200 bases and 100% identity. lactic acid bacteria dominated the bacterial core, but showed diverse responses to dietary zno. of the dominant lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus reuteri was reduced due to increased dietary zno (44.7 vs. 17.9%; p=0.042), but l. amylovorus was not influenced. however, the changes of relative  abundances of other lactic acid bacteria were more noteworthy; weissella cibaria  (10.7 vs. 23.0%; p=0.006), w. confusa (10.0 vs. 22.4%; p=0.037), leuconostoc citreum (6.5 vs. 14.8%; p=0.009), streptococcus equinus (0.14 vs. 1.0%; p=0.044), and s. lutetiensis (0.01 vs. 0.11%; p=0.016) increased in relative abundance. nonlactic acid bacteria that were influenced by increased dietary zno included the strict anaerobic species, sarcina ventriculi, which showed a strong numerical decrease in relative abundance (14.6 vs. 5.1%). species of the enterobacteriaceae increased their relative abundance, as well as species diversity, in the high dietary zno experimental group. bacterial diversity indices were increased due to increased dietary zno (p < 0.05), which was traced back to the increase of sequences from subdominant species. increased dietary zno led to an increase of less prominent species and, thus, had a major impact on the bacterial composition and diversity in piglets. this effect may help to stabilize the intestinal microbiota in the sensitive postweaning period.

TI  == co-aggregation and growth inhibition of probiotic lactobacilli and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. the aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. materials and methods: mutans streptococci (ms) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. one laboratory reference strain (s. mutans ingbritt) was selected as control. co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. results: all probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated ms strains. statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from  different individuals when compared with the reference strain. the selected lactobacilli inhibited ms growth, but the ability varied between the strains and  was clearly related to ph. no differences were observed between the different ms  strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. conclusions: the selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. the growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on ph and cell concentration. the findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend  on the specific strain used.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == probiotic lactobacilli interfere with streptococcus mutans biofilm formation in vitro.
AB  == in clinical studies, probiotic bacteria have decreased the counts of salivary mutans streptococci (ms). we compared the effects of probiotic lactobacillus strains on the biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans. the bacterial strains used included four s. mutans strains (reference strains nctc 10449 and ingbritt and clinical isolates 2366 and 195) and probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum 299v, and l. reuteri strains pta 5289 and sd2112. the ability of ms to adhere and grow on a glass surface, reflecting biofilm formation, was studied in the presence of the lactobacilli (lb). the effect of lb culture supernatants on the viability of the ms was studied as well. all of the lb inhibited the biofilm formation of the clinical isolates of ms (p < 0.001). the biofilm formation of the reference strains of ms was also inhibited by the lb, but l. plantarum and l. reuteri pta 5289 showed a weaker inhibition when compared to l. reuteri sd2112 and l. rhamnosus gg. viable s. mutans cells could be detected in the biofilms and culture media only when the experiments were performed with the l. reuteri strains. the l. reuteri strains were less efficient in killing the ms also in the tests performed with the culture supernatants. the  phs of the supernatants of l. reuteri were higher compared to those of l. rhamnosus gg and l. plantarum; p < 0.001. in conclusion, our results demonstrated that four commonly used probiotics interfered with s. mutans biofilm formation in vitro, and that the antimicrobial activity against s. mutans was ph-dependent.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and c. albicans in vitro. methods: eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of candida albicans with an agar overlay method. results: at concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 cfu/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci  completely with the exception of l. acidophilus la5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 cfu/ml. at the lowest cell concentration (103 cfu/ml), only l. plantarum 299v and l. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by l. rhamnosus lb21, l. paracasei  f19, l. reuteri pta 5289 and l. reuteri atcc 55730. all the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. the two l. plantarum strains and l. reuteri atcc 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on candida albicans. no significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. conclusion: the selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and candida albicans in vitro.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria from indonesia reveals glucansucrase and fructansucrase genes in two different weissella confusa strains from soya.
AB  == homopolysaccharide (glucan and fructan) synthesis from sucrose by sucrase enzymes in lactic acid bacteria (lab) has been well studied in the genera leuconostoc, streptococcus and lactobacillus. this study aimed to identify and characterize genes encoding glucansucrase/glucosyltransferase (gtf) and fructansucrases/fructosyltransferase (ftf) enzymes from genomic dna of 'rare' indonesian exopolysaccharide-producing lab. from a total of 63 exopolysaccharide-producing lab isolates obtained from foods, beverages and environmental samples, 18 isolates showing the most slimy and mucoid colony morphologies on sucrose were chosen for further study. by comparing bacterial growth on de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs)-sucrose with that on mrs-raffinose, and using the results of a previous pcr screening study with degenerate primer pairs  targeting the conserved catalytic domain of gtfs, various strains were identified as producers of fructan (13), of glucan only (five) or as potential producers of  both glucan and fructan (nine). here, we report the characteristics of three gtf  genes and one ftf gene obtained from weissella confusa strains mbf8-1 and mbf8-2. strain mbf8-1 harbored two putative gtf genes with high sequence similarity to gtfb of lactobacillus reuteri 121 and gtf180 of l. reuteri 180, respectively. strain mbf8-2 possessed single gtf and ftf genes with high sequence similarity to gtfkg3 of lactobacillus fermentum kg3 and dsrwc of weissella cibaria, and ftf levansucrase of l. reuteri 121, respectively.

TI  == enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI  == coaggregation between probiotic bacteria and caries-associated strains: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro abilities of probiotic bacteria derived from  consumer products to coaggregate with caries-associated mutans streptococci. material and methods: six lactobacillus strains (l. acidophilus (ccug 5917), l. plantarum 299v, l. rhamnosus gg and lb21, l. paracasei f19, l. reuteri pta5289) were cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c in man rogosa sharpe (msb) broth for 24 h. four strains of human streptococci (s. mutans ingbritt, s.  mutans (atcc 25175), s. mutans gs-5, s. sobrinus (atcc 33478) were similarly grown in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth. a gastrointestinal pathogen (escherichia coli) was aerobically cultivated on bhi broth as a positive control. after incubation, the bacteria were aerobically harvested, washed, and suspended  in 10 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.2). the probiotic strains were characterized with the api 50 ch system to confirm their identity. coaggregation  was determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures and bacterial suspensions alone after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h and expressed as the aggregation ratio (%). results: all  probiotic strains showed coaggregation abilities with the oral pathogens and the  results were strain specific and dependent on time. s. mutans gs-5 exhibited a significantly higher ability to coaggregate with all the probiotic strains than the other mutans streptococci and e. coli. the differences among the probiotic strains were modest with l. acidophilus being the most prone and l. rhamnosus lb21 the least prone to coaggregate with the oral streptococci. conclusions: the  results demonstrated different abilities of lactobacilli-derived probiotic bacteria to coaggregate with selected oral streptococci. aggregation assays may be a useful complement for screening of probiotic candidates with possible anti-caries properties.

TI  == change of intestinal microbiota with elemental diet and its impact on therapeutic effects in a murine model of chronic colitis.
AB  == elemental diet (ed) has been used as an enteral nutritional therapy for crohn's disease. however, the precise mechanisms of ed remain unclear. in interleukin-10  (il-10)-deficient cell-transferred mice, we investigated the change of intestinal microbiota with ed using molecular terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis and culture method, and evaluated its influence on therapeutic effects of ed. ed significantly suppressed intestinal inflammation. the total amount of bacteria in colitis mice fed the regular diet was higher than in normal mice but decreased in colitis mice fed ed. t-rflp profiles of the ed group markedly differed from those of the regular diet groups. the diversity of bacterial species in the ed group decreased to 60% of that found in the regular diet groups. among the cultivated bacteria, the change in lactic acid bacteria composition was remarkable. lactobacillus reuteri and l. johnsonii decreased and  enterococcus faecalis and e. durans increased in the ed group. the culture supernatant of l. reuteri isolates induced significant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and il-6 activity in raw 264 cells, while the culture supernatant of e. faecalis and e. durans barely induced their activity. these data suggested that reduction in amount and diversity of intestinal microbiota and decrease of proinflammatory cytokines via a change in composition of lactic acid bacteria by ed seem to contribute to reduction of bowel inflammation in this model.

TI  == probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB  == probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (fao/who joint group). their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., bacillus clausii, lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri rc-14, gg, and l. plantarum 299v), bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), saccharomyces boulardii etc. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. these are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. critical illness and its  treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. however, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, icu stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost  effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. more information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. at present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.

TI  == probiotics for children with diarrhea: an update.
AB  == this review focuses on the efficacy of probiotics for diarrhea in children in different settings: day-care centers, diarrhea acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 5 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus), and lactobacillus reuteri. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest: statistically significant for some strains only and in any case of minimal to mild clinical importance. few trials have examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spread of diarrhea in hospitalized children, an event most commonly due to either rotavirus or clostridium difficile, and they have yielded conflicting results. overall, these studies provide only weak evidence on the efficacy of probiotics. on the other hand, a large number of trials on the role of probiotics in preventing the  onset of antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been published. most commonly employed probiotics were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium spp., streptococcus spp., and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. today, we have a large number of published clinical trials on the role of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea in children, and many of them are randomized, blinded, and controlled. they consistently show  a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii, but also l. reuteri-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, primarily rotaviral, in infants and young children of developed countries. such a beneficial effect seems to result in a reduction of diarrhea duration of little more than 1 day, and to be exerted mostly on diarrhea due to rotavirus. the effect is not only strain-dependent, but also dose-dependent, with doses of at least 10 billion/d being necessary.

TI  == yogurt containing probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 helps resolve moderate diarrhea and increases cd4 count in hiv/aids patients.
AB  == hiv/aids is changing the human landscape in sub-saharan africa. relatively few patients receive antiretroviral therapy, and many suffer from debilitating diarrhea that affects their quality of life. given the track record of probiotics to alleviate diarrhea, conventional yogurt fermented with lactobacillus delbruekii var bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus was supplemented with probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14. twenty-four hiv/aids adult female patients (18 to 44 y) with clinical signs of moderate diarrhea, cd4  counts over 200, and not receiving antiretrovirals or dietary supplements, consumed either 100 ml supplemented or unsupplemented yogurt per day for 15 days. hematologic profiles, cd4 cell counts, and quality of life was evaluated at baseline, 15 and 30 days postprobiotic-yogurt feeding. there was no significant alteration in the hematologic parameters of both groups before and after the probiotic-yogurt feeding. the probiotic yogurt group at baseline, 15 and 30 days  had a mean wbc count of 5.8+/-0.76 x 10(9)/l, 6.0+/-1.02 x 10(9)/l, and 5.4+/-0.14 x 10(9)/l, respectively. however, the mean cd4 cell count remained the same or increased at 15 and 30 days in 11/12 probiotic-treated subjects compared  to 3/12 in the control. diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea resolved in 12/12 probiotic-treated subjects within 2 days, compared to 2/12 receiving yogurt for 15 days. this is the first study to show the benefits of probiotic yogurt on quality of life of women in nigeria with hiv/aids, and suggests that perhaps a simple fermented food can provide some relief in the management of the aids epidemic in africa.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria from poultry feces: evidence on anti-campylobacter and anti-listeria activities.
AB  == forty-five strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from poultry feces sampled from an industrial farm located in the nantes area (france), and most of  them belong to the streptococcus or lactobacillus genus according to the results  obtained by galerie api and molecular methods. the most representative lactic acid bacteria strains were screened for antibacterial compound production against 2 indicator organisms (listeria innocua f and campylobacter jejuni 11168) by means of the agar diffusion test. strain s37, identified as enterococcus faecalis, exhibited a clear anti-listerial activity and a slight anti-campylobacter activity, whereas strain s42, identified as lactobacillus reuteri, exhibited only anti-campylobacter activity. regarding the results of proteolytic, heat, and neutralizing treatments of supernatants from the aforementioned strains, we can conclude that antagonism observed is attributed to antimicrobial peptide or bacteriocin in the case of strain s37, whereas it is ascribable to a nonbacteriocin, likely a reuterin, in the case of strain s42.

TI  == genetic features of circular bacteriocins produced by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == this review highlights the main genetic features of circular bacteriocins, which  require the co-ordinated expression of several genetic determinants. in general terms, it has been demonstrated that the expression of such structural genes must be combined with the activity of proteins involved in maturation (cleavage/circularization) and secretion outside the cell via different transporter systems, as well as multifaceted immunity mechanisms essential to ensuring the bacteria's self-protection against such strong inhibitors. several circular antibacterial peptides produced by gram-positive bacteria have been described to date, including enterocin as-48, from enterococcus faecalis s-48 (the first one characterized), gassericin a, from lactobacillus gasseri la39, and a similar one, reutericin 6, from lactobacillus reuteri la6, butyrivibriocin ar10, from the ruminal anaerobe butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ar10, uberolysin, from  streptococcus uberis, circularin a, from clostridium beijerinckii atcc 25752, and subtilosin a, from bacillus subtilis. we summarize here the progress made in the  understanding of their principal genetic features over the last few years, during which the functional roles of circular proteins with wide biological activity have become clearer.

AB  == objective: previous studies have suggested that lactobacilli-derived probiotics in dairy products may affect oral ecology, but the impact of different vehicles of ingestion has received little attention. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730 on the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in young adults when ingested by two different delivery systems. material and methods: the material comprised 120 healthy young adults (21-24 years) and a placebo-controlled study design with parallel arms was utilized. the subjects were randomly assigned to four equally sized groups: group a drank 200 ml of water through a prepared straw containing l. reuteri atcc 55730 once daily for 3  weeks, while group b took 200 ml water through a placebo straw during the same period. group c was given one tablet containing l. reuteri atcc 55730 once daily  for 3 weeks, while group d received placebo tablets without bacteria. salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were enumerated with chair-side kits at baseline and 1 day after the final ingestion. results: a statistically significant reduction of the mutans streptococci levels was recorded after ingestion of the probiotic bacteria via the straw (p<0.05) and the tablets (p<0.01), which was in contrast to the placebo controls. a similar but non-significant trend was seen for lactobacilli. conclusions: a short-term daily  ingestion of lactobacilli-derived probiotics delivered by prepared straws or lozenges reduced the levels of salivary mutans streptococci in young adults.

TI  == short-chain fatty acid formation in the hindgut of rats fed native and fermented  oat fibre concentrates.
AB  == the formation of scfa in rats fed fermented oat fibre concentrates was compared with that of rats fed native oat fibre concentrate. the cultures used were lactic acid bacteria consisting of lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus (v2), the exopolysaccharide-producing strain pediococcus damnosus 2.6 (pd) and l. reuteri (lr). the materials were incorporated into test diets yielding a concentration of indigestible carbohydrates of 80 g/kg (dry weight). rats fed the v2-fermented fibre-concentrate diet yielded higher caecal and distal concentrations of acetic acid (p < 0.01) than rats fed the native fibre concentrate. all the fermented fibre concentrates resulted in a higher propionic  acid concentration in the distal colon (p < 0.05), while rats fed pd-fermented fibre concentrate resulted in lower concentration of butyric acid (p < 0.05, p <  0.01) in all parts of the hindgut as compared with rats fed the native fibre concentrates. butyrate concentrations ranged between 5-11 micromol/g (distal colon) and 6-8 micromol/g (13 d faeces). higher proportions of acetic acid (p < 0.05; p < 0.01) were observed in the caecum of rats fed the fermented fibre concentrates. rats fed pd- and lr-fermented fibre concentrates produced higher proportions of propionic acid (p < 0.05; p < 0.01) in the caecum. changes in scfa formation in the caecum, distal colon and faeces of rats fed the fermented samples compared with the native sample indicate that these microbes probably survive in the hindgut and that modification of the microflora composition with fermented foods is possible. this may be important for the gastrointestinal flora balance in relation to colonic diseases.

TI  == use of probiotics in children with acute diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics, defined as microbial cell preparations or components of microbial cells that have a beneficial effect on the health and well being of the host, have traditionally been used to treat and prevent a variety of infections. beneficial effects of probiotics in acute infectious diarrhea in children seem to be: (i) moderate; (ii) strain-dependent; (iii) dose dependent; (iv) significant in watery diarrhea and viral gastroenteritis, but non-existent in invasive, bacterial diarrhea; and (v) more evident when treatment with probiotics is initiated early in the course of disease. three large, randomized controlled trials (rcts) provide evidence of a very modest effect (statistically significant, but of questionable clinical importance) of some probiotic strains (lactobaccillus gg, lactobaccillus reuteri, bifodobacterium lactis) on the prevention of community-acquired diarrhea. we have found conflicting evidence from four rcts on the efficacy of lactobacillus gg and b. bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus in the prevention of nosocomial diarrhea in children.  two rcts in children provide evidence of a moderate beneficial effect of lactobacillus gg in the prevention of antibacterial-associated diarrhea (aad), but results in adults are conflicting. data on the efficacy of other probiotic strains in aad in children are very limited. in conclusion, to date, the most extensively studied and best documented clinical application of probiotics in children is for the treatment of acute watery diarrhea of rotaviral or presumably viral etiology. studies documenting effects in other types of diarrheal diseases  in children are limited, although some preliminary results are promising. the effects of different probiotic microorganisms are not equal. only very few probiotic strains have been tested rigorously in rcts. many questions remain to be answered. future clinical trials should evaluate carefully selected, precisely defined probiotic strains and address clinically important endpoints.

TI  == influence of dietary zinc oxide and copper sulfate on the gastrointestinal ecosystem in newly weaned piglets.
AB  == dietary doses of 2,500 ppm zno-zn reduced bacterial activity (atp accumulation) in digesta from the gastrointestinal tracts of newly weaned piglets compared to that in animals receiving 100 ppm zno-zn. the amounts of lactic acid bacteria (mrs counts) and lactobacilli (rogosa counts) were reduced, whereas coliforms (macconkey counts) and enterococci (slanetz counts, red colonies) were more numerous in animals receiving the high zno dose. based on 16s rrna gene sequencing, the colonies on mrs were dominated by three phylotypes, tentatively identified as lactobacillus amylovorus (otu171), lactobacillus reuteri (otu173),  and streptococcus alactolyticus (otu180). the colonies on rogosa plates were dominated by the two lactobacillus phylotypes only. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis supported the observations of three phylotypes of lactic acid bacteria dominating in piglets receiving the low zno dose and of coliforms and enterococci dominating in piglets receiving the high zno dose. dietary doses of 175 ppm cuso(4)-cu also reduced mrs and rogosa counts of stomach contents, but for these animals, the numbers of coliforms were reduced in the cecum and the colon. the influence of zno on the gastrointestinal microbiota resembles the working mechanism suggested for some growth-promoting antibiotics,  namely, the suppression of gram-positive commensals rather than potentially pathogenic gram-negative organisms. reduced fermentation of digestible nutrients  in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract may render more energy available for the host animal and contribute to the growth-promoting effect of high dietary zno doses. dietary cuso(4) inhibited the coliforms and thus potential pathogens as well, but overall the observed effect of cuso(4) was limited compared to that of zno.

TI  == glucan synthesis in the genus lactobacillus: isolation and characterization of glucansucrase genes, enzymes and glucan products from six different strains.
AB  == members of the genera streptococcus and leuconostoc synthesize various alpha-glucans (dextran, alternan and mutan). in lactobacillus, until now, the only glucosyltransferase (gtf) enzyme that has been characterized is gtfa of lactobacillus reuteri 121, the first gtf enzyme synthesizing a glucan (reuteran)  that contains mainly alpha-(1-->4) linkages together with alpha-(1-->6) and alpha-(1-->4,6) linkages. recently, partial sequences of glucansucrase genes were detected in other members of the genus lactobacillus. this paper reports, for the first time, isolation and characterization of dextransucrase and mutansucrase genes and enzymes from various lactobacillus species and the characterization of  the glucan products synthesized, which mainly have alpha-(1-->6)- and alpha-(1-->3)-glucosidic linkages. the four gtf enzymes characterized from three  different lb. reuteri strains are highly similar at the amino acid level, and consequently their protein structures are very alike. interestingly, these four lb. reuteri gtfs have relatively large n-terminal variable regions, containing rdv repeats, and relatively short putative glucan-binding domains with conserved  and less-conserved yg-repeating units. the three other gtf enzymes, isolated from lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus parabuchneri, contain smaller variable regions and larger putative glucan-binding domains compared to the lb. reuteri gtf enzymes.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == biochemical and molecular characterization of lactobacillus reuteri 121 reuteransucrase.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 uses sucrose for synthesis of a unique, soluble  glucan ('reuteran') with mainly alpha-(1-->4) glucosidic linkages. the gene (gtfa) encoding this glucansucrase enzyme had previously been characterized. here, a detailed biochemical and molecular analysis of the gtfa enzyme is presented. this is believed to be the first report describing reuteransucrase enzyme kinetics and the oligosaccharides synthesized with various acceptors. alignments of the gtfa sequence with glucansucrases from streptococcus and leuconostoc identified conserved amino-acid residues in the catalytic core critical for enzyme activity. mutants asp1024asn, glu1061gln and asp1133asn displayed 300- to 1000-fold-reduced specific activities. to investigate the role  of the relatively large n-terminal variable domain (702 amino acids) and the relatively short c-terminal putative glucan-binding domain (267 amino acids, with 11 yg repeats), various truncated derivatives of gtfa (1781 amino acids) were constructed and characterized. deletion of the complete n-terminal variable domain of gtfa (gtfa-delta n) had little effect on reuteran characteristics (size, distribution of glycosidic linkages), but the initial transferase activity of the mutant enzyme increased drastically. sequential c-terminal deletions (up to six yg repeats) in gtfa-delta n also had little effect on reuteran characteristics. however, enzyme kinetics drastically changed. deletion of 7, 8 or 11 yg repeats resulted in dramatic loss of total enzyme activity (43-, 63- and 1000-fold-reduced specific activities, respectively). characterization of sequential c-terminal deletion mutants of gtfa-delta n revealed that the c-terminal domain of reuteransucrase has an important role in glucan binding.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == biochemical and molecular characterization of a levansucrase from lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 employs a fructosyltransferase (ftf) to synthesize a fructose polymer [a fructan of the levan type, with beta(2-->6) linkages] from sucrose or raffinose. purification of this ftf (a levansucrase), and identification of peptide amino acid sequences, allowed isolation of the first lactobacillus levansucrase gene (lev), encoding a protein (lev) consisting  of 804 amino acids. lev showed highest similarity with an inulosucrase of l. reuteri 121 [inu; producing an inulin polymer with beta(2-->1)-linked fructosyl units] and with ftfs from streptococci. expression of lev in escherichia coli resulted in an active ftf (lev delta 773his) that produced the same levan polymer [with only 2-3 % beta(2-->1-->6) branching points] as l. reuteri 121 cells grown  on raffinose. the low degree of branching of the l. reuteri levan is very different from bacterial levans known up to now, such as that of streptococcus salivarius, having up to 30 % branches. although lev is unusual in showing a higher hydrolysis than transferase activity, significant amounts of levan polymer are produced both in vivo and in vitro. lev is strongly dependent on ca(2+) ions  for activity. unique properties of l. reuteri lev together with inu are: (i) the  presence of a c-terminal cell-wall-anchoring motif causing similar expression problems in escherichia coli, (ii) a relatively high optimum temperature for activity for ftf enzymes, and (iii) at 50 degrees c, kinetics that are best described by the hill equation.

TI  == heat shock treatment increases the frequency of loss of an erythromycin resistance-encoding transposable element from the chromosome of lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692.
AB  == a 3,165-bp chromosomally integrated transposon, designatedtn3692, of the gram-positive strain lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692 contains an erm(b) gene conferring resistance to erythromycin at concentrations of up to 250 micrograms/ml. loss of this resistance can occur spontaneously, but the rate is substantially increased by heat shock treatment. heat shock treatment at 60 degrees c resulted in an almost 40-fold increase in the frequency of erythromycin-sensitive cells (erythromycin mic, 0.047 micrograms/ml). the phenotypic change was followed by a dramatic increase in transcription of the transposase gene and the concomitant loss of an approximately 2-kb dna fragment carrying the erm(b) gene from the 3,165-bp erm transposon. in cells that were not subjected to heat shock, transcription of the transposase gene was not detectable. the upstream sequence of the transposase gene did not show any homology to known heat shock promoters in the gene data bank. significant homology (>99%) was observed between the erythromycin resistance-encoding gene from l. crispatus chcc3692 and the erm(b) genes from other gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus  faecium, and lactobacillus reuteri, which strongly indicates a common origin of the erm(b) gene for these species. the transposed dna element was not translocated to other parts of the genome of chcc3692, as determining by southern blotting, pcr analysis, and dna sequencing. no other major aberrations were observed, as judged by colony morphology, growth performance of the strain, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. these observations suggest that heat shock treatment could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted antibiotic resistance genes harbored in transposons flanked by insertion sequence elements or transposases in lactic acid bacteria used for animal and human food production.

TI  == peptide surface display and secretion using two lpxtg-containing surface proteins from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == a locus encoding two repetitive proteins that have lpxtg cell wall anchoring signals from lactobacillus fermentum br11 has been identified by using an antiserum raised against whole l. fermentum br11 cells. the first protein, rlp, is similar to the rib surface protein from streptococcus agalactiae, while the other protein, mlp, is similar to the mucus binding protein mub from lactobacillus reuteri. it was shown that multiple copies of mlp exist in the genome of l. fermentum br11. regions of rlp, mlp, and the previously characterized surface protein bspa were used to surface display or secrete heterologous peptides in l. fermentum. the peptides tested were 10 amino acids of the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein and a six-histidine epitope (his(6)). the bspa promoter and secretion signal were used in combination with the rlp cell wall sorting signal to express, export, and covalently anchor the heterologous peptides to the cell wall. detection of the cell surface protein fusions revealed that rlp was a significantly better surface display vector than  bspa despite having lower cellular levels (0.7 mg per liter for the rlp fusion compared with 4 mg per liter for the bspa fusion). the mlp promoter and encoded secretion signal were used to express and export large (328-kda at 10 mg per liter) and small (27-kda at 0.06 mg per liter) amino-terminal fragments of the mlp protein fused to the his(6) and cftr peptides or his(6) peptide, respectively. therefore, these newly described proteins from l. fermentum br11 have potential as protein production and targeting vectors.

TI  == high prevalence of inducible erythromycin resistance among streptococcus bovis isolates in taiwan.
AB  == susceptibilities to 13 antimicrobial agents were determined by measurement of mics for 60 isolates of streptococcus bovis from blood cultures. thirty-eight isolates (63.3%) had high-level resistance to erythromycin (mics, >or=128 microg/ml). among the 38 erythromycin-resistant strains, 21 isolates (55%) had inducible resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (imls isolates) and 17 (45%) had constitutive resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (cmls isolates). tetracycline resistance was also found among all of the erythromycin-resistant strains. none of the strains displayed resistance to penicillin, chloramphenicol, or vancomycin. detection of erythromycin resistance  genes by pcr and sequencing indicated that all 17 cmls isolates were positive for the ermb gene and that 7 of 21 imls isolates carried the ermb gene and the remaining 14 imls isolates carried the ermt gene. sequence analysis of amplified  partial ermb fragments (594 bp) from s. bovis isolates revealed a 99.8% nucleotide identity and a 100% amino acid homology compared with the sequences from gene banks. the sequences of amplified fragments with primers targeted for ermc were shown to be very similar to that of ermgt (ermt) from lactobacillus reuteri (98.5% nucleotide identity). this is the first report to describe the detection of the ermt class of erythromycin resistance determinants in s. bovis.  the high rate of inducible erythromycin resistance among s. bovis isolates in taiwan was not reported before. the imls s. bovis isolates were shown to be heterogeneous by randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis. these results indicate that the prevalence of inducible erythromycin resistance in s. bovis in  taiwan is very high and that most of the resistant strains carry the ermt or the  ermb gene.

AB  == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and  streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined  in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the  results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and  no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

AB  == increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. however, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. the specific objectives of this study were to  evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice  on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. mice were  gavaged with 1 x 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, peyer's patch and splenic  leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. these were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (il)-6, il-12, interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. the results revealed that lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei potentiated il-6 and il-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas l. acidophilus  upregulated ifn-gamma and nitric oxide. in contrast, l. helveticus, l. gasseri, l. reuteri, and bifidobacterium attenuated the production of il-6, ifn-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. tnf-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. none of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric  oxide by peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.

AB  == study of antagonistic properties of microaerophilic bacteria isolated from human  and mink gastroenteric tract have helped to establish differences in species composition, quantity and level of antagonistic activity of the studied microorganisms in respect to pathogenic microflora. it is shown that lactic acid  bacteria identified as lactobacillus fermentum and l. reuteri prevail among the strains isolated from the stomach and thin intestine of minks kept in the 30-km zone of chernobyl npp. species composition of microaerophilic bacteria isolated from the digestive tract of the control minks is more variable. antagonistically  active bifidobacteria prevail in large intestine of experimental and control animals. strains of lactic acid bacteria with the expressed antagonistic activity belonging to l. bavaricus, l. reuteri, l. coryniformis and l. maltaromicus have been found parallel with such known producers of antibiotic-like substances as l. fermentum. l. acidophilum. streptococcus faecalis and bifidobacteria. l. maltaromicus most frequently occurred among antagonistically active strains revealed in feces of people which stayed in the zone of liquidation of the chernobyl accident. microaerophilic strains of bacteria (lactic acid, bifidobacteria and enterococci) manifest the expressed antagonistic activity connected with the capacity to not only acid formation but also to accumulation of antibiotic products of unknown nature. a strain of lactic acid bacteria l. fermentum 91 has been isolated from the contents of human gastroenteric tract. these bacteria are distinguished by most expressed and stable antagonism and characterized by the lack of pathogenicity in respect of albino mice that may be  used to raise the microorganism resistance to gastric diseases.

TI  == development of rapd protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  == a protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) fragments has been developed. using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic dna. different conditions of dna release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. this rapd protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. helveticus, lact. casei, lact. reuteri, lact. plantarum, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium  and streptococcus thermophilus.

TI  == development of intestinal lactobacilli in normal piglets.
AB  == the development of intestinal lactobacillus spp. in 18 normal piglets from six litters was investigated from 1 to 45 d after birth. faecal lactobacillus strains isolated from piglets and their dams were identified at species and biovar levels on the basis of carbohydrate fermentation. a definite pattern was observed in the changes of four species and 20 biovars of lactobacilli appearing in faeces, with  growth of the piglets. lactobacillus reuteri colonized the animals on the first day of birth. the lact. acidophilus group appeared 1 week after birth and maintained high levels in the intestine. biovars b, c and e of lact. reuteri were recovered as major biovars on the first to fourteenth days after birth. in the third and fourth weeks after birth, however, biovars f and g of lact. reuteri were mainly recovered from piglet faeces. by the seventh week, biovars b, c and e predominated again in the intestine. no change in the composition of species and  biovars of the genus lactobacillus in the dams was detected.

TI  == the formation of biogenic amines by fermentation organisms.
AB  == a total of 523 strains representing 35 species related to food fermentation organisms of practical importance were investigated for their potential for formation of biogenic amines (ba). the investigation was performed with resting cells in phosphate buffer (ph 5.5) and the formation of the following bas was followed: putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine and 2-phenylethylamine. no  potential was observed in species of lactococcus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, streptococcus and several lactobacillus spp., such as l. pentosus and l. sake. a  remarkable potential to form ba was observed in strains of carnobacteria, lactobacillus buchneri, l. curvatus, l. reuteri, staphylococcus carnosus and, to  a lesser extent, in l. alimentarius, l. brevis, l. bavaricus, l. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, micrococcus spp. and s. piscifermentans. in well known species with a practical function in the fermentation of dairy products, wine or cabbage a potential was observed for few strains only. in view of their role as starters in food fermentation, or their potential use in protective cultures and as probiotics, ba formation by the organisms has to be taken into consideration by selecting appropriate strains.

TI  == molecular characterization of a plasmid-borne (pgt633) erythromycin resistance determinant (ermgt) from lactobacillus reuteri 100-63.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri 100-63 contains a 9.8 kb plasmid (pgt633) encoding resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (mls) type b antibiotics. the restriction endonucleases acci, bamhi, bcli, ecori, ecorv, hhai, hindii, hpai, kpni, sali, and sspi were employed to establish a physical map of pgt633. next, genetic transfer experiments were conducted to establish the host range of  pgt633. the results revealed that pgt633 replicated autonomously and encoded constitutive resistance to erythromycin in a variety of bacterial hosts, including bacillus subtilis bd170, streptococcus sanguis dl1, staphylococcus aureus rn4220, and enterococcus faecalis 19433, as well as several lactobacillus  spp. a 2.2 kb bamhi fragment of pgt633 containing the genetic determinant (ermgt) encoding resistance to erythromycin was cloned into escherichia coli. determination of the nucleotide sequence of ermgt revealed a methylase gene 731 bp in length that was highly related (ca. 81% nucleotide and ca. 78% amino acid identity) to the ermc gene from s. aureus plasmid pe194. the leader sequences of  ermgt and ermc were identical except for a single base change at nt 51.

TI  == identification and cloning of a plasmid-encoded erythromycin resistance determinant from lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == plasmid analysis, plasmid curing, cloning, and hybridization experiments were used to study four lactobacillus reuteri strains showing high resistance to erythromycin. plasmid curing with acriflavine resulted in a loss of erythromycin  resistance in a frequency of 1-10%. for three of the strains this was accompanied by a loss of a 6.9-mda plasmid, which was shown to be identical for the different strains and designated plul631. the erythromycin (erm) gene was located on a 5.5-mda plasmid in the fourth strain. a restriction map of plul631 was constructed and the location of the erm gene on the plasmid was identified by cloning in escherichia coli. by using a streptococcus lactis-e. coli shuttle vector, the erm gene was also transformed to s. lactis and expressed. the erm gene from l. reuteri was shown to be related to the erm gene from pip501 (streptococcus agalactiae) by dna-dna hybridization.

TI  == the effect of yoghurt on some components of the gut microflora and on the metabolism of lactose in the rat.
AB  == feeding yoghurt or base milk (from which the yoghurt was prepared by fermentation) to rats increased the counts of coliforms in the gut whereas the counts of lactobacilli were reduced by yoghurt but not by the base milk. lactobacillus bulgaricus survived in the guts of gnotobiotic and conventional rats when yoghurt was fed continuously. streptococcus thermophilus also survived  in gnotobiotic rats but its ability to survive in conventional rats could not be  examined. both organisms failed to colonise the gut when a small inoculum of yoghurt was administered orally to germfree rats maintained on the stock diet. streptococcus thermophilus but not lact. bulgaricus grew in the rat diet when tested in vitro. two enzyme systems (beta-galactosidase and lactase) were studied using, respectively, o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (onpg) and lactose as the test substrates. enzyme levels estimated with both substrates increased in the gut contents when rats were fed yoghurt but an increase was only found with onpg in the intestinal mucosa fraction. the bacterial origin of all this increased activity is discussed. the other lactose-containing diets did not affect enzyme activity to the same degree. feeding yoghurt changed the lactobacillus flora from one which was predominantly heterofermentative (lact. reuteri ) to one which was predominantly homofermentative (lact. salivarius).
