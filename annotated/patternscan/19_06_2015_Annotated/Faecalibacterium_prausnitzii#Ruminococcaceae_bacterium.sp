TI  == association of dietary type with fecal microbiota in vegetarians and omnivores in slovenia.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to discover differences in the human fecal microbiota composition driven by long-term omnivore versus vegan/lacto-vegetarian dietary pattern. in addition, the possible association of demographic characteristics and dietary habits such as consumption of particular foods with the fecal microbiota was examined. methods: this study was conducted on a slovenian population comprising 31 vegetarian participants (11 lacto-vegetarians  and 20 vegans) and 29 omnivore participants. bacterial dna was extracted from the frozen fecal samples by maxwell 16 tissue dna purification kit (promega). relative quantification of selected bacterial groups was performed by real-time pcr. differences in fecal microbiota composition were evaluated by pcr-dgge fingerprinting of the v3 16s rrna region. participants' demographic characteristics, dietary habits and health status information were collected through a questionnaire. results: vegetarian diet was associated with higher ratio (% of group-specific dna in relation to all bacterial dna) of bacteroides-prevotella, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium clostridioforme and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, but with lower ratio (%) of clostridium cluster xiva. real-time pcr also showed a higher concentration and ratio of enterobacteriaceae (16s rdna copies/g and %) in female participants (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) and decrease in bifidobacterium with age (p < 0.01). dgge analysis of the 16s rrna v3 region showed that relative quantity of dgge bands from certain bacterial groups was lower (bifidobacterium, streptococus, collinsella and lachnospiraceae) or higher (subdoligranulum) among vegetarians, indicating the association of dietary type with bacterial community composition. sequencing of selected dgge bands revealed the presence of common representatives of fecal microbiota: bacteroides, eubacterium, faecalibacterium, ruminococcaceae, bifidobacterium and lachnospiraceae. up to 4 % of variance in microbial community analyzed by dgge could be explained by the vegetarian type of diet. conclusions:  long-term vegetarian diet contributed to quantity and associated bacterial community shifts in fecal microbiota composition. consumption of foods of animal  origin (eggs, red meat, white meat, milk, yoghurt, other dairy products, fish and seafood) and vegetarian type of diet explained the largest share of variance in microbial community structure. fecal microbiota composition was also associated with participants' age, gender and body mass.

TI  == prebiotic stimulation of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria and bifidobacteria, in vitro.
AB  == dietary macronutrients affect the composition of the gut microbiota, and prebiotics are used to improve and maintain a healthy gut. the impact of prebiotics on dominant gut bacteria other than bifidobacteria, however, is under-researched. here, we report carbohydrate utilisation patterns for representative butyrate-producing anaerobes, belonging to the gram-positive firmicutes families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, by comparison with selected bacteroides and bifidobacterium species. growth assessments using anaerobic hungate tubes and a new rapid microtitre plate assay were generally in  good agreement. the bacteroides strains tested showed some growth on basal medium with no added carbohydrates, utilising peptides in the growth medium. the butyrate-producing strains exhibited different growth profiles on the substrates, which included starch, inulin, fructooligosaccharides (fos), galactooligosaccharides (gos) and xylooligosaccharides (xos). eleven were able to grow on short-chain fos, but this number decreased as the chain length of the fructan substrates increased. long-chain inulin was utilised by roseburia inulinivorans, but by none of the bifidobacterium species examined here. xos was  a more selective growth substrate than fos, with only six of the 11 firmicutes strains able to use xos for growth. these results illustrate the selectivity of different prebiotics and help to explain why some are butyrogenic.

TI  == [specificity comparison of three feacalibacterium prausnitzii-specific pcr primer pairs].
AB  == objective: to compare the specificity of three 16s rrna gene-based pcr primer pairs (fpr-1/fpr-2, fpr-2f/fprau645r and fprau223f/fprau420r), which are used to  specifically detect and quantify the important human gut bacterium feacalibacterium prausnitzii. methods: clustal x was used to align the sequences  of individual primer and the 16s rrna gene of f. prausnitzii and other bacteria.  the number of faecalibacterium spp. sequences in ribosomal database project (rdp) matched by each primer was obtained by the probe match tool. with the full-length 16s rrna gene clone library constructed by our laboratory which contained 7255 clones from the gut microbiota of 7 chinese people, the simulated pcr (spcr) program was applied to predict the clone number of f. prausnitzii and other gut bacteria matched by every primer pair; pcr amplification was performed with three primer pairs and representative clones to verify the spcr prediction. real-time quantitative pcr was performed with three primer pairs, respectively, for fecal samples from 14 healthy individuals. results: the first base at the 3' end of fprau645r showed the highest mismatch level for non-f. prausnitzii bacteria. the  percentage of the number of faecalibacterium spp. sequences matched by fprau645r  accounting for that of matched bacteria sequences in the rdp database was 97.6%,  which was significantly higher than that of other primers. as spcr predicted, all three primer pairs can detect about 1171 clones from f. prausnitzii; the clones of non-faecalibacterium spp. detected by fpr-2f/fprau645r mainly were subdoligranulum spp. , but the non-faecalibacterium spp. clones detected by fpr-1/fpr-2 and fprau223f/fprau420r were mainly subdoligranulum spp., oscillibacter spp. , ruminococcus spp. and unclassified ruminococcaceae etc. the  real pcr showed the same results with spcr. the real-time quantitative pcr showed fpr-1/fpr-2 and fprau223f/fprau420r detected more bacteria than fpr-2f/fprau645r. conclusion: the three primer pairs can detect f. prausnitzii and subdoligranulum  spp., however, the specificity of fpr-2f/fprau645r is better than fpr-1/fpr-2 and fprau223f/fprau420r.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == diversity of the autochthonous colonic microbiota.
AB  == a longstanding hypothesis in intestinal microbial ecology is that autochthonous microbes (resident) play a role that is distinct from allochthonous microbes (transient microbes in the fecal stream). a challenge has been to identify this pool of microbes. we used laser capture microdissection to collect microbes from  the mouse ascending colon. this area contains transverse folds that mimic human intestinal folds and contains a distinct population of intestinal microbes that is associated with the mucosa. our analysis of bacterial 16s rrna genes showed that this area was enriched for lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae. in this addendum, we further compare this community to studies of mucosa-associated microbes in humans. this analysis reveals common phylogenetic groups of bacteria  that are present in both mouse and human. however, we found microorganisms at the genus and species levels including faecalibacterium prausnitzii which appears to  be specific for humans. we propose that that examination of the mucosa-associated microbes in wild type and genetically modified mice will be a valuable component  to define host microbial interactions that are essential for homeostasis.
