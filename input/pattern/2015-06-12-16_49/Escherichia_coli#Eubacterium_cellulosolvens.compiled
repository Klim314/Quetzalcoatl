TI  - Identification and functional expression of genes encoding flavonoid O- and C-glycosidases in intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Gut bacteria play a crucial role in the metabolism of dietary flavonoids and thereby influence the bioactivity of these compounds in the host. The intestinal Lachnospiraceae strain CG19-1 and Eubacterium cellulosolvens are able to deglycosylate C- and O-coupled flavonoid glucosides. Growth of strain CG19-1 in the presence of the isoflavone C-glucoside puerarin (daidzein 8-C-glucoside) led to the induction of two proteins (DfgC, DfgD). Heterologous expression of the encoding genes (dfgC, dfgD) in Escherichia coli revealed no C-deglycosylating activity in the resulting cell extracts but cleavage of flavonoid O-glucosides such as daidzin (daidzein 7-O-glucoside). The recombinant DfgC and DfgD proteins were purified and characterized with respect to their quaternary structure, substrate and cofactor specificity. The products of the corresponding genes (dfgC, dfgD) from E. cellulosolvens also catalysed the O-deglycosylation of daidzin following their expression in E. coli. In combination with three recombinant proteins encoded by adjacent genes in E. cellulosolvens (dfgA, dfgB, dfgE), DfgC and DfgD from E. cellulosolvens catalysed the deglycosylation of the flavone C-glucosides homoorientin (luteolin 6-C-glucoside) and isovitexin (apigenin 6-C-glucoside). Even intact cells of E. coli expressing the five E. cellulosolvens genes cleaved these flavone C-glucosides and, also, flavonoid O-glucosides to the corresponding aglycones.
TI  - Understanding how noncatalytic carbohydrate binding modules can display specificity for xyloglucan.
AB  - Plant biomass is central to the carbon cycle and to environmentally sustainable industries exemplified by the biofuel sector. Plant cell wall degrading enzymes generally contain noncatalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) that fulfil a targeting function, which enhances catalysis. CBMs that bind beta-glucan chains often display broad specificity recognizing beta1,4-glucans (cellulose), beta1,3-beta1,4-mixed linked glucans and xyloglucan, a beta1,4-glucan decorated with alpha1,6-xylose residues, by targeting structures common to the three polysaccharides. Thus, CBMs that recognize xyloglucan target the beta1,4-glucan backbone and only accommodate the xylose decorations. Here we show that two closely related CBMs, CBM65A and CBM65B, derived from EcCel5A, a Eubacterium cellulosolvens endoglucanase, bind to a range of beta-glucans but, uniquely, display significant preference for xyloglucan. The structures of the two CBMs reveal a beta-sandwich fold. The ligand binding site comprises the beta-sheet that forms the concave surface of the proteins. Binding to the backbone chains of beta-glucans is mediated primarily by five aromatic residues that also make hydrophobic interactions with the xylose side chains of xyloglucan, conferring the distinctive specificity of the CBMs for the decorated polysaccharide. Significantly, and in contrast to other CBMs that recognize beta-glucans, CBM65A utilizes different polar residues to bind cellulose and mixed linked glucans. Thus, Gln(106) is central to cellulose recognition, but is not required for binding to mixed linked glucans. This report reveals the mechanism by which beta-glucan-specific CBMs can distinguish between linear and mixed linked glucans, and show how these CBMs can exploit an extensive hydrophobic platform to target the side chains of decorated beta-glucans.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene for cellobiose 2-epimerase from a ruminal strain of Eubacterium cellulosolvens.
AB  - Cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE; EC 5.1.3.11) is known to catalyze the reversible epimerization of cellobiose to 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannose in Ruminococcus albus cells. Here, we report a CE in a ruminal strain of Eubacterium cellulosolvens for the first time. The nucleotide sequence of the CE had an ORF of 1218 bp (405 amino acids; 46 963.3 Da). The CE from E. cellulosolvens showed 44-54% identity to N-acyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase-like hypothetical proteins in the genomes of Coprococcus eutactus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium phytofermentans, Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, and Eubacterium siraeum. Surprisingly, it exhibited only 46% identity to a CE from R. albus. The recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli was purified by two-step chromatography. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 46.7 kDa and exhibited optimal activity at around 35 degrees C and pH 7.0-8.5. In addition to cello-oligosaccharides, it converted lactose to epilactose (4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-D-mannose).
TI  - Biochemical characterization of cellulose-binding proteins (CBPA and CBPB) from the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Eubacterium cellulosolvens 5.
AB  - The cellulose-binding proteins, CBPA and CBPB, of rumen cellulolytic bacterium Eubacterium cellulosolvens 5 were biochemically characterized, and their properties were compared. Recombinant CBPA and CBPB were a typical 1,4-beta-endoglucanase. Both proteins bound to insoluble polysaccharides such as Avicel cellulose, acid swollen cellulose, lichenan, chitin, and oat spelt xylan. On the other hand, only recombinant CBPB bound to agarose and starch.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of a Eubacterium cellulosolvens 5 gene encoding an endoglucanase (Cel5A) with novel carbohydrate-binding modules, and properties of Cel5A.
AB  - A novel Eubacterium cellulosolvens 5 gene encoding an endoglucanase (Cel5A) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and its enzymatic properties were characterized. The cel5A gene consists of a 3,444-bp open reading frame and encodes a 1,148-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 127,047 Da. Cel5A is a modular enzyme consisting of an N-terminal signal peptide, two glycosyl hydrolase family 5 catalytic modules, two novel carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), two linker sequences, and a C-terminal sequence with an unknown function. The amino acid sequences of the two catalytic modules and the two CBMs are 94% and 73% identical to each other, respectively. Two regions that consisted of one CBM and one catalytic module were tandemly connected via a linker sequence. The CBMs did not exhibit significant sequence similarity with any other CBMs. Analyses of the hydrolytic activity of the recombinant Cel5A (rCel5A) comprising the CBMs and the catalytic modules showed that the enzyme is an endoglucanase with activities with carboxymethyl cellulose, lichenan, acid-swollen cellulose, and oat spelt xylan. To investigate the functions of the CBMs and the catalytic modules, truncated derivatives of rCel5A were constructed and characterized. There were no differences in the hydrolytic activities with various polysaccharides or in the hydrolytic products obtained from cellooligosaccharides between the two catalytic modules. Both CBMs had the same substrate affinity with intact rCel5A. Removal of the CBMs from rCel5A reduced the catalytic activities with various polysaccharides remarkably. These observations show that CBMs play an important role in the catalytic function of the enzyme.
TI  - Identification of the cellulose-binding and the cell wall-binding domains of Eubacterium cellulosolvens 5 cellulose-binding protein A (CBPA).
AB  - The cellulose-binding domain (CBD) and the cell wall-binding domain (CWBD) of Eubacterium cellulosolvens 5 cellulose-binding protein A (CBPA) have been determined. The gene (cbpA) encoding CBPA and its derivatives were expressed in Escherichia coli. We were able to obtain the eight recombinant proteins and examine for their cellulose-binding ability, cell wall-binding ability and carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) activity. Since five recombinant proteins, which contain the unknown domain (UD-2) located between two linker-like regions of CBPA, bound to cellulose, this region has been identified as the CBD. The CBD did not show a significant sequence similarity with any other CBDs. Moreover, the N-terminal region of CBPA showed a significant sequence similarity with a catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolase family 9, and the recombinant proteins containing the region showed CMCase activity. Since the UD-3, which is located in the C-terminal region of CBPA, bound to the cell walls of E. cellulosolvens 5, the region has been identified as the CWBD. However, the CWBD did not show a significant sequence similarity with any other proteins previously reported.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence and expression of the gene encoding the cellulose-binding protein A (CBPA) of Eubacterium cellulosolvens 5.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the cellulose-binding protein A (CBPA) of Eubacterium cellulosolvens 5 was determined. The gene consists of an open reading frame of 3453 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 1151 amino acids with a molecular mass of 126408 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of CBPA contained one domain highly similar to a catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolases belonging to family 9, two linker-like domains and four domains of unknown function. Among the four domains of unknown function, the domains 1 and 2 region had significant homology in amino acid sequence with the cellulose-binding domains in the family 9 glycosyl hydrolases. The cloned gene was inserted into an expression vector, pBAD-TOPO, and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fused protein. The fused protein was detected by immunoblotting using antiserum against CBPA.
