TI  == rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  == eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate  tests. identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting prevotella species, bacteroides forsythus, three capnocytophaga species, six actinomyces species, four propionibacterium species, and eight streptococcus species. two mannoside isomers differentiated actinomyces israelii and actinomyces gerencseriae. in addition to  porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus, and capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium alocis, actinomyces odontolyticus, actinomyces meyeri, and bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. the method was ideal for rapidly obtaining  presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as sds-page.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of azithromycin, macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin and spiramycin) and streptogramin rp 59500 against oral organisms.
AB  == the in-vitro activities of azithromycin, clarithromycin, spiramycin and rp 59500  were compared with erythromycin against a wide range of oral organisms which have been implicated in oral infections and/or endocarditis (clindamycin was included  for oral streptococci). all compounds tested showed good activity against many of these organisms, although some variation was observed with different species. clarithromycin was the most active of the antibiotics tested against gram-positive anaerobes, including actinomyces spp., propionibacterium spp., lactobacillus spp. and bifidobacterium dentium. azithromycin was slightly less active than erythromycin against these species. in general, rp 59500 had higher mics than the macrolides, other than spiramycin, against these organisms, but was superior in activity against peptostreptococcus spp., inhibiting all isolates at  2 mg/l. azithromycin was, in general, the most active antibiotic tested against the gram-negative anaerobes: fusobacterium spp., bacteroides spp., wolinella spp., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, selenomonas spp. and mitsuokella multiacida, including those isolates which were insusceptible to erythromycin. clarithromycin showed similar activity to erythromycin against most gram-negative species, but was superior against capnocytophaga ochraceus and eikenella corrodens. rp 59500 was less active than the macrolides against most gram-negative anaerobes, but was superior to erythromycin and clarithromycin against fusobacterium spp. and leptotrichia buccalis, some strains of which were  moderately resistant to erythromycin. the macrolides and clindamycin were about equally active against the oral streptococci, whereas rp 59500 showed lower inhibitory activity. the in-vitro results suggest that azithromycin and clarithromycin may be of value in the treatment of dental sepsis and the prophylaxis of endocarditis. rp 59500 showed useful activity against gram-positive anaerobes and, because of its bactericidal activity against oral streptococci, may also prove to have a role in these areas.
