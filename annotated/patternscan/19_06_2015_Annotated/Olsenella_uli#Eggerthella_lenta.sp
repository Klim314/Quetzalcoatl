TI  == dynamics and diversity of the 'atopobium cluster' in the human faecal microbiota, and phenotypic characterization of 'atopobium cluster' isolates.
AB  == this study monitored the dynamics and diversity of the human faecal 'atopobium cluster' over a 3-month period using a polyphasic approach. fresh faecal samples  were collected fortnightly from 13 healthy donors (six males and seven females) aged between 26 and 61 years. fish was used to enumerate total (eub338mix) and 'atopobium cluster' (ato291) bacteria, with counts ranging between 1.12x10(11) and 9.95x10(11), and 1.03x10(9) and 1.16x10(11) cells (g dry weight faeces)(-1),  respectively. the 'atopobium cluster' population represented 0.2-22 % of the total bacteria, with proportions donor-dependent. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) using 'atopobium cluster'-specific primers demonstrated faecal populations of these bacteria were relatively stable, with bands identified as collinsella aerofaciens, collinsella intestinalis/collinsella stercoris, collinsella tanakaei, coriobacteriaceae sp. peav3-3, eggerthella lenta, gordonibacter pamelaeae, olsenella profusa, olsenella uli and paraeggerthella hongkongensis in the dgge profiles of individuals. colony pcr was used to identify 'atopobium cluster' bacteria isolated from faeces (n = 224 isolates). 16s rrna gene sequence analysis of isolates demonstrated collinsella aerofaciens represented the predominant (88 % of isolates) member of the 'atopobium cluster' found in human faeces, being found in nine individuals. eggerthella lenta was identified in three individuals (3.6 % of isolates). isolates of collinsella tanakaei, an 'enorma' sp. and representatives of novel species belonging to the 'atopobium cluster' were also identified in the study. phenotypic characterization of the isolates demonstrated their highly saccharolytic nature and heterogeneous phenotypic profiles, and 97 % of the isolates displayed lipase activity.

TI  == anaerobic, non-sporulating, gram-positive bacilli bacteraemia characterized by 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == owing to the difficulties in identifying anaerobic, non-sporulating, gram-positive bacilli in clinical microbiology laboratories, the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of disease of many of these bacteria have been poorly understood. the application of 16s rrna gene sequencing in characterizing bacteraemia due to anaerobic, non-sporulating gram-positive bacilli during a 4-year period is described. the first case of olsenella uli bacteraemia, in a patient with acute cholangitis, is also reported. among 165 blood culture isolates of anaerobic, gram-positive bacilli, 75 were identified as propionibacterium acnes by phenotypic tests and 21 as members of other anaerobic, non-sporulating gram-positive bacilli by 16s rrna gene sequencing. of these 96 isolates, 16 (17 %) were associated with cases of clinically significant bacteraemia, among which 10 (63 %) were caused by eggerthella, four (25 %) by lactobacillus and one (6 %) by each of eubacterium tenue and o. uli. five of the  10 eggerthella isolates were eggerthella lenta, whereas the other five belonged to two novel eggerthella species, with eggerthella hongkongensis being almost as  prevalent as eggerthella lenta. underlying disease in the gastrointestinal tract, isolation of eggerthella and lactobacillus, and monomicrobial bacteraemia were associated with clinically significant bacteraemia, whereas isolation of p. acnes and polymicrobial bacteraemia were associated with pseudobacteraemia. most patients with clinically significant bacteraemia had underlying diseases, with diseases in the gastrointestinal tract being most common. the overall mortality rate was 31 %. immunocompromised patients with clinically significant bacteraemia due to anaerobic, non-sporulating, gram-positive bacilli other than p. acnes should be treated with appropriate antibiotics. the unexpected frequency of isolation of eggerthella from blood cultures and its association with clinically  significant disease suggest that this genus is probably of high pathogenicity. further studies to look for specific virulence factors are warranted.
