TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
