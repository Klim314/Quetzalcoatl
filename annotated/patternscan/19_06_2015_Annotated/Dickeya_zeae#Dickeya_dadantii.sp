TI  == phylogeny and classification of dickeya based on multilocus sequence analysis.
AB  == bacterial heart rot of pineapple reported in hawaii in 2003 and reoccurring in 2006 was caused by an undetermined species of dickeya. classification of the bacterial strains isolated from infected pineapple to one of the recognized dickeya species and their phylogenetic relationships with dickeya were determined by a multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa), based on the partial gene sequences of  dnaa, dnaj, dnax, gyrb and recn. individual and concatenated gene phylogenies revealed that the strains form a clade with reference dickeya sp. isolated from pineapple in malaysia and are closely related to d. zeae; however, previous dna-dna reassociation values suggest that these strains do not meet the genomic threshold for consideration in d. zeae, and require further taxonomic analysis. an analysis of the markers used in this mlsa determined that recn was the best overall marker for resolution of species within dickeya. differential intraspecies resolution was observed with the other markers, suggesting that marker selection is important for defining relationships within a clade. phylogenies produced with gene sequences from the sequenced genomes of strains d. dadantii ech586, d. dadantii ech703 and d. zeae ech1591 did not place the sequenced strains with members of other well-characterized members of their respective species. the average nucleotide identity (ani) and tetranucleotide frequencies determined for the sequenced strains corroborated the results of the  mlsa that d. dadantii ech586 and d. dadantii ech703 should be reclassified as dickeya zeae ech586 and dickeya paradisiaca ech703, respectively, whereas d. zeae ech1591 should be reclassified as dickeya chrysanthemi ech1591.

TI  == sequence diversity in the dickeya flic gene: phylogeny of the dickeya genus and taqman(r) pcr for 'd. solani', new biovar 3 variant on potato in europe.
AB  == worldwide, dickeya (formerly erwinia chrysanthemi) is causing soft rot diseases on a large diversity of crops and ornamental plants. strains affecting potato are mainly found in d. dadantii, d. dianthicola and d. zeae, which appear to have a marked geographical distribution. furthermore, a few dickeya isolates from potato are attributed to d. chrysanthemi and d. dieffenbachiae. in europe, isolates of erwinia chrysanthemi biovar 1 and biovar 7 from potato are now classified in d. dianthicola. however, in the past few years, a new dickeya biovar 3 variant, tentatively named 'dickeya solani', has emerged as a common major threat, in particular in seed potatoes. sequences of a flic gene fragment were used to generate a phylogeny of dickeya reference strains from culture collections and with this reference backbone, to classify pectinolytic isolates, i.e. dickeya spp. from potato and ornamental plants. the reference strains of the currently recognized dickeya species and 'd. solani' were unambiguously delineated in the flic phylogram. d. dadantii, d. dianthicola and 'd. solani' displayed unbranched  clades, while d. chrysanthemi, d. zeae and d. dieffenbachiae branched into subclades and lineages. moreover, dickeya isolates from diagnostic samples, in particular biovar 3 isolates from greenhouse ornamentals, formed several new lineages. most of these isolates were positioned between the clade of 'd. solani' and d. dadantii as transition variants. new lineages also appeared in d. dieffenbachiae and in d. zeae. the strains and isolates of d. dianthicola and 'd. solani' were differentiated by a flic sequence useful for barcode identification. a flic taqman(r)real-time pcr was developed for 'd. solani' and the assay was provisionally evaluated in direct analysis of diagnostic potato samples. this molecular tool can support the efforts to control this particular phytopathogen in seed potato certification.

TI  == specificity of monoclonal antibodies to strains of dickeya sp. that cause bacterial heart rot of pineapple.
AB  == during a severe outbreak of bacterial heart rot that occurred in pineapple plantations on oahu, hawaii, in 2003 and years following, 43 bacterial strains were isolated from diseased plants or irrigation water and identified as erwinia  chrysanthemi (now dickeya sp.) by phenotypic, molecular, and pathogenicity assays. rep-pcr fingerprint patterns grouped strains from pineapple plants and irrigation water into five genotypes (a-e) that differed from representatives of  other dickeya species, pectobacterium carotovorum and other enteric saprophytes isolated from pineapple. monoclonal antibodies produced following immunization of mice with virulent type c dickeya sp. showed only two specificities. mab pine-1 (2d11g1, igg1 with kappa light chain) reacted to all 43 pineapple/water strains and some reference strains (d. dianthicola, d. chrysanthemi, d. paradisiaca, some d. dadantii, and uncharacterized dickeya sp.) but did not react to reference strains of d. dieffenbachiae, d. zeae, or one of the two malaysian pineapple strains. mab pine-2 (2a7f2, igg3 with kappa light chain) reacted to all type b, c, and d strains but not to any a or e strains or any reference strains except dickeya sp. isolated from malaysian pineapple. pathogenicity tests showed that type c strains were more aggressive than type a strains when inoculated during cool months. therefore, mab pine-2 distinguishes the more virulent type c strains from less virulent type a pineapple strains and type e water strains. mabs with these two specificities enable development of rapid diagnostic tests that will distinguish the systemic heart rot pathogen from opportunistic bacteria associated with rotted tissues. use of the two mabs in field assays also permits  the monitoring of a known subpopulation and provides additional decision tools for disease containment and management practices.

TI  == dickeya species relatedness and clade structure determined by comparison of reca  sequences.
AB  == using sequences from the reca locus, we have produced a phylogeny of 188 dickeya  strains from culture collections and identified species relatedness and subspecies clade structure within the genus. of the six recognized species, dickeya paradisiaca, d. chrysanthemi and d. zeae were discriminated with long branch lengths. the clade containing the d. paradisiaca type strain included just one additional strain, isolated from banana in colombia. strains isolated from chrysanthemum and parthenium species made up most of the clade containing the d.  chrysanthemi type strain, and the host range of this species was extended to include potato. the d. zeae clade had the largest number of sequevars and branched into two major sister clades that contained all of the zea mays isolates, and were identified as phylotypes pi and pii. the host range was increased from six to 13 species, including potato. the reca sequence of an australian sugar-cane strain was sufficiently distinct to rank as a new species-level branch. in contrast to these species, dickeya dadantii, d. dianthicola and d. dieffenbachiae were distinguished with shorter branch lengths, indicating relatively closer relatedness. the reca sequence for the type strain of d. dadantii clustered separately from other strains of the species. however, sequence comparison of three additional loci revealed that the d. dadantii type strain grouped together with the six other d. dadantii strains that were sequenced. analysis of all four loci indicated that the d. dadantii strains were  most closely related to d. dieffenbachiae. three further branches (duc-1, -2 and  -3) were associated with these three species, which all diverged from a common origin and can be considered as a species complex. the large clade containing the d. dianthicola type strain comprised 58 strains and had little sequence diversity. one sequevar accounted for the majority of these strains, which were isolated nearly exclusively from eight hosts from europe. isolation of this sequevar on multiple occasions from dianthus and (more recently) potato demonstrates that this lineage has become established in these species. the d. dadantii clade comprised 11 sequevars, and the known host range of the species was extended from eight to 19 species. new hosts included several ornamental species and potato. the clade duc-1 was made up exclusively of potato strains originating from europe, which had identical sequences, whilst duc-2 strains were isolated mostly from a variety of monocotyledonous species. a single strain from  aglaonema sp. made up duc-3. a single sequevar constituted the d. dieffenbachiae  clade. the phylogenetic method described will provide a simple means for identification to the species and intraspecies level, which will support efforts  to control these pathogens based on monitoring and surveillance.

TI  == transfer of pectobacterium chrysanthemi (burkholder et al. 1953) brenner et al. 1973 and brenneria paradisiaca to the genus dickeya gen. nov. as dickeya chrysanthemi comb. nov. and dickeya paradisiaca comb. nov. and delineation of four novel species, dickeya dadantii sp. nov., dickeya dianthicola sp. nov., dickeya dieffenbachiae sp. nov. and dickeya zeae sp. nov.
AB  == a collection of 75 strains of pectobacterium chrysanthemi (including all biovars  and pathovars) and the type strains of brenneria paradisiaca (cfbp 4178(t)) and pectobacterium cypripedii (cfbp 3613(t)) were studied by dna-dna hybridization, numerical taxonomy of 121 phenotypic characteristics, serology and 16s rrna gene-based phylogenetic analyses. from analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences, it was deduced that p. chrysanthemi strains and b. paradisiaca cfbp 4178(t) formed a clade distinct from the genera pectobacterium and brenneria; therefore, it is proposed to transfer all the strains to a novel genus, dickeya gen. nov. by dna-dna hybridization, the strains of p. chrysanthemi were distributed among six  genomic species: genomospecies 1 harbouring 16 strains of biovar 3 and four strains of biovar 8, genomospecies 2 harbouring 16 strains of biovar 3, genomospecies 3 harbouring two strains of biovar 6 and five strains of biovar 5,  genomospecies 4 harbouring five strains of biovar 2, genomospecies 5 harbouring six strains of biovar 1, four strains of biovar 7 and five strains of biovar 9 and genomospecies 6 harbouring five strains of biovar 4 and b. paradisiaca cfbp 4178(t). two strains of biovar 3 remained unclustered. biochemical criteria, deduced from a numerical taxonomic study of phenotypic characteristics, and serological reactions allowed discrimination of the strains belonging to the six  genomic species. thus, it is proposed that the strains clustered in these six genomic species be assigned to the species dickeya zeae sp. nov. (type strain cfbp 2052(t)=ncppb 2538(t)), dickeya dadantii sp. nov. (type strain cfbp 1269(t)=ncppb 898(t)), dickeya chrysanthemi comb. nov. (subdivided into two biovars, bv. chrysanthemi and bv. parthenii), dickeya dieffenbachiae sp. nov. (type strain cfbp 2051(t)=ncppb 2976(t)), dickeya dianthicola sp. nov. (type strain cfbp 1200(t)=ncppb 453(t)) and dickeya paradisiaca comb. nov., respectively.
