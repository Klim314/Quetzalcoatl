TI  - Construction of transposition insertion libraries and specific gene inactivation  in the pathogen Lactococcus garvieae.
AB  - This paper reports the development of genetic tools in Lactococcus garvieae, an important Gram-positive bacterial pathogen affecting both fish and mammals. The vector pGKV210, a broad host range vector, was introduced by electroporation into L. garvieae UNIUD074. The maximal frequency obtained was 3.2 x 10(5) transformants/mug of DNA. Moreover, this effect is highly reproducible and appears to be constant, since all L. garvieae strains tested were transformed. Once the optimal transformation procedure was established, it was used to generate isogenic and transposition mutants. Insertional mutagenesis of the L. garvieae SA9H10L gene, similar to a Streptococcus pyogenes gene encoding the M protein (emm64), was carried out using the conditional replication plasmid pORI19. Transposition mutagenesis using the streptococcal temperature-sensitive suicide vector pTV408 to deliver Tn917 into the chromosome of L. garvieae was also achieved at a frequency of ca. 10(-4). Transposon flanking DNA sequences were obtained by plasmid rescue in Escherichia coli and their sequencing analysis demonstrated that the transposon was inserted at different chromosomal loci. Tn917 also made it possible to select a mutant in the operon involved in mannitol fermentation in this microorganism. The results obtained in the present study lay the foundation for future research on the virulence mechanisms of L. garvieae.
TI  - Identification of genes in a KG- phenotype of Lactococcus garvieae, a fish pathogenic bacterium, whose proteins react with antiKG- rabbit serum.
AB  - Five different clones (SA1B05, SA1B10, SA2F01, SA8A11 and SA9H10) were isolated from the gene library of the Lactococcus garvieae SA8201 (KG-) strain by immunological screening using rabbit serum against L. garvieae (KG-) phenotype cells. A Western blot analysis indicated that the molecular sizes of immunologically detected proteins of SA1B05, SA1B10, SA2F01, SA8A11 and SA9H10, which were fused with LacZ protein, were 25, 30, 28, 26 and 13 kDa, respectively. The amino acid sequences of the immunologically detected proteins of SA1B05, SA1B10, SA2F01 and SA8A11 were homologous to a processing protease of Bacillus subtilis (36.6%), dihydropteroate synthase of Escherichia coli (34.6%), trigger factor of B. subtilis (45.8%) and N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase of Vibrio furnissii (37.1%), respectively. There was no significant homologous sequence of SA9H10 in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank and SwissProt. We cloned and sequenced a longer DNA fragment (SA9H10L) of SA9H10 from the gene library. The predicted amino acid sequence of this clone was weak homology to M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes (22.7%). Five genes were specifically expressed in the KG- phenotype strains. However, SA8A11 and SA9H10 was expressed in the mutated strain SA8201-TTC, whose serological phenotype was changed from KG- to KG+ by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride.
