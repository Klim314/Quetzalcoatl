TI  - Establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.
AB  - Ten specific primer sets, for Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus crispatus, Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, Chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy Japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: Lactobacilli such as L. crispatus, L. gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as Streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. Certain bacterial vaginosis (BV)-related bacteria, such as G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, M. curtisii, and Prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. Especially in one subject, both G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic BV patient. These results suggest that the RT-qPCR system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.
TI  - The composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women  is different from that of non-pregnant women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to characterize the vaginal microbiota throughout normal human pregnancy using sequence-based techniques. We compared the vaginal microbial composition of non-pregnant patients with a group of pregnant women who delivered at term. RESULTS: A retrospective case-control longitudinal study was designed and included non-pregnant women (n = 32) and pregnant women who delivered at term (38 to 42 weeks) without complications (n = 22). Serial samples of vaginal fluid were collected from both non-pregnant and pregnant patients. A 16S rRNA gene sequence-based survey was conducted using pyrosequencing to characterize the structure and stability of the vaginal microbiota. Linear mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations were used to identify the phylotypes whose relative abundance was different between the two study groups. The vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women was different from that of non-pregnant women (higher abundance of Lactobacillus vaginalis, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii and lower abundance of 22 other phylotypes in pregnant women). Bacterial community state type (CST) IV-B or CST IV-A characterized by high relative abundance of species of genus Atopobium as well as the presence of Prevotella, Sneathia, Gardnerella, Ruminococcaceae, Parvimonas, Mobiluncus and other taxa previously shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis were less frequent in normal pregnancy. The stability of the vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was higher than that of non-pregnant women; however, during normal pregnancy, bacterial communities shift almost exclusively from one CST dominated by Lactobacillus spp. to another CST dominated by Lactobacillus spp. CONCLUSION: We report the first longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota in normal pregnancy. Differences in the composition and stability of the microbial community between pregnant and non-pregnant women were observed. Lactobacillus spp. were the predominant members of the microbial community in normal pregnancy. These results can serve as the basis to study the relationship between the vaginal microbiome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - More than meets the eye: associations of vaginal bacteria with gram stain morphotypes using molecular phylogenetic analysis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a highly prevalent condition associated with adverse  health outcomes. Gram stain analysis of vaginal fluid is the standard for confirming the diagnosis of BV, wherein abundances of key bacterial morphotypes are assessed. These Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Bacteroides, and Mobiluncus morphotypes were originally linked to particular bacterial species through cultivation studies, but no studies have systematically investigated associations between uncultivated bacteria detected by molecular methods and Gram stain findings. In this study, 16S-rRNA PCR/pyrosequencing was used to examine associations between vaginal bacteria and bacterial morphotypes in 220 women with and without BV. Species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) and fluorescence in Situ hybridization (FISH) methods were used to document concentrations of two bacteria with curved rod morphologies: Mobiluncus and the fastidious BV-associated bacterium-1 (BVAB1). Rank abundance of vaginal bacteria in samples with evidence of curved gram-negative rods showed that BVAB1 was dominant (26.1%), while Mobiluncus was rare (0.2% of sequence reads). BVAB1 sequence reads were associated with Mobiluncus morphotypes (p<0.001). Among women with curved rods, mean concentration of BVAB1 DNA was 2 log units greater than Mobiluncus (p<0.001) using species-specific quantitative PCR. FISH analyses revealed that mean number of BVAB1 cells was 2 log units greater than Mobiluncus cells in women with highest Nugent score (p<0.001). Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were significantly associated with the "Bacteroides morphotype," whereas Bacteroides species were rare. Gram-negative rods designated Mobiluncus morphotypes on Gram stain are more likely BVAB1. These findings provide a clearer picture of the bacteria associated with morphotypes on vaginal Gram stain.
TI  - Biomedical applications of fermenticin HV6b isolated from Lactobacillus fermentum HV6b MTCC10770.
AB  - Fermenticin HV6b is a class IIa antimicrobial peptide produced by Lactobacillus fermentum HV6b MTCC 10770 isolated from human vaginal ecosystem. It shows growth inhibition of a wide range of opportunistic pathogens of humans, for example, Bacteroides, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, Staphylococci, and Streptococci, associated with bacterial vaginosis in humans. It does possess an impressive sperm immobilization and spermicidal activity tested against human sperms which makes it an attractive proposition for formulating antibacterial vaginosis and contraceptive products. Apart from this, in vitro studies conducted against four different tissue models have indicated its potential to be used as a component of anticancerous drug therapy as it is reported to induce apoptosis in cancerous cells. This information could be integrated in future studies focusing on in vivo assessment of anticancerous activity of lactic acid bacterial toxins or bacteriocins.
TI  - The anti-HIV microbicide candidate RC-101 inhibits pathogenic vaginal bacteria without harming endogenous flora or mucosa.
AB  - PROBLEM: Vaginal microbicides represent a promising approach for preventing heterosexual HIV transmission. However, preclinical evaluation should be conducted to ensure that microbicides will be safe for human cells and healthy microflora of the female reproductive tract. One microbicide candidate, RC-101, has been effective and well tolerated in preliminary cell culture and macaque models. However, the effect of RC-101 on primary vaginal tissues and resident vaginal microflora requires further evaluation. METHOD OF STUDY: We treated primary vaginal tissues and vaginal bacteria, both pathogenic and commensal, with RC-101 to investigate effects of this microbicide. RESULTS: RC-101 was well tolerated by host tissues, and also by commensal vaginal bacteria. Simultaneously, pathogenic vaginal bacteria, which are known to increase susceptibility to HIV acquisition, were inhibited by RC-101. CONCLUSIONS: By establishing vaginal microflora, the specific antibacterial activity of RC-101 may provide a dual mechanism of HIV protection. These findings support advancement of RC-101 to clinical trials.
TI  - Association between Trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal bacterial community composition among reproductive-age women.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Some vaginal bacterial communities are thought to prevent infection by sexually transmitted organisms. Prior work demonstrated that the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women cluster into 5 types of bacterial communities; 4 dominated by Lactobacillus species (L. iners, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii) and 1 (termed community state type (CST) IV) lacking significant numbers of lactobacilli and characterized by higher proportions of Atopobium, Prevotella, Parvimonas, Sneathia, Gardnerella, Mobiluncus, and other taxa. We sought to evaluate the relationship between vaginal bacterial composition and Trichomonas vaginalis. METHODS: Self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained cross-sectionally from 394 women equally representing 4 ethnic/racial groups. T. vaginalis screening was performed using PCR targeting the 18S rRNA and beta-tubulin genes. Vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA genes. A panel of 11 microsatellite markers was used to genotype T. vaginalis. The association between vaginal microbiota and T. vaginalis was evaluated by exact logistic regression. RESULTS: T. vaginalis was detected in 2.8% of participants (11/394). Of the 11 T. vaginalis-positive cases, 8 (72%) were categorized as CST-IV, 2 (18%) as communities dominated by L. iners, and 1 (9%) as L. crispatus-dominated (P = 0.05). CST-IV microbiota were associated with an 8-fold increased odds of detecting T. vaginalis compared with women in the L. crispatus-dominated state (OR: 8.26, 95% CI: 1.07-372.65). Seven of the 11 T. vaginalis isolates were assigned to 2 genotypes. CONCLUSION: T. vaginalis was associated with vaginal microbiota consisting of low proportions of lactobacilli and high proportions of Mycoplasma, Parvimonas, Sneathia, and other anaerobes.
TI  - Inguinal syndrome secondary to Prevotella bivia after accidental bite in orogenital sex.
AB  - The authors report a case of an inguinal bubo in a young man caused by an anaerobe, Prevotella bivia, which was acquired during oral sexual intercourse. As far as the authors know, this is the first reported case of a sexually transmitted infection by Prevotella. Prevotella spp. inhabit the oral cavity and are highly prevalent in bacterial vaginosis, a polymicrobial syndrome resulting from replacement of the normal vaginal Lactobacillus spp. flora by high concentrations of anaerobic microorganisms such as Prevotella spp., Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and other uncultivated anaerobes.
TI  - The complex vaginal flora of West African women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spectrum of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) has recently expanded through taxonomic changes and the use of molecular methods. These methods have yet to be used in large-scale epidemiological studies in Africa where BV is highly prevalent. METHODS: An analysis of samples obtained during a clinical trial of the management of vaginal discharge in four West African countries. Samples were available from 1555 participants; 843 (54%) had BV. Nucleic acids of 13 bacterial genera or species potentially associated with BV were detected through the polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The associations between various components of the vaginal flora were complex. Excluding Lactobacillus, the other 12 micro-organisms were all associated with each other at the p</=0.001 level. The prevalence of various bacterial genera or species varied according to age, sexual activity and HIV status. In multivariate analysis, the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Bifidobacterium, Megasphaera elsdenii, Dialister, Mycoplasma hominis, Leptotrichia, and Prevotella were independently associated with BV as was the absence of Lactobacillus and Peptoniphilus. However, Mobiluncus, Atopobium vaginae, Anaerococcus, and Eggerthella were not independently associated with BV. Unexpectedly, after treatment with a regimen that included either metronidazole or tinidazole, the proportion of patients with a complete resolution of symptoms by day 14 increased with the number of bacterial genera or species present at enrolment. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous bacterial genera or species were strongly associated with each other in a pattern that suggested a symbiotic relationship. BV cases with a simpler flora were less likely to respond to treatment. Overall, the vaginal flora of West African women with BV was reminiscent of that of their counterparts in industrialized countries.
TI  - [Clinical and microbiological profile of women with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - PURPOSE: to study the clinical and microbiological profile of women with bacterial vaginosis participating in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, which compared the vaginal use of preparations from red pepper tree and metronidazole for the treatment of genital discharge. METHODS: the study was conducted on a series of 277 women with bacterial vaginosis concomitantly diagnosed by the criteria of Amsel and Nugent, selected from a total of 462 recruited patients using the information obtained before intervention. Data were analyzed with the Epi-Info 3.32 software. In order to compare the outcomes frequencies between the intervention groups, the chi2 test was used and the risk ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated. The intention to treat analysis was performed. In addition to the determination of diagnostic parameters, the culture of vaginal content and a Papanicolaou cytology test were also performed. RESULTS: the most frequent clinical complaints were genital discharge, observed in 206 participants (74.4%) and the fish odor of the vaginal secretion, which occurred in 68.6% of the cases (190 patients). Among the diagnostic clinical criteria, the presence of clue-cells was positive in 275 women (99.3%), the Whiff test, in 266 (96.0%), followed by pH >4.5, which occurred in 92.8% of the cases, and by the presence of fluid grayish discharge reported by 206 participants (74.4%). Regarding the Nugent criterion, the median score was 8.0. Culture of the vaginal content permitted the identification of Gardnerella vaginalis in 96.8% of cases and of Mobiluncus in 53.1%. Only one third of the exams showed the presence of Lactobacillus (89 women - 32.1%). Fungal growth occurred in the cultures of 14 participants (5.1%). In most cases, culture revealed the presence of Corynebacterium (94.2%), Gram-positive cocci (98.2%), as well as Gram-positive (99.3%) and Gram-negative (91.0%) bacilli. Oncotic colposcopy revealed a very scarce presence of lactobacilli, which were present in only 8 cytological exams (2.9%) out of the total of 273 exams performed. CONCLUSIONS: the results of the present study did not differ from the literature regarding the symptoms reported by the women, the clinical criteria most frequently observed in the diagnosis, or the bacterial species detected in cultures of vaginal content. These findings indicate the need for further studies that might better elucidate the interrelations between the microbiological findings and the clinical expression of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - In vitro inhibitory activity of human vaginal lactobacilli against pathogenic bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis in Kenyan women.
AB  - Lactobacilli have been shown to inhibit in vitro growth of many pathogens and have been used as probiotics to treat a broad range of gastrointestinal and/or vaginal disorders. We sought to determine the in vitro inhibitory potential of lactobacilli of vaginal origin to some bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), to characterize the inhibitory substances produced by these lactobacilli and to assess H2O2 production. Vaginal specimens were obtained by swabbing the lateral vaginal walls from 107 women two months following BV treatment. One hundred and fifty eight Lactobacillus spp. were isolated in 82 of the 107 women. Lactobacillus jensenii was the predominant strain isolated among these women (29/158; 18.4%). Among 158 culture supernatants tested for antibacterial activity against BV-associated bacteria, none inhibited the growth of Bacteroides fragilis while 23% (37/158), 28% (45/158) and 29% (46/158) inhibited the growth of Prevotella bivia, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp. respectively. The lactobacilli produced supernatants with a pH range between 2.62 and 6.71; the highly acidic (pH 2-3.99) supernatants were more inhibitory to the indicator strains. There was significant reduction in the mean zones of inhibition following chemical and physical treatment of the supernatants (p = 0.0025). Acid, bacteriocins and H2O2 demonstrated potential for antagonism of the bacterial pathogens. These substances may augment each other rather that each working independently on the pathogens.
TI  - Longitudinal trajectory of bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to characterize the course of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy and to discern the bacterial morphotypes responsible for infection. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal secretions were obtained in each trimester of pregnancy and were evaluated for bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain, categorized as normal or any of the following: Lactobacillus deficient, Gardnerella, Bacteroides, or Mobiluncus positive and by Nugent score. Results were evaluated for trends of bacterial vaginosis and Gram stain over pregnancy. RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight women were evaluated. Seventy-one women (48%) were bacterial vaginosis negative in all trimesters, compared with 14 (9.4%) who were positive throughout pregnancy. Among the 14 women who remained bacterial vaginosis positive, Gram stain findings were Gardnerella+Bacteroides+Lactobacillus, with approximately 50% harboring Mobiluncus. Few women become bacterial vaginosis positive as pregnancy progressed (6.1%). With each increasing week of pregnancy, the risk of becoming bacterial vaginosis positive decreased (0.93: 0.91-0.95; P < .001). CONCLUSION: In this population, the majority of pregnant women trend toward bacterial vaginosis negative status. Few women are bacterial vaginosis positive across their pregnancy.
TI  - Quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in Port-A-Cul and Copan transport systems.
AB  - Transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. In this study, the Port-A-Cul transport system and the Copan transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. Dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. Combination I contained Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Combination II contained Lactobacillus iners, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Mobiluncus curtisii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees C. Both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. Prevotella bivia and Prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. However, at 24 degrees C, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in Copan transport medium than when they were stored in Port-A-Cul transport medium for 96 h (P < 0.002). Some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees C for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group B streptococci and Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. organisms in Copan medium than in Port-A-Cul medium was observed (P < 0.002). At room temperature, the Port-A-Cul system is superior to the Copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.
TI  - Molecular quantification of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae loads to  predict bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a poorly detected public health problem that is associated with preterm delivery and for which no reliable diagnostic tool exists. METHODS: Molecular analysis of 231 vaginal samples, classified by Gram stain-based Nugent score, was used to propose molecular criteria for BV; these criteria were prospectively applied to 56 new samples. A quantitative molecular tool targeting 8 BV-related microorganisms and a human gene was developed using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension. The targeted microorganisms were Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus species, Mobiluncus curtisii, Mobiluncus mulieris, and Candida albicans (which can be identified by Gram staining), as well as Atopobium vaginae, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum (which cannot be detected by Gram staining). RESULTS: With use of the Nugent score, 167 samples were classified as normal, 20 were classified as BV, and 44 were classified as intermediate. Except for U. urealyticum, M. mulieris, and Lactobacillus species, DNA of the tested bacteria was detected more frequently in samples demonstrating BV, but the predictive value of such detection was low. The molecular quantification of A. vaginae (DNA level, > or = 10(8) copies/mL) and G. vaginalis (DNA level, > or = 10(9) copies/mL) had the highest predictive value for the diagnosis of BV, with excellent sensitivity (95%), specificity (99%), and positive (95%) and negative (99%) predictive values; 25 (57%) of the samples demonstrating intermediate flora had a BV profile. When applied prospectively, our molecular criteria had total positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 99%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report a highly reproducible, quantitative tool to objectively analyze vaginal flora that uses cutoff values for the concentrations of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis to establish the molecular diagnosis of BV.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - [The bacterial vaginosis--treatment problems].
AB  - The changes in vaginal ecosystem (decreasing number of H2O2 producing Lactobacillus spp. and increasing number of Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp.) appears to be a major cause of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Bacterial vaginosis is associated with infectious complications in pregnant and non-pregnant women and increasing risk of STI. The preventive role of natural vaginal microflora and problems of BV treatment are discussed in the light of the recent publications.
TI  - The International Infections in Pregnancy (IIP) study: variations in the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and distribution of morphotypes in vaginal smears among pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and the distribution of associated morphotypes among asymptomatic pregnant women in different countries. STUDY DESIGN: In 8 institutions participating in the Global Network for Perinatal and Reproductive Health (www.gnprh.org) from July 1999 to September 2001, 1466 women were enrolled. Vaginal smears were Gram stained and scored with Nugent's method at a reference laboratory. The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and bacterial morphotype distributions were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 12.3% of women had bacterial vaginosis according to Nugent's criteria. Zimbabwe had the highest prevalence (24.4%) when compared with all other sites, except Myanmar (P < .05). Among bacterial vaginosis cases, 98.9% of vaginal smears had more than 30 Gardnerella/Bacteroides morphotypes present per oil immersion field. Individual centers showed significant differences in the number of Mobiluncus and lactobacillus morphotypes (P < .01). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and distribution of bacterial morphotypes in vaginal smears among asymptomatic pregnant women vary significantly in populations from different countries.
TI  - [Vaginosis in patients with antenatal foetus death].
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of bacterial vaginosis as well as of vaginal anaerobe flora (Mycoplasma Hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mobiluncus curtisii) was performed in women with antenatal foetus death. Specimens from forty women with this pathology were studied. Control group consisted of 100 pregnant women of the adequate age groups and gestation periods, but with live foetus. Vaginal smears treated by the use of polymerase chain reaction method showed that in the cases of antenatal foetus death in 70% of women Lactobacillus spp. was completely absent. This bacterium was observed only in 30% of these women. In 75% of women with live foetus Lactobacillus spp. was observed, while in 25% it was not present. Increase of quantity of anaerobic vaginal flora was observed in women, where the antenatal death of foetus was diagnosed. Percentage significance of these indices in women with live foetus was comparatively lower.
TI  - Treatment and management of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: current and future  perspectives.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis accounts for the majority of cases of vaginal discharge and has been consistently linked to an increased risk of preterm delivery. Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by the reduced number or absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus spp., which promotes the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Bacteroides spp., and Mobiluncus spp. Black race, higher-risk sexual activity, frequent vaginal douching and the substantial reduction of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus spp. are the main predictors of bacterial vaginosis development. Clinical- and laboratory-based bacterial vaginosis diagnostic tests are widely used to screen for bacterial vaginosis but, more recently, office-based bacterial vaginosis screening tools have been developed. Although systemic treatment for bacterial vaginosis with metronidazole or clindamycin has been demonstrated to be effective in the short-term cure of bacterial vaginosis, recurrence of bacterial vaginosis within 3 months of treatment is common, and treatment for bacterial vaginosis using these strategies has not been effective in reducing the risk of preterm delivery.
TI  - Variation in microbiologic profiles among pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if clinical findings and sociodemographic variables among bacterial vaginosis (BV)-positive pregnant women are associated with different microbiologic profiles. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women were assessed for BV by Nugent criteria. BV+ women were separated into 6 mutually exclusive microbiologic groups. In unadjusted analyses, we compared (1) sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, and (2) 3 clinical characteristics among BV+ women with and without Mobiluncus (M+ vs M-). Unadjusted data were analyzed using the chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the likelihood of having clinical signs of BV in women with and without Mobiluncus spp while controlling for confounders. RESULTS: A total of 1756 BV+ pregnant women were followed. The M+ group (n=702) was significantly more likely than the M- group (n=1054) to be non-Hispanic black (80.9% vs 66.2%; P < .0001), older than 21 years (61.7% vs 48.7%; P < .0001), and to have had more than 3 lifetime sexual partners (66.4% vs 54.9%; P < .0001). The M+ group was also more likely to have clue cells on wet mount (63.9% vs 47.2%; P < .0001) and a positive amine odor after addition of KOH (57.2% vs 45.0%; P=.001). There was no difference in other demographic variables or physician diagnosis of abnormal vaginal discharge. In the adjusted analyses for each clinical outcome, all findings were consistent with the unadjusted analyses. CONCLUSION: BV+ pregnant women with Mobiluncus spp are more likely to have clue cells present on wet mount, a positive amine odor after KOH preparation, and to be older, non-Hispanic black, and have had more lifetime sexual partners compared to BV+ women without any Mobiluncus species.
TI  - Vaginal flora morphotypic profiles and assessment of bacterial vaginosis in women at risk for HIV infection.
AB  - Specific morphotypic profiles of normal and abnormal vaginal flora, including bacterial vaginosis (BV), were characterized. A prospective study of 350 women yielded concurrent Gram-stain data and clinical assessment (n = 3455 visits). Microbiological profiles were constructed by Gram stain. Eight profile definitions were based on dichotomizing the levels of Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, and curved, Gram-negative bacillus (Mobiluncus) morphotypes. Of these, two were rare, and the other six demonstrated a graded association with the clinical components of BV. The proposed profiles from the Gram stain reflect the morphotypic categories describing vaginal flora that may enable clearer elucidation of gynecologic and obstetric outcomes in various populations.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis, vaginal flora patterns and vaginal hygiene practices in patients presenting with vaginal discharge syndrome in The Gambia, West Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) - a syndrome characterised by a shift in vaginal flora - appears to be particularly common in sub-Saharan Africa, but little is known of the pattern of vaginal flora associated with BV in Africa. We conducted a study aimed at determining the prevalence of BV and patterns of BV-associated vaginal micro-flora among women with vaginal discharge syndrome (VDS) in The Gambia, West Africa. METHODS: We enrolled 227 women with VDS from a large genito-urinary medicine clinic in Fajara, The Gambia. BV was diagnosed by the Nugent's score and Amsel's clinical criteria. Vaginal swabs were collected for T vaginalis and vaginal flora microscopy, and for Lactobacillus spp, aerobic organisms, Candida spp and BV-associated bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and Mycoplasma spp) cultures; and cervical swabs were collected for N gonorrhoeae culture and C trachomatis PCR. Sera were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. Sexual health history including details on sexual hygiene were obtained by standardised questionnaire. RESULTS: BV prevalence was 47.6% by Nugent's score and 30.8% by Amsel's clinical criteria. Lactobacillus spp were isolated in 37.8% of women, and 70% of the isolates were hydrogen-peroxide (H202)-producing strains. Prevalence of BV-associated bacteria were: G vaginalis 44.4%; Bacteroides 16.7%; Prevotella 15.2%; Peptostretococcus 1.5%; Mobiluncus 0%; other anaerobes 3.1%; and Mycoplasma hominis 21.4%. BV was positively associated with isolation of G vaginalis (odds-ratio [OR] 19.42, 95%CI 7.91 - 47.6) and anaerobes (P = 0.001 [OR] could not be calculated), but not with M hominis. BV was negatively associated with presence of Lactobacillus (OR 0.07, 95%CI 0.03 - 0.15), and H2O2-producing lactobacilli (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05 - 0.28). Presence of H2O2-producing lactobacilli was associated with significantly lower prevalence of G vaginalis, anaerobes and C trachomatis. HIV prevalence was 12.8%. Overall, there was no association between BV and HIV, and among micro-organisms associated with BV, only Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp. were associated with HIV. BV or vaginal flora patterns were not associated with any of the factors relating to sexual hygiene practices (vaginal douching, menstrual hygiene, female genital cutting). CONCLUSION: In this population, BV prevalence was higher than in corresponding populations in industrialised countries, but the pattern of vaginal micro-flora associated with BV was similar. BV or vaginal flora patterns were not associated with HIV nor with any of the vaginal hygiene characteristics.
TI  - [Frequency, diagnostic criteria and consequences of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women].
AB  - Vaginal discharge based on changes in a vaginal ecosystem (decreasing number of Lactobacillus and increasing number of Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella spp., Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp) appears to be a major cause of bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis is associated with: preterm delivery, premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, amniotic fluid infection, endometritis, low-weight neonates. The role of natural microflora of vagina, the most important diagnostic criteria, epidemiology and immunological changes in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis are discussed in the light of the recent publications.
TI  - Evolving issues in understanding and treating bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a synergistic polymicrobial syndrome characterized by depletion of Lactobacillus spp., especially those that produce hydrogen peroxide, and an intense increase in the quantity of commensal vaginal anaerobic bacteria to 100- to 1000-fold above normal levels. While the bacterial spectrum of these organisms has long been known to include Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella spp., anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, Mobiluncus spp. and Mycoplasma hominis, innovative use of molecular diagnostics has identified novel species apparently associated with this syndrome, including Atopobium vaginalis. Effecting resolution of bacterial vaginosis is important, in particular for the 8 to 23% of women afflicted with symptomatic disease during their reproductive years. Bacterial vaginosis has been consistently associated with numerous adverse sequelae related to the upper genital tract, including pelvic inflammatory disease and postsurgical infection in the setting of invasive gynecologic procedures, and may increase women's risk of acquiring HIV infection. Pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis experience a higher rate of preterm delivery and low-birth-weight infants. While antibiotics with activity against anaerobes--typically, metronidazole and clindamycin applied vaginally or taken orally--are the mainstays of therapy, bacterial vaginosis frequently recurs. For these reasons, innovative approaches to therapy are urgently required.
TI  - Nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a Gram stain of a vaginal smear. Treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. A study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of BV by the Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that Bacteroides or Prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. In one case, only Gardnerella vaginalis was found. These findings illustrate that BV remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either Gardnerella or Mobiluncus. Use of a FemExam system (Cooper Surgical, Shelton, CT), based upon elevated pH and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the Gram stain method. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with BV but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14. These studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for BV. If such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginitis: general overview].
AB  - Bacteria are the most frequently detected agents in women, clinically complaining of vaginal discharge. The studies have shown that the vaginal microflora of women with bacterial vaginitis have altered from Lactobacillus spp. to various anaerobic bacteria. Gardnerella vaginalis is found in vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginitis as well as in healthy women, while anaerobic bacteria such as Mobiluncus and Prevotella are the causative agents for bacterial vaginosis. For the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial vaginitis, direct microscopy is one of the most commonly used methods, and for this purpose cervicovaginal smears are examined by staining Papanicolaou and Gram stains. Because of the demonstration of bacterial vaginitis in association with the obstetric diseases such as preterm labor and postpartum endometritis, is a risk factor, its importance has increased recently. In this review article, the microorganisms that cause bacterial vaginitis, their biological characteristics, and the diagnostic laboratory methods of infection, have been discussed.
TI  - Improving Gram-stained reproducible result by further adding clue cells in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The reproducibility of interpretation in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis may be enhanced by adding pus cells and clue cells into two different criteria, developed by Spiegel et al. and Nugent et al. The purpose of study was designed to find out which parameter was more reproducible. 100 patients were collected with the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis as an experimental group, while the other 100 patients who were with routine Papanicolaou smears in gynecologic clinic the collected as a control group. Two slides, including the original and reproducible ones, were obtained from vaginal smears for each patient. Three technicians read the slides randomly by using two different criteria, plus pus cells and clue cells. This showed the agreement for clue cells is the best method regardless of experimental group or control group (Kappa values between 0.708 and 1.000). The intra-observer agreement for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by the method of Nugent et al. is superior to the method of Spiegel et al. Our data show the comparison of Amsel criteria versus Nugent criteria for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with sensitivity of 88.9%, specificity of 55.4%, negative positive value of 62.1%, and positive predictive value of 85.8%. Moreover, our data also demonstrate the comparison of Amsel criteria versus the diagnosis either based on Nugent criteria or the presence of clue cells with sensitivity of 95.7%, specificity of 56.7%, negative positive value of 81.2%, and positive predictive value of 87.1%. The results demonstrate further adding score of the clue cells can enhance the reproducible diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, which is superior to the methods of Nugent et al. and Spiegel et al.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis among a group of married Jordanian women: occurrence and laboratory diagnosis.
AB  - A total of 310 vaginal swabs collected from a group of married Jordanian women complaining of vaginal discharge were examined for bacterial vaginosis. The scoring system of Nugent for the interpretation of Gram staining was employed. This system revealed the presence of the condition in 29.7% of patients. Results obtained using the scoring system correlated significantly with the detection of clue cells and the scarcity of white blood cells in the vaginal discharge. An inverse relationship was found between bacterial vaginosis and Lactobacillus morphotypes determined by Gram staining. No definite relationship was detected between bacterial vaginosis and the recovery of Gardnerella vaginalis by culture as this organism was isolated from swabs which according to the Nugent criterion were negative for bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis among the women investigated was more prevalent than vaginitis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis or yeasts.
TI  - The diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and vaginal flora changes.
AB  - In a population of 956 women, attending for contraceptive advice, 131 (13.7%) were found to have BV acording to Amsel's criteria. Clue cells were detected in 200 (20.9%) women, a positive amine ('sniff') test in 191 (20.0%), a vaginal pH > or = 4.7 in 243 (25.4%) and a "characteristic" vaginal discharge in 104 (10.9%) women. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values in relation to BV were calculated for each of these four criteria. The detection of clue cells, an increased pH and a positive sniff test showed excellent sensitivity (86-100%) values, but had a less satisfactory positive predictive value (52-68%). Vaginal discharge was found to be a poor predictor of BV. The vaginal flora in women with clue cells, increased vaginal pH or a positive sniff test was very similar to that of the women with BV, every after excluding concomitant cases of BV and the three respective criteria. Thus, a positive amine test, which is easily performed, strongly suggests BV and a vaginal flora predominated by Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Mobiluncus species and anaerobic species on one hand, and lack of lactobacilli on the other. When there is a clinical suspicion of BV, the sniff test is positive and differential diagnoses are excluded, one can safely treat a woman for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Inhibition of chemotaxis by organic acids from anaerobes may prevent a purulent response in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - It has been postulated that certain organic acids produced by the anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) could prevent a purulent response in this infection. Varying concentrations of pure succinic, acetic and lactic acids were incubated in vitro with a monocytic cell line (MonoMac 6). High inhibition of chemotaxis was produced by succinic acid; lower inhibition and no inhibition was shown by acetic acid and lactic acid respectively. Succinic and acetic acids were detected in high concentrations in the vaginal fluid of women with BV and in culture supernates of Prevotella and Mobiluncus spp.; these acids impaired chemotaxis of MonoMac 6 cells in vitro. The vaginal fluids of normal women and the culture supernates of Lactobacillus spp. had no effect on chemotaxis.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis a "broad overview".
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was first reported in 1995 by Gardner and Dukes, who described the unique clinical signs and symptoms and the distinctive nature of the vaginal discharge associated with it. They also described a "new" causative organism, which they named "Haemophilus vaginalis", subsequently renamed Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is currently the most prevalent cause of infectious vaginitis among women attending for genitourinary diseases. BV has a complex microbiology. Lactobacillus populations, which are usually dominant in healthy women, are replaced by a polymicrobial group of organisms that includes G. vaginalis, anaerobic Gram-negative rods such as Prevotella species, Peptostreptococcus species, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and often Mobiluncus species. Anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes, aminopeptidases, that degrade protein and decarboxylases that convert amino acids and other compounds to amines. Those amines contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with the syndrome, raising the vaginal pH and producing a discharge odor. The excessive amounts of bacteria characteristic of the syndrome attach to epithelial cell surfaces, resulting in "clue cell". Nearly half the patients report no noticeable symptoms, but many develop a characteristic copious, malodorous discharge if untreated. Results from epidemiologic studies have associated BV with serious upper genital tract infections and adverse pregnancy outcome. In particular, the presence of BV in pregnant women increases the risk of preterm delivery, and evidence is now compelling that BV is a cause of preterm delivery. The interest in potential invasiveness of G. vaginalis has increased. However, virulence determinants have not been studied enough. The most important therapy includes clindamycin and metronidazole.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: association with adverse pregnancy outcome.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is the most common lower genital tract infection encountered  among women of reproductive age. This condition can best be considered as a vaginal syndrome associated with an alteration of the normal vaginal flora rather than an infection specific to any one microorganism. Bacterial vaginosis is a clinical condition with a complex microbiology that is characterized by a reduced concentration of a normally abundant Lactobacillus species along with high concentrations of gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, particularly, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Mycoplasma species. The exact make up of the microorganisms and their relative concentration vary among women who have this condition. Although it was previously regarded as a harmless condition, recent work has linked bacterial vaginosis to numerous upper genital tract complications such as preterm labor and preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis, and postpartum endometritis. The findings from recent prospective randomized trials suggest that treatment of bacterial vaginosis in certain women who are at high risk for preterm delivery decreases the rate of preterm birth.
TI  - Vaginal microflora associated with bacterial vaginosis in Japanese and Thai pregnant women.
AB  - The vaginal flora of 118 Japanese and 208 Thai pregnant women were investigated for the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV), BV-associated organisms, and BV-associated enzyme. A similar prevalence of BV was found among the Japanese (13.6%) and Thai women (15.9%). The microbial flora of women with BV were complex; the mean number of isolates recovered in the BV group was approximately 2 times more than that in a group of healthy women. Prevotella species, Porphyromonas species, Peptostreptococcus species, Mobiluncus species, Gardnerella vaginalis, and H2O2-nonproducing lactobacilli were significantly associated with BV. These organisms were less associated with H2O2-producing lactobacilli, which were predominant in women with normal flora, suggesting that H2O2-producing lactobacilli have antibacterial activity against BV-associated organisms. The vaginal sialidase assay by means of a filter-paper spot test was not proved to be a useful screening aid for diagnosis of BV because of the low sensitivity (69.4%) of this test.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: prevalence in an Italian population of asymptomatic pregnant women and diagnostic aspects.
AB  - The present study has been carried out with the main objective of determining the prevalence rate of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in a population of asymptomatic pregnant women (8th to 9th month of pregnancy). Out of a total 1,441 patients examined BV was found to be present in 70 (4.9%). The diagnosis was made when an analysis of the vaginal discharge revealed the simultaneous presence of at least three out of four of the following laboratory indices: (1) direct Gram stain positive (bacterial flora mixed with Gram-negative coccobacilli and variable-gram predominant over the lactobacillus flora); (2) pH > 4.5; (3) positive odour test with KOH 10%; (4) presence of clue cells. After a discussion of the principal laboratory and clinical signs presently used for the diagnosis of BV, the authors suggest the exclusion of the evaluation of the appearance of the vaginal discharge from the standard diagnostic criteria. Further, three diagnostic methods are hypothesized for use in different settings.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: drugs versus alternative treatment.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is one of the most common infectious disorders affecting women. It is caused by several microorganisms, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, beta-streptococci and mobiluncus/falcivibrio sp. Bacterial vaginosis is thought to occur as a result of a change in vaginal pH mediated by the metabolic activity of anaerobic bacteria. This rise in vaginal pH interferes with the activity of vaginal lactobacilli which maintain vaginal acidity. Several types of antibiotics have been used to treat this condition. Although metronidazole was found to be the most effective, none was completely successful in either cure or prevention. Several attempts have recently been made to treat bacterial vaginosis using physiological or 'natural' substances, such as lactate gel and commercial yoghurt, which is acidic and also contains lactobacillus strains. This kind of treatment looks promising and may have a place in certain clinical conditions, including pregnancy, in cases of recurrent inflammation, or as a prophylactic treatment before invasive gynecological procedures or abdominal surgery in patients known to be affected. This issue should be additionally studied and evaluated in light of the relatively little experience with this modality of treatment for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Evaluation of the Etest for antimicrobial spectrum and potency determinations of  anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis and peritonitis.
AB  - One hundred ninety-seven anaerobic organisms (24 Gardnerella vaginalis, 16 Mobiluncus spp., 19 Peptostreptococcus spp., 20 Lactobacillus spp., 20 Prevotella bivia/disiens, 81 Bacteroides fragilis group, 12 Clostridium spp., and five Fusobacterium spp.) were processed by the Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) and a reference (Brucella blood agar) method against 10 antimicrobial agents. For the bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens, the Etest was more reproducible and correlated acceptably with the reference agar test: within +/- 1 log2 dilution for 74.4% of Mobiluncus spp. to 96.0% for Peptostreptococcus spp. (all organisms, 83.4%). The quantitative correlation +/- 2 log2 dilution steps between test results was 94.3%. Results with B. fragilis group strains demonstrated 97.3% correlation (+/- 2 log2 dilution) with a trend toward slightly lower Etest minimum inhibitory concentrations for ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotaxime, imipenem, and clindamycin. The absolute qualitative interpretive agreement between Etest and the reference agar dilution method results was 94.4%, with only a 0.4% false-susceptible error rate. The Etest appears to be a very practical, quantitatively accurate, alternative procedure for clinical microbiology laboratories routinely testing the susceptibilities of anaerobes and, by these presented data, organisms associated with female tract infections.
TI  - Effects of Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on the adherence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, and Lactobacillus acidophilus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A decreased concentration or total disappearance of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the vagina constitutes a frequent observation in bacterial vaginosis. GOAL OF THE STUDY: Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate has been evaluated in vitro to detect antiadhesive properties at subinhibitory concentrations for Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus curtisii to vaginal epithelial cells (VEC). STUDY DESIGN: Bacterial strains 14C- and or 3H-labeled were tested for adherence and competition to binding sites in VECs before and after treatment at sub-MIC with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. RESULTS: In control tests of adherence, G. vaginalis and M. curtisii had their maximal adhesion at pH 5.4, L. acidophilus at pH 4.4. Preincubation of G. vaginalis and M. curtisii with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate 2.5 mg/mL (subinhibitory concentration) at pH 5.4 reduced adherence to VECs respectively by 48.3% and 34.1%. The same treatment of L. acidophilus showed no statistically significant difference. Treatment of VECs alone did not modify adherence. Competition tests between L. acidophilus and G. vaginalis and between L. acidophilus and M. curtisii showed that, in small quantities, L. acidophilus could compete with G. vaginalis and M. curtisii for binding sites in VECs at pH 4.4, when pretreated with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. At a higher pH (4.8 and 5.4), L. acidophilus in higher quantities did not compete for binding sites occupied by G. vaginalis and M. curtisii. CONCLUSIONS: Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at subinhibitory concentrations modifies the adhesiveness of G. vaginalis and M. curtisii to VECs, reducing it by 48.3% and 34.1%, respectively. Adhesion of L. acidophilus to VECs is not impaired by pretreatment with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at pH 4.4, even if they are in low number and compete for binding sites against pathogens. At higher pH levels, L. acidophilus did not compete for binding sites occupied by G. vaginalis and M. curtisii.
TI  - A quantitative microbiological study of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - A quantitative microbial study of vaginal secretions from 100 women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and 50 healthy women matched for age, was undertaken. This was aimed at comparing the bacterial flora colonising the vagina of sexually active asymptomatic women with those with BV and correlating bacterial counts with presence of symptoms. Of the total 475 bacteria isolated anaerobes were predominant among controls and among patients aerobes and anaerobes had equal prevalences. The increased viable counts of all anaerobes (> 10(7) cfu/g) were related with symptoms. Mobiluncus mulieris could be isolated from one patient and Chlamydia trachomatis antigen was absent in all samples tested. Bacteroides, G. vaginalis and Ureaplasma urealyticum were found to be the most commonly occurring group in women with BV. Lactobacillus, and probably Coryneforms have a protective role in health, preventing disease.
TI  - [Value of the score for Gram strains in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - The interpretation of Gram-stained slides of vaginal swab specimens is evaluated  for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and correlated with the isolation bacteria and clinical signs: thin homogeneous vaginal discharge, pH > or = 4.7, amine odor and presence of clue cells. Gram stained smears were scored following a morphotype classification: (a)-Lactobacillus morphotypes (scored 4 to 0), (b)-small Gram negative (G. vaginalis, scored 0 to 4), (c)-curved Gram variable rods (Mobiluncus morphotypes, scored 0 to 2). The scoring system (0 to 10) was a weighted combination of these morphotypes: a+b+c. The criterion for bacterial vaginosis was a score > or = 7, a score of 0 to 6 was considered as no bacterial vaginosis. Samples of 709 women, aged 18 to 84 (mean age = 39.7) were examined. The prevalence of G. vaginalis culture was 12.5%, and Mobiluncus infection occurred in 1.5%. The frequency of M. hominis was diagnosed in 2.8% of women. A score of 7 to 10 on Gram stain was observed in 9.7% in the population. Compared to G. vaginalis culture, Gram stained smear was more sensitive (0.71) than clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis (0.46). The specificity was similar with the two methods. The assessment of G. vaginalis morphotypes was highly correlated with the G. vaginalis culture (p < 0.001, OR = 248). The infection of T. vaginalis or Candida sp. was never associated with a score > or = 7. The Gram-stained smear is a cheap, fast and easy method. It provides good results for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis and vaginal microorganisms in idiopathic premature labor and  association with pregnancy outcome.
AB  - The vaginal microflora of 49 women in idiopathic preterm labor was compared with  that of 38 term controls to determine whether the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and/or specific microorganisms would influence the rate of preterm delivery. Demographic factors, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive history were also studied. BV, as defined by the presence of clue cells in a vaginal wet mount and characteristic microbial findings in a stained vaginal smear and vaginal culture, was more common in women with preterm labor and delivery than in controls (P < 0.01). The condition, diagnosed in 41% of women who had both preterm labor and delivery (n = 22) and in 11% each of women who had preterm labor but term delivery (n = 27) and controls, was associated with a 2.1-fold risk (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 3.7) for preterm birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation. BV was associated with low birth weight. Of 49 women with preterm labor, 67% (8 of 12) of women with BV were delivered of low-birth-weight neonates (< 2,500 g) compared with 22% (8 of 37) of women without the condition (P < 0.0005). The presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing facultative Lactobacillus spp. was strongly negatively associated with both preterm delivery and BV. BV-associated microorganisms, i.e., Mobiluncus, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus species, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mycoplasma hominis, and high numbers of Gardnerella vaginalis were significantly associated with preterm delivery; all species also strongly associated with BV (P = 0.0001 for each comparison). Mobiluncus curtisii and Fusobacterium nucleatum were recovered exclusively from women with preterm delivery. Our study clearly indicates that BV and its associated organisms are correlated with idiopathic premature delivery.
TI  - Diagnostic microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized microbiologically by replacement of the Lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora by Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides species, Mobiluncus species, and genital mycoplasmas. A standardized, laboratory-based diagnostic test for bacterial vaginosis is desirable in those instances in which a microscope is unavailable in the clinic or when the evaluator of the wet mount examination is inexperienced at recognizing clue cells. Vaginal cultures have excellent sensitivity for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, but because the predictive value of a positive G. vaginalis culture is less than 50%, cultures are not recommended. Vaginal Gram smears are objective and reproducible, have 62% to 100% sensitivity, and have a positive predictive value of 76% to 100%. Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with use of Papanicolaou-stained smears has been reported, but standardized criteria have not been widely adopted. A rapid, office-based oligonucleotide probe test for high concentrations of G. vaginalis has been developed and may be useful when direct microscopy is unavailable or confidence in microscopic examination is low. Laboratory tests that detect microbial products unique to the vaginal fluid of women with bacterial vaginosis include detection of amines (putrescine, cadaverine, and trimethylamine), measurement of the relative levels of succinate and lactate in the vaginal fluid by gas chromatography, detection of proline aminopeptidase by colorimetric assay, or detection of sialidases in the vaginal fluid. Although these tests are not yet applicable to routine use, these research tests could be adapted for wider use in office laboratories. Vaginal Gram stains are more useful than culture for laboratory confirmation of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - The microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - A group of microorganisms are present concurrently in high concentrations in the  vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis. The major members of the group are Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera Prevotella, Porphyromonas and Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus species, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and often Mobiluncus species. Facultative species of Lactobacillus are present in lower concentrations and are less prevalent in bacterial vaginosis than in women with a normal vaginal examination. The exact microbe(s) responsible for bacterial vaginosis is unknown whether among the organisms listed above or an unknown agent. The high concentrations of anaerobic gram-negative rods, peptostreptococci, and other opportunistic pathogens in the lower genital tract place women with bacterial vaginosis at increased risk for genital infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of tioconazole and its concentrations in vaginal  fluids following topical (vagistat-1 6.5%) application.
AB  - In vitro assays demonstrated that clinical yeasts were significantly more inhibited by tioconazole (MIC50, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) than by fluconazole (MIC50, 8 micrograms/ml). Tioconazole also exhibited high potency against most molds (Alterneria spp. and Acremonium spp.). All Candida tropicalis isolates had MICs of 8 micrograms/ml, four-fold greater than any other Candida spp. Generally Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible to tioconazole. Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) was the most susceptible Gram-negative species. Staphylococci and enterococci were the most susceptible to tioconazole Gram-positive species (MIC50s, 1-8 micrograms/ml). Bacterial species associated with vaginosis. [Gardnerella vaginalis (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Mobiluncus spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) and Prevotella biviadisiens (MIC90, 64 micrograms/ml)] were inhibited by tioconazole. Isolates of Lactobacillus spp. were most resistant (MIC90, > or = 256 micrograms/ml) to tioconazole. Vaginal fluid levels of tioconazole (mean, 91.4 micrograms/ml) persisted above the MIC90 levels (1-64 micrograms/ml) for most fungal and bacterial pathogens for 72 h in 19 evaluable female human subjects receiving 300 mg tioconazole in an intravaginal ointment.
TI  - The normal vaginal flora, H2O2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  - In this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (Lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (BV) on the basis of a vaginal smear. BV was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. H2O2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with BV, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and 61% of those with a normal flora. H2O2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. The microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with BV included Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia/disiens, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Prevotella corporis/Bacteroides levii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mobiluncus species, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus tetradius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma hominis (P < .05 for each). The presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by H2O2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were B. ureolyticus, F. nucleatum, and P. prevotii. Other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without BV. We conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with BV in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with BV and those inhibited by H2O2-producing lactobacilli.
TI  - Comparative susceptibility of the Bacteroides fragilis group species and other anaerobic bacteria to meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin, cefoxitin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and metronidazole.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin, cefoxitin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and metronidazole was determined against 395 strains of strict and facultative anaerobes, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp. and Mobiluncus spp. The activities of meropenem and imipenem were within one dilution of their MIC50 and MIC90 values. One isolate of Bacteroides fragilis, two of Bacteroides distasonis, and two of Bacteroides ovatus showed resistance or diminished susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem. Metronidazole was active against almost all obligate anaerobic isolates. Some non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacilli and lactobacilli were resistant. Ampicillin/sulbactam inhibited almost all isolates at < or = 16/8 mg/L. The activity of clindamycin and cefoxitin was relatively good, but some strains of non-fragilis B. fragilis group species were resistant. Piperacillin was the least active agent tested.
TI  - [Recent bacteriologic data: from physiopathology to treatment].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a change in the vaginal ecosystem in which Lactobacillus spp, the dominant members of the normal flora, are replaced by an association of various bacterial species including Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes (Bacteroides spp, Prevotella spp, Porphyromonas spp, Peptostreptococcus spp and Mobiluncus spp) and Mycoplasma hominis. The reasons for this imbalance are unknown, although the loss of lactobacilli that produce hydrogen peroxide (which is toxic for G. vaginalis and numerous anaerobes) may be an essential element. The introduction of one or several of these species into the vagina (they can occasionally be isolated in small numbers even in the absence of vaginosis) following intercourse or from the intestinal tract may also play a role. G. vaginalis itself is not considered to cause vaginosis, but is almost always present and multiplies rapidly; in addition, it has a high capacity for adherence to epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. It is now agreed that the concomitant growth of one or several anaerobic species is required for bacterial vaginosis to develop. Our knowledge of the bacteriology of bacterial vaginosis has implications for diagnosis and treatment. It is now possible to obtain a precise bacteriologic diagnosis, not by culturing G. vaginalis (a costly and low-yield procedure), but by direct examination of the vaginal flora after Gram staining, which shows the replacement of lactobacilli by a characteristic polymorphic flora. Therapy is based on the use of antibiotics such as the imidazoles, which are active against G. vaginalis and anaerobes, but not against the commensal lactobacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  - Rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. High concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. Like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against Staphylococcus spp. (MIC50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), Streptococcus spp. (MIC50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC50, 0.06 microgram/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 0.25 microgram/ml). Rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting Bacteroides bivius-disiens, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., and Mobiluncus spp. strains (all MICs < or = 1 microgram/ml). Strains of Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. However, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were rifaximin resistant, for example, Candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to rifamycin resistance.
TI  - Antibiosis between bacteria isolated from the vagina of women with and without signs of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Lactobacilli from women with and without bacterial vaginosis (BV) were tested for H2O2 production. Thirty-seven (79%) of the 47 strains of lactobacilli isolated from the women without BV produced H2O2, while only nine (23%) of the 39 strains of lactobacilli obtained from women with BV did so. Five of 20 H2O2-producing and two of 26 non-producing strains of Lactobacillus exhibited antibiosis against four of 12 strains of peptostreptococci and two of 10 strains of Mobiluncus spp. None of a further 41 different anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial strains were inhibited by any of the isolates of lactobacilli tested. Some strains of Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteriodes spp., Mobiluncus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. inhibited the growth of three strains of lactobacilli belonging to different species. When the pH of the culture medium was increased from 6.0 to 6.5 this led to a decrease in the number of strains inhibited and/or the size of the growth-inhibitory zones. Different concentrations of H2O2 did not inhibit any of the strains tested. The growth-inhibitory effect of lactobacilli could not be related to their bacteriocin production. Increasing the iron content of the medium by adding FeCl3 (0.01 mM-1 mM) decreased or completely abolished the antibiosis.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginosis associated with Mobiluncus species in general practice].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a common disease in outpatient gynaecological practice. Mobiluncus is one of the bacterial species recently described as associated with bacterial vaginosis. In our study, bacterial vaginosis and Mobiluncus sp. morphotype were identified by means of a Gram-stained smear of the vaginal secretions. 40 women with Mobiluncus sp. associated bacterial vaginosis were treated with 500 mg metronidazole three times daily for seven days. 38 (95%) of the 40 patients showed no signs or symptoms of bacterial vaginosis after treatment, and the Mobiluncus sp. morphotype was absent from the Gram-stained smears in all 38 women. At the second control visit one month later, the Gram-stain was normal and no complaints of discharge were noted. The treatment had a favourable effect on the following signs and symptoms of bacterial vaginosis: homogeneous discharge, spotting/postcoital/intermenstrual bleeding, low abdominal pain, pH greater than 4.7. The reduction of these symptoms was statistically significant. The treatment reduced the presence of Mobiluncus, G vaginalis and led to the restoration of Lactobacillus flora. Mobiluncus associated bacterial vaginosis can be treated successfully with 500 mg of metronidazole three times a day for seven days.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - In the western world, bacterial vaginosis is now being recognised as the commonest cause of vaginitis. Bacterial vaginosis represents a major disturbance in vaginal microbiology with the massive overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic bacteria normally found in the vagina. Accordingly, high population levels of non-fragilis Bacteroides sp., peptostreptococci, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus sp. are found, with a corresponding decline in Lactobacillus sp. Excessive polyamine production by anaerobes is responsible for the offensive vaginal discharge, and G. Vaginalis adherent to epithelial cells produces pathognomonic clue cells, which together with elevated vaginal pH constitute the hallmark of diagnosis. The pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood and the role of sexual transmission is controversial. Bacterial vaginosis may cause symptoms but is frequently asymptomatic. It is more than a nuisance vaginal infection in that (a) many patients have recurrent episodes, and (b) it has recently been associated with post-partum and post-operative fever, upper genital tract infection, amnionitis and prematurity. Therapy for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis is currently dominated by metronidazole; however, clindamycin and a host of new agents may enjoy similar success. Women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis constitute a major therapeutic problem, as do pregnant women. The cause of frequently recurring bacterial vaginosis remains obscure. New data are presented here indicating that early recurrences are due to relapse and not reinfection. No evidence has emerged that suggests that relapse is due to antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  - Bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. We obtained semen samples from 37 men attending a Special Infertility Clinic and assessed the relationship between seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. One hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. The microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), Peptostreptococcus sp (62%), Bacteroides sp (27%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), Lactobacillus sp (16%), Actinomyces sp (16%), Enterococcus (11%), and Veillonella (11%). Other microorganisms including group B streptococcus, Hemophilus, Escherichia coli, Mobiluncus, and Clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. When the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), Bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or Peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (P greater than .05 for each comparison). The proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Cervico-vaginal pathogens and contraception: microbiological observations].
AB  - The authors relate the results about 172 vaginal and cervical swabs, in women with or without oral/local (IUD) contraception, with or without vaginosis/vaginitis. Gardnerella vaginalis was always prevalent; the authors observed an high correlation between cervical IUD and vaginal Gardnerella, more than IUD and cervical Chlamydia trachomatis. Bacterial associations in Gardnerella vaginalis (Mobiluncus, obligate anaerobes) are related; incidence of Candida and Trichomonas vaginalis are reported; correlation between these microbial agents and contraception are discussed.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli inhibiting growth of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus and other bacterial species cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - On a solid agar medium the growth-inhibitory effect of 9 Lactobacillus strains cultured from vaginal content was tested on bacteria cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis: Mobiluncus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides and anaerobic cocci. Inhibition zones were observed in the growth of all of the strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis around all lactobacilli. The inhibitory effect of the lactobacilli was further tested on various anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic species, both type strains and fresh extragenitally cultured strains. Four Bacteroides fragilis strains as well as 2 out of 4 Staphylococcus aureus strains were clearly inhibited by the lactobacilli. The inhibition zones were generally wider at pH 5.5 than at 6.0. For all inhibited strains, (the S. aureus excepted) a low pH on the agar around the lactobacilli correlated to wider growth-inhibition zones.
