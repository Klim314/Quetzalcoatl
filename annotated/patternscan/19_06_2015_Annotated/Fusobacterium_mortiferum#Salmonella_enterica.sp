TI  == a fusobacterium mortiferum strain produces a bacteriocin-like substance(s) inhibiting salmonella enteritidis.
AB  == seven strictly anaerobic strains showing anti-salmonella enteritidis activity were isolated from poultry caecal contents. among them, the most inhibitory one,  a strain of fusobacterium mortiferum, called fm1025, was selected. biochemical tests, showing the proteinaceous structure of the antagonist(s) produced, indicated that the strain fus. mortiferum fm1025 synthesized (a) bacteriocin-like compound(s) active against salm. enteritidis. among the other strains tested, both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were inhibited. these preliminary results suggested the important role of the fusobacterium strains against pathogenic bacteria among the intestinal flora.

TI  == bacteroidaceae in thromboembolic disease: effects of cell wall components on blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro.
AB  == the effects of bacteroides sp., fusobacterium mortiferum, bacteroides fragilis, and sphaerophorus necrophorus on various parameters of blood coagulation in vivo  and in vitro were determined and compared to the coagulation effects of escherichia coli and salmonella minnesota, wild type and r595. intravenous injection of washed cells, culture filtrate, lipopolysaccharide, or lipid a of the anaerobic gram-negative microorganisms into mice resulted in acceleration of  coagulation. lipopolysaccharide and lipid a of the anaerobic microorganisms had no apparent effect on circulating platelets in mice or rabbits and did not cause  aggregation of human platelets in vitro. washed cells, lipopolysaccharide, and lipid a of bacteroides sp. and f. mortiferum also significantly accelerated the clotting time of recalcified platelet poor normal human plasma and c6-deficient rabbit plasma. lipid a, but not lipopolysaccharide, of e. coli and washed cells of s. minnesota r595 accelerated coagulation by a similar mechanism. these results indicated that bacteroides sp. and f. mortiferum can accelerate blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism which does not involve platelets  or terminal components of complement.
