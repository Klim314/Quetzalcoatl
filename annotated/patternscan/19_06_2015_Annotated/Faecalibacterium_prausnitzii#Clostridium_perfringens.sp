TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == a gene-targeted approach to investigate the intestinal butyrate-producing bacterial community.
AB  == background: butyrate, which is produced by the human microbiome, is essential for a well-functioning colon. bacteria that produce butyrate are phylogenetically diverse, which hinders their accurate detection based on conventional phylogenetic markers. as a result, reliable information on this important bacterial group is often lacking in microbiome research. results: in this study we describe a gene-targeted approach for 454 pyrotag sequencing and quantitative  polymerase chain reaction for the final genes in the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). we monitored the establishment and early succession of butyrate-producing communities in four patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent a colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis and compared it with three control samples from healthy colons. all patients established an abundant butyrate-producing community (approximately 5% to 26% of the total community) in  the pouch within the 2-month study, but patterns were distinctive among individuals. only one patient harbored a community profile similar to the healthy controls, in which there was a predominance of but genes that are similar to reference genes from acidaminococcus sp., eubacterium sp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii and roseburia sp., and an almost complete absence of buk genes. two patients were greatly enriched in buk genes similar to those of clostridium butyricum and c. perfringens, whereas a fourth patient displayed abundant communities containing both genes. most butyrate producers identified in previous studies were detected and the general patterns of taxa found were supported by 16s rrna gene pyrotag analysis, but the gene-targeted approach provided more detail about the potential butyrate-producing members of the community. conclusions: the presented approach provides quantitative and genotypic insights  into butyrate-producing communities and facilitates a more specific functional characterization of the intestinal microbiome. furthermore, our analysis refines  but and buk reference annotations found in central databases.

TI  == arabinogalactan and fructo-oligosaccharides have a different fermentation profile in the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (shime (r)).
AB  == current prebiotics, such as fructo-oligosaccharides (fos), are limited in their persistence in the distal colon and are predominantly fermented in the proximal colon. in order to identify a potential alternative, the differences in the fermentation profile of arabinogalactan (ag) and fos have been assessed in the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem. the effect of each product on the composition and activity of the microbial community was analysed during a  3-week treatment period at a dose of 5 g day(-1). while fos indeed was mainly fermented in the simulated proximal colon, ag was still available for fermentation in the simulated distal colon as shown by ph profiles, size exclusion chromatography and analyses of specific enzymatic activities. as a consequence, the main effect of the products (increase in propionate and butyrate and decrease in ammonium production) occurred in different intestinal areas. dgge and qpcr analyses confirmed that the main modulation of the microbiota by the two products occurred in different areas of the gut. ag was associated with a statistically significant increase in the concentration of total bacteria, bacteroidetes, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a delayed bifidogenic effect and a decrease of the pathogenic clostridium perfringens. fos led to a strong lactobacillogenic effect.

TI  == sensitivity of pathogenic and commensal bacteria from the human colon to essential oils.
AB  == the microbiota of the intestinal tract plays an important role in colonic health, mediating many effects of dietary components on colonic health and during enteric infections. in the context of the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance in gut bacteria, complementary therapies are required for the prevention and treatment of enteric infections. here we report the potential application of essential oils (eo) and pure eo compounds to improve human gut health. nerolidol, thymol, eugenol and geraniol inhibited growth of the pathogens escherichia coli o157 : h7(vt(-)), clostridium difficile dsm1296, clostridium perfringens dsm11780, salmonella typhimurium 3530 and salmonella enteritidis s1400 at a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) varying from 50 to 500 p.p.m. most eo showed greater toxicity to pathogens than to commensals. however, the beneficial commensal faecalibacterium prausnitzii was sensitive to eo at similar  or even lower concentrations than the pathogens. the eo showed dose-dependent effects on cell integrity, as measured using propidium iodide, of gram-positive bacteria. these effects were not strongly correlated with growth inhibition, however, suggesting that cell membrane damage occurred but was not the primary cause of growth inhibition. growth inhibition of gram-negative bacteria, in contrast, occurred mostly without cell integrity loss. principal component analysis showed clustering of responses according to bacterial species rather than to the identity of the eo, with the exception that responses to thymol and nerolidol clustered away from the other eo. in conclusion, the selective effects  of some eo might have beneficial effects on gut health if chosen carefully for effectiveness against different species.

TI  == intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis b virus infection. intestinal microbiota of hbv cirrhotic patients.
AB  == to unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis b virus (hbv), chronic hepatitis b, decompensated hbv cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative pcr and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens in fecal crude dna and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. data analysis indicated that 16s rrna gene copy numbers for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of hbv cirrhotic patients. the bifidobacteria/enterobacteriaceae (b/e) ratio, which may  indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis b to  0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated hbv cirrhosis (for all, p < 0.01). this suggests that b/e ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. the data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. fecal secretory iga and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated hbv cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.

TI  == prebiotic effect of fruit and vegetable shots containing jerusalem artichoke inulin: a human intervention study.
AB  == the present study aimed to determine the prebiotic effect of fruit and vegetable  shots containing inulin derived from jerusalem artichoke (ja). a three-arm parallel, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was carried out with sixty-six healthy human volunteers (thirty-three men and thirty-three women, age range: 18-50 years). subjects were randomised into three groups (n 22) assigned to consume either the test shots, pear-carrot-sea buckthorn (pcs) or plum-pear-beetroot (ppb), containing ja inulin (5 g/d) or the placebo. fluorescent in situ hybridisation was used to monitor populations of total bacteria, bacteroides, bifidobacteria, clostridium perfringens/histolyticum subgroup, eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group, lactobacillus/enterococcus spp., atopobium spp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii and propionibacteria. bifidobacteria levels were significantly higher on consumption  of both the pcs and ppb shots (10.0 (sd 0.24) and 9.8 (sd 0.22) log10 cells/g faeces, respectively) compared with placebo (9.3 (sd 0.42) log10 cells/g faeces)  (p < 0.0001). a small though significant increase in lactobacillus/enterococcus group was also observed for both the pcs and ppb shots (8.3 (sd 0.49) and 8.3 (sd 0.36) log10 cells/g faeces, respectively) compared with placebo (8.1 (sd 0.37) log10 cells/g faeces) (p = 0.042). other bacterial groups and faecal scfa concentrations remained unaffected. no extremities were seen in the adverse events, medication or bowel habits. a slight significant increase in flatulence was reported in the subjects consuming the pcs and ppb shots compared with placebo, but overall flatulence levels remained mild. a very high level of compliance (>90 %) to the product was observed. the present study confirms the prebiotic efficacy of fruit and vegetable shots containing ja inulin.

TI  == characterization of cecal microbiota and response to an orally administered lactobacillus probiotic strain in the broiler chicken.
AB  == a probiotic lactobacillus strain was given in drinking water to young broiler chickens from 1 to 19 days of age. cecal contents were collected from 4- and 19-day-old chickens in treated and control groups. enumeration of bacteria by culture on selective media showed a decrease in clostridium perfringens carriage  in the 4-day-old treated chickens, whereas coliforms and lactobacillus populations were not significantly affected by the treatment. fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis with 7 phylogenetic probes targeting the major groups of intestinal bacteria revealed that the clostridium coccoides group accounted for more than 50% of the total bacteria in the cecum of 4-day-old chickens, whereas the bacterial community of 19-day-old chickens evolved towards a more diverse microbiota with faecalibacterium prausnitzii (36%) and c. coccoides (22%) groups  representing the predominant bacteria. no effect of the lactobacillus strain supplementation was observed in the composition of the cecal microbiota assessed  by fluorescent in situ hybridization with the 7 probes. nevertheless, profiling of the cecal microbiota using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with principal component analysis demonstrated an impact of the probiotic treatment on the overall bacterial community as well as on the lactobacillus population.

TI  == quantitative analysis of the intestinal bacterial community in one- to three-week-old commercially reared broiler chickens fed conventional or antibiotic-free vegetable-based diets.
AB  == aims: to explore the effect of drug-free poultry production on the intestinal microflora of broiler chickens, the bacterial community of this environment was quantitatively profiled in both conventionally reared birds and birds reared without antibiotic growth promotants (agps) on a vegetable-based diet. methods and results: quantitative, real-time pcr with group-specific 16s rdna primer sets was used to enumerate the abundance of the following chicken gastrointestinal (gi) tract phylogenetic groups: the clostridium leptum-faecalibacterium prausnitzii subgroup (clostridium genus cluster iv), the clostridium coccoides -  eubacterium rectale subgroup (clostridium cluster xiva and xivb), the bacteroides group (including prevotella and porphyromonas), bifidobacterium spp., the enterobacteriaceae, the lactobacillus group (including the genera leuconostoc, pediococcus, aerococcus and weissella), the clostridium perfringens subgroup (clostridium cluster i), enterococcus spp., veillonella spp., atopobium spp., campylobacter spp. and the domain bacteria. a species-specific 5'-nuclease (taqman) assay was also employed to specifically assess cl. perfringens abundance. ten birds were sampled from each of two commercial chicken houses, one in which feed was supplemented with agps and exogenous animal protein, and the other vegetable-based and drug-free, at 7, 14 and 21 days of age. the ileal community was dominated by two large populations, the lactobacilli and the enterobacteriaceae, with those taxa much more numerous in drug-free vegetable-based diet fed birds than those conventionally reared at the 7- and 14-day time periods. the progressive changes in microflora in both the conventional and drug-free caeca were similar to each other, with the enterobacteriaceae sequences dominating at day 7, but being replaced by obligate  anaerobe signature sequences by day 14. of note was the finding that all the day  14 and day 21 replicate caecal samples from the drug-free house were positive for campylobacter spp. averaging >10(8) 16s rdna gene copies per gram wet weight. conclusions: quantitative, real-time pcr indicates that the effects of drug-free  rearing on the chicken gi tract microbial community are most pronounced in the ileal region, but agps may be important in controlling campylobacter colonization of the caecum. significance and impact of the study: a quantitative taxonomic understanding of the shifting microbial ecology of the broiler chicken gut microbiota is important in the light of agp withdrawal. agp withdrawal has occurred in response to concerns over the transfer of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to humans via the food production chain.

TI  == microbial community composition of the ileum and cecum of broiler chickens as revealed by molecular and culture-based techniques.
AB  == the microbial communities of the ileum and cecum of broiler chickens from a conventional and an organic farm were investigated using conventional culture techniques as well as cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. eighty-five percent of the 557 cloned sequences were <97% related to known cultured species.  the chicken ileum was dominated by lactobacilli, whereas the cecum harbored a more diverse microbial community. the cecum was dominated by a large group of bacteria with hitherto no close cultured relatives but most closely related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii. approximately 49 and 20% of the cecal clones belonged to this cluster in conventional and organic broiler chickens, respectively. we were, however, able to recover a number of these phylotypes by cultivation, and the isolates were shown to be butyric acid producers. the investigation was a descriptive rather than a comparative study of 2 different rearing systems; however, several differences were observed. for instance, clostridium perfringens was found in significantly higher numbers in the birds from the organic farm compared with the conventional broilers, probably due to the addition of salinomycin to the conventional feed. in the ileum, the abundance of the different lactobacillus species differed between the 2 broiler types. the  culture-based and culture-independent techniques complemented each other well. strengths and limitations of the different methods are discussed.
