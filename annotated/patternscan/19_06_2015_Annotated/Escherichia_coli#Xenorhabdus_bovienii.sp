TI  == [an idp16 protein from xenorhabdus bovienii depresses the immune response in galleria mellonella].
AB  == objective: a protein with insect immunodepressive activity was purified from xenorhabdus bovienii, a bacterial symbiosis of entomopathogenic nematode. to determine the function of this protein in the pathogenesis of bacterium-nematode  symbiosis, we detected the effect of this protein on immune response in galleria  mellonella. methods: proteins from extracellular extact of x. bovienii were purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, hitrap q hp chromatography, hitrap butyl ff chromatography, and hitrap sp hp chromatography. intra-hemocoel injection assay followed by observation of hemolymph melanization was used for activity determination. fluorescent microspheres and sepharose beads were used to assess the effect of purified protein on phagocytosis and encapsulation of hemocytes, respectively. the purified protein was identified by 2-d and ms anlysis. the full-length encoding gene was cloned by pcr, and expressed with pet  30a in escherichia coli. the recombinant protein was purified by ni-nta affinity  chromatography. results: an immunodepressive protein was purified and designed as idp16, which can inhibit the phenoloxidase activity, and weaken the phagocytosis  and encapsulation of galleria mellonella hemocytes. the encoding gene was then cloned and expressed in e. coli. the recombinant protein was also determined to be immunodepressive. conclusion: the idp16 protein from xenorhabdus bovienii can  depress the immune response in insect, which may play an important role in bacteria-host interaction.

TI  == xenorhabdus bovienii t228 phase variation and virulence are independent of reca function.
AB  == colony pleomorphism, or phase variation, expressed by entomopathogenic bacteria belonging to the genus xenorhabdus, is an important factor which determines the association of the bacteria with their nematode symbiont and the outcome of infection of susceptible insect larvae by the bacterium- nematode parasitic complex. the mechanism underlying phase variation is unknown. to determine whether reca-mediated processes are linked to phase variation, the reca gene of xenorhabdus bovienii was cloned and sequenced. when expressed in a reca-deleted strain of escherichia coli, the x. bovienii reca clone was able to complement the loss of reca function. x. bovienii chromosomal reca insertion mutants showed increased sensitivity to uv. phase 1 forms did not show altered ability to convert to phase 2 and no significant differences in expression of other phase-dependent characteristics, including phospholipase c, haemolysin, protease, antibiotic activity and congo red binding, were noted. furthermore, the ld(50) of the x. bovienii reca insertion mutant for galleria mellonella larvae was not significantly different from that of wild-type strains. from these data the authors conclude that reca is unlikely to be involved in phase variation, the expression of phase-dependent characteristics, or virulence factors involved in killing of susceptible larvae.
