TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == identification of streptomyces sp. kh29, which produces an antibiotic substance processing an inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the actinomycete strain kh29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. based on the diaminopimelic acid (dap) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (sem), kh29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus  streptomyces. by way of its noted 16s rdna nucleotide sequences, kh29 was found to have a relationship with streptomyces cinnamonensis. the production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (py) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees c. the antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including ms and nmr as a cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). cyclo(l-trp-l-trp), from the py cultures of kh29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant acinetobacter baumannii. furthermore, cyclo(ltrp- l-trp) had antimicrobial activity against bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergillus  niger, and candida albicans, however, it was ineffective against streptomyces murinus.

TI  == [screening and function analysis of a cyclohexanone-degrading bacterium cn1 from  deep sea sediment].
AB  == micrococcu luteus cn1 was found to be able to utilize cyclohexanone well from the strains originally isolated from pacific ocean sediment. the optimum conditions for its growth were determined as 25 degrees c -37 degrees c, ph 8, salinity 6%.  it could survive in the medium with high concentration of cyclohexanone ( > 44% v/v), and grew most vigorously in medium with 16.7% (v/v) cyclohexanone. cn1 could transform cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone which could be further degraded and mineralized quickly. this indicated the presence of cyclohexanol dehydrogenase and probable presence of cyclohexanone monooxygenase. with degenerate pcr for cloning part of cyclohexanone monooxygenase gene, the dna fragment of 450bp was gotten. amino acid sequence analysis showed that it owned the conserved sequence  of the baeyer-villiger monooxygenase family and had the highest homology of 80% with cyclohexanone monooxygenase from arthrobacter sp. bp2, only 53% with that from acinetobacter sp. ncimb 9871 which had been the most deeply investigated. so far as we know, both cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone degradation resorted to cyclohexanone monooxygenase. so this gene should be responsible for cyclohexanone degradation in cn1. all the cyclohexanone-degraders previously reported could degrade cyclopentanone, but, cn1 did not degrade cyclopentanone. this indicated that cyclohexanone monooxygenase in cn1 was special. additionally, it was found for the first time that cyclohexanol could inhibit cyclohexanone degradation to certain degree in cn1.

TI  == [value of the technique of cellular lysis by thermic shock in the isolation of bacteria causing osteoarticular infections].
AB  == the purpose of this work is to compare, a conventional technique, for bacterial isolation, with a lysis-centrifugation method using a rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen, followed by decongelation at 37 degrees c for bone and joint samples. the bone and joint specimens were biopsies and punctions (35 cases) or fistula (10 cases). the residual antibiotic activity of the sample was determined using a susceptible strain of micrococcus luteus and of staphylococcus epidermidis. among the 45 samples, 20 were sterile with both methods among which 8 exhibited a residual antibiotic activity which may have contributed to isolation failure. in  12 cases, bacterial isolates were obtained with both methods. cultures were obtained from 13 samples with the lysis centrifugation method alone. the isolates were 4 staphylococcus aureus, 8 coagulase-negative staphylococcus and 1 acinetobacter sp. these results suggest that the intracellular location of bacteria may be responsible for the negative cultures from bone or joint specimens.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
