TI  == haemophilus species
AB  == the genus haemophilus includes a number of species that cause a wide variety of infections but share a common morphology and a requirement for blood-derived factors during growth that has given the genus its name. haemophilus influenzae,  the major pathogen, can be separated into encapsulated or typable strains, of which there are seven types (a through f including e') based on the antigenic structure of the capsular polysaccharide, and unencapsulated or nontypable strains. type b h influenzae is by far the most virulent organism in this group,  commonly causing bloodstream invasion and meningitis in children younger than 2 years. nontypable strains are frequent causes of respiratory tract disease in infants, children, and adults. other haemophilus species cause disease less frequently. haemophilus parainfluenzae sometimes causes pneumonia or bacterial endocarditis. haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid. haemophilus aphrophilus is a  member of the normal flora of the mouth and occasionally causes bacterial endocarditis. haemophilus aegyptius, which causes conjunctivitis and brazilian purpuric fever, and haemophilus haemolyticus used to be separated on the basis of their ability to agglutinate or lyse red blood cells, but both are now included among the nontypable h influenzae strains.

TI  == structural basis of heme binding in the cu,zn superoxide dismutase from haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == the cu,zn superoxide dismutase from haemophilus ducreyi is characterized by the unique ability to bind heme at its dimer interface. here we report the high-resolution crystal structures of this protein in the heme-loaded (holo) and  heme-free (apo) forms. heme is asymmetrically bound between the two enzyme subunits, where heme iron is coordinated by two histidine residues, his64 and his 124, provided by the two subunits. moreover, the binding of heme to the protein is ensured by stabilizing contacts between the prosthetic group and a limited number of other residues, most of which are not present in other bacterial enzyme variants. we show that the introduction of only three mutations at the dimer interface of the enzyme from haemophilus parainfluenzae, a closely related bacterial species, is sufficient to induce heme-binding ability by this enzyme variant. heme binding does not alter protein activity. moreover, the binding of the prosthetic group does not induce any significant structural perturbation at the subunit level and requires only limited local structural rearrangements that  widen the cleft at the dimer interface and cause a limited shift in the relative  orientation between the subunits. the presence of a preformed heme-binding pocket and the significant solvent exposure of the cofactor to the solvent are compatible with the suggested protective role of the enzyme against heme toxicity or with its involvement in heme trafficking in the periplasmic space.

TI  == a histidine-rich metal binding domain at the n terminus of cu,zn-superoxide dismutases from pathogenic bacteria: a novel strategy for metal chaperoning.
AB  == a group of cu,zn-superoxide dismutases from pathogenic bacteria is characterized  by histidine-rich n-terminal extensions that are in a highly exposed and mobile conformation. this feature allows these proteins to be readily purified in a single step by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. the cu,zn-superoxide dismutases from both haemophilus ducreyi and haemophilus parainfluenzae display anomalous absorption spectra in the visible region due to copper binding at the n-terminal region. reconstitution experiments of copper-free enzymes demonstrate  that, under conditions of limited copper availability, this metal ion is initially bound at the n-terminal region and subsequently transferred to an active site. evidence is provided for intermolecular pathways of copper transfer  from the n-terminal domain of an enzyme subunit to an active site located on a distinct dimeric molecule. incubation with edta rapidly removes copper bound at the n terminus but is much less effective on the copper ion bound at the active site. this indicates that metal binding by the n-terminal histidines is kinetically favored, but the catalytic site binds copper with higher affinity. we suggest that the histidine-rich n-terminal region constitutes a metal binding domain involved in metal uptake under conditions of metal starvation in vivo. particular biological importance for this domain is inferred by the observation that its presence enhances the protection offered by periplasmic cu,zn-superoxide dismutase toward phagocytic killing.

TI  == a novel heme protein, the cu,zn-superoxide dismutase from haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of the genital ulcerative disease known  as chancroid, is unable to synthesize heme, which it acquires from humans, its only known host. here we provide evidence that the periplasmic cu,zn-superoxide dismutase from this organism is a heme-binding protein, unlike all the other known cu,zn-superoxide dismutases from bacterial and eukaryotic species. when the h. ducreyi enzyme was expressed in escherichia coli cells grown in standard lb medium, it contained only limited amounts of heme covalently bound to the polypeptide but was able efficiently to bind exogenously added hemin. resonance raman and electronic spectra at neutral ph indicate that h. ducreyi cu,zn-superoxide dismutase contains a 6-coordinated low spin heme, with two histidines as the most likely axial ligands. by site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of a structural model of the enzyme, we identified as a putative axial ligand a histidine residue (his-64) that is present only in the h. ducreyi enzyme and that was located at the bottom of the dimer interface. the introduction of a  histidine residue in the corresponding position of the cu,zn-superoxide dismutase from haemophilus parainfluenzae was not sufficient to confer the ability to bind  heme, indicating that other residues neighboring his-64 are involved in the formation of the heme-binding pocket. our results suggest that periplasmic cu,zn-superoxide dismutase plays a role in heme metabolism of h. ducreyi and provide further evidence for the structural flexibility of bacterial enzymes of this class.

TI  == distribution of diaminopropane, putrescine and cadaverine in haemophilus and actinobacillus.
AB  == cellular levels of diaminopropane, putrescine and cadaverine, and decarboxylase activities to produce these diamines in six species (16 strains) of haemophilus and four species (5 strains) of actinobacillus belonging to the family pasteurellaceae of the gamma subclass of the class proteobacteria, were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). diaminopropane was ubiquitously distributed within all haemophilus and actinobacillus species, and l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid decarboxylase activity was detected in them. putrescine and ornithine decarboxylase activity were found in h. aphrophilus, h. parainfluenzae and h. influenzae (type a, b, d, e and f except for type c) but not detected in h. aegyptius, h. parahaemolyticus, h. ducreyi and actinobacillus  species. cadaverine occurred in h. aphrophilus, h. aegyptius, h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. equuli and a. lignieresii, whereas their lysine decarboxylase activity was scarcely detected. cadaverine was not found in h. parahaemolyticus, h. ducreyi and a. suis. the diamine profile serves  as a phenotypic marker for the chemotaxonomic classification of the family pasteurellaceae.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of a 16s/23s ribosomal spacer from haemophilus parainfluenzae reveals an invariant, mosaic-like organisation of sequence blocks.
AB  == a 16s/23s ribosomal spacer from a haemophilus parainfluenzae rrn locus was cloned and sequenced. analysis of pcr-amplified genomic fragments showed that this region is strongly conserved among unrelated isolates; computer analysis of database homologies showed that the spacer consists of sequence blocks, arranged  in a mosaic-like structure, with strong homologies with analogous blocks present  in the spacer regions of haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus ducreyi and actinobacillus spp. it also contains a trna(glu) gene, which is highly homologous to trna(glu) genes found in spacers of other species. these data strongly support the hypothesis that recombination events are involved in the organisation of the  sequence of the spacer, as a result of horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the cu,zn-superoxide dismutase of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == the sodc gene of haemophilus ducreyi was cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino  acid sequence of this protein exhibited 71.6% identity and 81.8% similarity to the h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae copper (cu), zinc (zn)-superoxide dismutase (sod) enzymes. this gene was localized to a 2.2-kb h. ducreyi chromosomal dna insert in plasmid phdsod. sod activity was expressed in cell-free extracts of escherichia coli containing the recombinant plasmid phdsod and was localized to the periplasmic space. the cu,zn-sod produced by the h. ducreyi sodc gene did not complement the aerobic growth defect of an e. coli sod-deficient mutant.

TI  == growth characteristics of v factor-independent transformants of haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae is a v factor-dependent species. a plasmid conferring v factor independence in haemophilus parainfluenzae and haemophilus ducreyi was transferred to plasmid-free h. influenzae rd by dna transformation. the growth characteristics of the transformants in a complex and a chemically defined medium were compared, and the ability of several exogenous pyridine nucleotides and precursors to support growth was examined. although the transformants appeared to be v factor independent in a complex medium, in a chemically defined medium they  exhibited both v factor-dependent and nicotinamide-dependent growth. because of the inability of the plasmid-free h. influenzae rd to utilize nicotinamide for growth, it was concluded that the genes conferring this function were plasmid linked. our results indicate that the v factor requirement, as it is presently defined, is not suitable to serve as a definitive taxonomic criterion for species determination in the family pasteurellaceae.

TI  == identification of highly conserved and species-specific polypeptides of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == chancroid is a sexually transmitted diseased caused by haemophilus ducreyi. the pathological manifestations of chancroid are unique among haemophilus species and the virulence factors of h. ducreyi that account for these features have not been identified. some of these virulence factors may be unique components of h. ducreyi, but attempts to identify h. ducreyi-specific components have been unsuccessful. four polypeptides--a, b, c and d of 83, 77, 56 and 28 kda, respectively--were identified with a panel of nine h. ducreyi-specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs). polypeptide c was one of the five major proteins in h. ducreyi and demonstrated micro-heterogeneity in sds-page. polypeptides a, b and d were present in only small amounts in whole-cell lysates of h. ducreyi. the relative amounts of a and b varied, suggesting that they may be precursor molecules. the unique polypeptides c and d were not exposed on the surface. polypeptide c was highly soluble and did not appear to be membrane-bound, whereas polypeptide d appeared to partition with the cytoplasmic membrane and was soluble in sarkosyl.  all four polypeptides appeared to be unique to h. ducreyi since mabs directed against them did not cross-react with h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae or neisseria gonorrhoeae. the mol. wts of all of these polypeptides were conserved throughout 35 clinical isolates collected from 15 cities in eight countries and one reference strain of h. ducreyi that were tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == use of an adsorption enzyme immunoassay to evaluate the haemophilus ducreyi specific and cross-reactive humoral immune response of humans.
AB  == serodiagnosis of chancroid is limited by the cross-reactivity of haemophilus ducreyi with haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae. this research describes an adsorption enzyme immunoassay (eia) that assesses the humoral immune response of north americans and africans to h. ducreyi. adsorption effectively removed anti-h. influenzae and anti-h. parainfluenzae antibodies, revealing that  north american control sera had no residual anti-h. ducreyi reactivity. however,  african control sera still had a residual anti-h. ducreyi response. assessment of the duration of the humoral immune response in sera from african patients with chancroid showed that the humoral antibodies persisted for up to 8 months after the diagnosis. this may explain the lack of specificity of the adsorption eia in  areas where chancroid is endemic. the detection of the humoral immune response was affected by the strain of h. ducreyi used, with indigent strains being most useful. using h. ducreyi 35000 for canadian sera, the sensitivity of the adsorption eia was 100% and the specificity was 88%. for african sera, h. ducreyi strain r018 was used, and the adsorption eia had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of only 23%. these data reveal that the existing humoral response in  a country where chancroid is endemic differs from that in a country where it is not, and that care must be used interpreting unadsorbed humoral immune responses. the adsorption eia approach may prove useful as an epidemiologic tool for definition of existing (past and present) levels of exposure to h. ducreyi.

TI  == phylogeny of 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae as determined by comparison of 16s rrna sequences.
AB  == virtually complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae. of these strains, 15 were pasteurella, 16 were actinobacillus, and 23 were haemophilus. a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequence similarity, using the neighbor-joining method.  fifty-three of the strains fell within four large clusters. the first cluster included the type strains of haemophilus influenzae, h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. haemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus, h. segnis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. this cluster also contained a. actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, atcc 29522, atcc 29523, and atcc 29524 and h. aphrophilus nctc 7901. the second cluster included the type strains of a. seminis and pasteurella aerogenes  and h. somnus ovcg 43826. the third cluster was composed of the type strains of pasteurella multocida, p. anatis, p. avium, p. canis, p. dagmatis, p. gallinarum, p. langaa, p. stomatis, p. volantium, h. haemoglobinophilus, h. parasuis, h. paracuniculus, h. paragallinarum, and a. capsulatus. this cluster also contained  pasteurella species a ccug 18782, pasteurella species b ccug 19974, haemophilus taxon c capm 5111, h. parasuis type 5 nagasaki, p. volantium (h. parainfluenzae)  nctc 4101, and p. trehalosi nctc 10624. the fourth cluster included the type strains of actinobacillus lignieresii, a. equuli, a. pleuropneumoniae, a. suis, a. ureae, h. parahaemolyticus, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. ducreyi, and p. haemolytica. this cluster also contained actinobacillus species strain ccug 19799 (bisgaard taxon 11), a. suis atcc 15557, h. ducreyi atcc 27722  and hd 35000, haemophilus minor group strain 202, and h. parainfluenzae atcc 29242. the type strain of p. pneumotropica branched alone to form a fifth group.  the branching of the pasteurellaceae family tree was quite complex. the four major clusters contained multiple subclusters. the clusters contained both rapidly and slowly evolving strains (indicated by differing numbers of base changes incorporated into the 16s rrna sequence relative to outgroup organisms).  while the results presented a clear picture of the phylogenetic relationships, the complexity of the branching will make division of the family into genera a difficult and somewhat subjective task. we do not suggest any taxonomic changes at this time.

TI  == antigenic diversity in haemophilus ducreyi as shown by western blot (immunoblot)  analysis.
AB  == the antigenic diversity within a panel of 63 haemophilus ducreyi isolates was examined by western blot (immunoblot) analysis with a pool of 238 well-characterized human antisera. when a serum pool adsorbed on a mixture of haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and h. parahaemolyticus was used, the  immunoprofiles suggested that prominent antigenic proteins involved in the human  immune response have apparent molecular masses of 63, 42, 34 to 30, and 28.5 to 28 kda. preliminary subcellular localization revealed that these antigens are associated with the cellular membrane. two subsets of antigens were discriminated by detergent extraction. there was no evidence that the antigen composition is altered by changing the growth conditions. with a serum pool adsorbed on the haemophilus spp. mixture supplemented with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  pasteurella ureae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and escherichia coli, antigenic determinants more specific for h. ducreyi were identified. an immunodominant 28.5- to 28-kda protein was expressed by all h. ducreyi isolates. in the range from 34 to 30 kda, 56 isolates revealed a dominant protein with variable molecular mass. by using both proteins (28.5 to 28 kda and 34 to 30 kda) as immunotypic markers, seven different immunopatterns were identified. antigenic diversity among isolates from different geographical origins as well as from a single area was observed.

TI  == distribution of protein d, an immunoglobulin d-binding protein, in haemophilus strains.
AB  == protein d, a novel surface protein of the bacterial species haemophilus influenzae with specific affinity for human immunoglobulin (ig) d was detected in all 127 h. influenzae strains studied. all strains representing different serotypes of encapsulated strains and different biotypes of nonencapsulated strains bound 125i-labeled igd to a high degree (38 to 74%). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot (immunoblot) analysis showed that protein d from all h. influenzae strains had the same apparent molecular weight (i.e., 42,000) and reacted with all three different anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies. by scatchard analysis, the number of protein d residues  on a nontypeable h. influenzae strain was estimated to be approximately 2,800 per organism. the equilibrium constant for the reaction between a human igd myeloma protein and igd was found to be 5.8 x 10(8) m-1. also, all strains of h. haemolyticus and h. aegypticus strains tested bound igd, 21 to 28% and 41 to 48%, respectively. in extracts of those bacteria, a 42,000-molecular-weight protein reactive with igd and all three anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies was found. in h. parainfluenzae, h. aphrophilus, h. paraphrophilus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a 42,000-molecular-weight protein that was reactive with one to three of three anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies but not reactive with  human igd was detected with western blot analysis. other haemophilus species (h.  ducreyi, h. parasuis, h. parahaemolyticus, h. segnis, and h. haemoglobinophilus)  did not react with human monoclonal igd or anti-protein d antibodies. on the basis of the wide distribution of protein d among h. influenzae strains, we suggest that protein d could be a vaccine candidate.

TI  == production of monoclonal antibodies specific for haemophilus ducreyi: a screening method to discriminate specific and cross-reacting antibodies.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi is the etiological agent of chancroid. the organism shares extensive immunological cross-reactivity with other haemophilus species. this presents substantial difficulties for the production of specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs). a competition elisa was devised for hybridoma screening which  allowed the detection of h. ducreyi-specific antibody-producing hybridoma cultures during the initial screening process. with this screening method, seven  mabs specific for h. ducreyi were obtained in a single cell fusion exercise. the  specificities of the 7 mabs were demonstrated by direct elisa and dot immunobinding assays against several strains each of h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. five of the mabs reacted against all ten strains of h. ducreyi. these mabs may permit the development of rapid and efficient immunodiagnostics for chancroid. the principle of the competition elisa for hybridoma screening should be widely applicable to the development of specific mabs to other organisms in which immunological cross-reactivity is an impediment to hybridoma screening by conventional methods.

TI  == origin of small beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids in haemophilus species and neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == fifty-nine percent of unselected strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae were found to carry small, phenotypically cryptic plasmid dna species. using filter blot hybridization, we found several plasmids which were homologous to the small beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids pjb1 and pfa7, which were originally isolated  from haemophilus ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. detailed filter hybridization studies combined with electron microscope heteroduplex analysis suggested that three cryptic plasmids are completely homologous to the non-tna sequences of pjb1. one cryptic plasmid was found to be highly homologous to pjb603, a small beta-lactamase plasmid previously found in two isolates of h. influenzae. a second group of plasmids were found to carry sequences homologous to pjb1 and other sequences homologous to pjb603. these results strongly suggest  that small beta-lactamase plasmids found in haemophilus species and n. gonorrhoeae may have arisen by insertion of the transposable beta-lactamase-specifying element tna into small, phenotypically cryptic replicons resident in h. parainfluenzae. attempts to reproduce such a recombination event in the laboratory were not successful.

TI  == use of dot-immunobinding and immunofluorescence assays to investigate clinically  suspected cases of chancroid.
AB  == in 1984 and 1985, outbreaks of genital ulcers occurred in florida and new york. initial investigations for syphilis, herpes simplex, chlamydia trachomatis, and haemophilus ducreyi did not implicate any of these organisms as etiologic agents. from the results of dot-immunobinding assays, we found that sera from the patients had higher levels of igm (30 [47.6%] of 63 patients) and igg (22 [34.9%] of 63 patients) reactivities with an outer-membrane preparation from h. ducreyi strain cip542 than with outer-membrane preparations from haemophilus influenzae atcc 10211 or haemophilus parainfluenzae atcc 7901. in contrast, sera from 35 patients in the control group did not react with any of the outer-membrane preparations (p less than .01 for both igm and and igg reactivity), nor did sera  from eight individuals with disease caused by h. influenzae (p = .051 for igm reactivity, p = .02 for igg reactivity). indirect immunofluorescence assay using  a monoclonal antibody reactive with outer-membrane preparations from h. ducreyi strain cip542 stained organisms in smears of lesion material from genital ulcers  from three of six patients. these results suggested that the cause of both outbreaks of genital ulcers was h. ducreyi which was subsequently isolated in both geographic areas.

TI  == evolution of antibiotic resistance plasmids in neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus species.
AB  == the emergence of beta-lactamase producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae has required fundamental changes in the antimicrobial therapy of disease caused by these organisms. ampicillin resistance in both organisms is caused by plasmid mediated production of tem beta-lactamase. this enzyme is specified by a sequence of mol. wt 3.2 x 10(6) which is capable of inserting itself at multiple sites in dna replicons without the requirement for significant base sequence homology between donor and recipient replicon. further, it does so without requirement for conventional recombination enzymes. analysis of beta-lactamase specifying plasmids of h. influenzae show that they generally have a molecular mass in the order of 30 x 10(6) and contain the complete tna sequence. they are conjugative but are incapable of mobilizing smaller beta-lactamase plasmids. previous studies have presented evidence suggesting that these plasmids may have evolved by insertion of the tna sequence (perhaps introduced from enteric bacteria) into a phenotypically cryptic plasmid of mol. wt 27 x 10(6) resident in rare strains of h. influenzae. in this study, we review data showing a high degree of homology between the small (3--7 x 10(6) mol. wt),  nonconjugative beta-lactamase specifying plasmids of n. gonorrhoeae, h. parainfluenzae and h. ducreyl and present new evidence that cryptic plasmids highly homologous to the beta-lactamase plasmids are present in many strains of h. parainfluenzae. this suggests that the small beta-lactamase specifying plasmids of h. parainfluenzae, h. ducreyi and n. gonorrhoeae may have arisen by insertion of tna into phenotypically cryptic plasmids present in h. parainfluenzae.

TI  == haemophilus influenzae: comparison of respiratory tract isolates with genitourinary tract isolates.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae isolates recovered from the genitourinary (gu) tract were  shown to have a significantly different biotype distribution compared with respiratory tract isolates. biotype iv strains were recovered more commonly from  the gu tract, and most strains were non-serotypable. antibiotic-susceptible strains isolated from the gu tract more frequently harbored plasmids of less than 10 megadaltons than did antibiotic-susceptible respiratory tract strains. one 2.8-megadalton plasmid resident in a gu tract isolate and one 1.8-megadalton plasmid resident in a respiratory tract isolate were shown to be related to the small ampicillin resistance plasmids previously described in h. influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, haemophilus ducreyi, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. this  supports the suggestion that these ampicillin resistance plasmids originated by transposition or recombination of the ampicillin transposon (tna) with cryptic endogenous haemophilus plasmids.

TI  == molecular nature of a plasmid specifying beta-lactamase production in haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == we characterized pjb1, the plasmid previously reported to mediate beta-lactamase  production in haemophilus ducreyi. we studied its relationship to pmr0360 and rsf0885, the plasmids responsible for beta-lactamase production in neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus parainfluenzae, respectively. although pjb1 was maintained as a multicopy pool in escherichia coli, it was not stably maintained  in the absence of antibiotic selection. electron microscope heteroduplex studies  showed that it carried 100% of the transposable ampicillin resistance sequence tna. this sequence was transposed to plasmid pub307 at a low rate. heteroduplexes between pmr0360 and pjb1 showed that they contained 3.3 megadaltons of homologous sequences. two sets of nonhomologous sequences, one a tna sequence and the other  a non-tna sequence, took the form of insertion loops. for plasmids pmr0360 and rsf0885, previously shown to be highly related, the nonhomologous sequences took  the form of a substitution loop. we concluded that all three plasmids shared major portions of their sequences but differed in discrete segments. pjb1 was the first such plasmid to have a physically and functionally intact tna sequence.

AB  == the fatty acid composition of 35 haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-oh-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. the three c18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. this general pattern was also found for most of the other species of haemophilus examined (h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. canis, h. gallinarum, h. haemolyticus, and h. parainfluenzae). small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for h. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus and h. suis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from h. influenzae. pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely  related to that of haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the c18 fatty acids. the fatty acid pattern of h. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. this species lacked 3-oh-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.

TI  == a taxonomic study of the genus haemophilus, with the proposal of a new species.
AB  == a collection of 426 haemophilus strains isolated from people with infectious diseases and from the normal flora of mucous membranes in humans and various animal species was studied in an attempt to revise and improve the taxonomy of the genus haemophilus. the examinations included the determination of a number of biochemical and physiological properties, of which several had not previously been applied to the taxonomy of haemophili. the resulting data reavealed many hitherto unrecognized characters of taxonomic significance and several of the species can now be more accurately defined. the classification presented is supported by the dna base composition of a large number of representative strains. a diagnostic key to the different taxa is presented. haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae have been subdivided into a number of biotypes.  it is possible to demonstrate a relationship between the individual biotypes of h. influenzae and the origin of the strains assigned to them. the results indicate that h. aegyptius, h. parahaemolyticus and h. paraphrohaemolyticus do not merit specific status. four unnamed taxa of v-factor-dependent haemophili have been recognized. the name haemophilus segnis is proposed for one of these taxa, which consists mainly of strains isolated from the human oral cavity. it is demonstrated that the name h. ducreyi has been used for different groups of bacteria, and that only one of these groups can legitimately be assigned to the genus haemophilus. haemolytic v-factor-dependent strains from swine, previously included in h. parahaemolyticus, are significantly different from strains of human origin and should be named h. pleuropneumoniae. none of the strains from swine and fowls were haemin-dependent. the relationships of these strains to the  species h. suis and h. gallinarum, and to h. parasuis and h. paragallinarum are discussed. haemophilus piscium is shown not to belong to the genus haemophilus. the taxonomic position of h. aphrophilus is uncertain and its possible relationship to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans requires further study. the  positive correlation found between the ecology of the strains studied and their affiliation with the different taxa is discussed.
