TI  - Study of Lactic Acid Bacteria Community From Raw Milk of Iranian One Humped Camel and Evaluation of Their Probiotic Properties.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Camel milk is amongst valuable food sources in Iran. On the other hand, due to the presence of probiotic bacteria and bacteriocin producers in camel milk, probiotic bacteria can be isolated and identified from this food product. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present research were the isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria from camel milk and evaluation of their probiotic properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of ten samples of camel milk were collected from the Golestan province of Iran under aseptic conditions. Bacteria were isolated by culturing the samples on selective medium. Isolates were identified by amplification of the 16S rDNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and were then screened and grouped by the Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) method. To evaluate probiotic properties, representative isolates of different ARDRA profiles were analyzed. The antimicrobial activity of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) against Pediococcus pentosaceus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus was examined by the agar diffusion assay. Acid and bile tolerance of isolates were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 64 isolates were analyzed based on biochemical tests and morphological characteristics. The most frequently isolated LAB was Enterococci. Weissella, Leuconostoc, Lactobacilli and Pediococci were less frequently found. Based on restriction analysis of the ITS, the isolates were grouped into nine different ARDRA patterns that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as P. pentosaceus, Enterococcus faecium strain Y-2, E. faecium strain JZ1-1, E. faecium strain E6, E. durans, E. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus casei and Weissella cibaria. The results showed that antimicrobial activity of the tested isolates was remarkable and P. pentosaceus showed the most antibacterial activity. In addition, E. durans, E. lactis, L. casei and P. pentosaceus were selected as probiotic bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the presence of bacteriocin-producing bacteria and probiotic bacteria in camel milk from the Golestan province of Iran.
TI  - Construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pJY33 from Weissella cibaria 33.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid, pJY33, from Weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pJY33 was  2365 bp in size with a GC content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (ORFs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from W. cibaria KLC140. A Weissella-Escherichia coli shuttle vector, pJY33E (6.5 kb, Em(r)), was constructed by ligation of pJY33 with pBluescript II SK(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (Em(r)). pJY33E replicated in Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Weissella confusa. A single-stranded DNA intermediate was detected from Lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pJY33E, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pJY33. Most Lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pJY33E after one week of daily culturing in MRS broth without Em. An aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-Gal) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in Lb. brevis 2.14 using pJY33E, and the highest level of alpha-Gal activity (36.13 U/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.
TI  - Multistep synthesis of UDP-glucose using tailored, permeabilized cells of E. coli.
AB  - We constructed and applied a recombinant, permeabilized Escherichia coli strain for the multistep synthesis of UDP-glucose. Sucrose phosphorylase (E.C. 2.4.1.7) of Leuconostoc mesenteroides was over expressed and the pgm gene encoding for phosphoglucomutase (E.C. 5.4.2.2) was deleted in E. coli to yield the E. coli JW 0675-1 SP strain. The cells were permeabilized with the detergent Triton X-100 at 0.05 % v/v. The synthesis of UDP-glucose with permeabilized cells was then optimized with regard to pH, cell density during the synthesis and growth phase during cell harvest, metal cofactor, other media components, and temperature. In one configuration sucrose, phosphate, UMP, and ATP were used as substrates. At pH 7.8, 27 mg/ml cell dry weight, cell harvest during the early stationary phase of growth and Mn(2+) as cofactor a yield of 37 % with respect to UMP was achieved at 33 degrees C. In a second step, ATP was regenerated by feeding glucose and using only catalytic amounts of ATP and NAD(+). A UDP-glucose yield of 60 % with respect to UMP was obtained using this setup. With the same setup but without addition of external ATP, the yield was 54%.
TI  - The influence of the cell free solution of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food borne-pathogens in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  - The function of cell-free solutions (CFSs) of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (FBPs) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (TDB) using HPLC. Cell free solutions were prepared from four LAB strains. Two different concentrations which were 50% (5 ml CFS+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml CFS+7.5 ml medium/1:3) CFS and the control without CFS were prepared. Both concentration of CFS of Streptococcus thermophilus and 50% CFS of Pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by Salmonella paratyphi A. Tyramine production by Escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% CFS of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% CFS of Leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. The inhibitor effect of 50% CFS of P. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by Listeria monocytogenes, following Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% CFS of Leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). The stimulation effects of 50% CFS of S. thermophilus and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by Staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. CFS of LAB strains showed statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased pH quickly and reduced the formation of AMN and BAs. Consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use CFS for food and food products.
TI  - Metabolic impact of an NADH-producing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) is one of the major sources of NADPH when glucose is the sole carbon nutrient. However, unbalanced NADPH production causes growth impairment as observed in a strain lacking phosphoglucoisomerase (Deltapgi). In this work, we studied the metabolic response of this bacterium to the replacement of its glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) by an NADH-producing variant. The homologous enzyme from Leuconostoc mesenteroides was studied by molecular dynamics and site-directed mutagenesis to obtain the NAD-preferring LmG6PDH(R46E,Q47E). Through homologous recombination, the zwf loci (encoding G6PDH) in the chromosomes of WT and Deltapgi E. coli strains were replaced by DNA encoding LmG6PDH(R46E,Q47E). Contrary to some predictions performed with flux balance analysis, the replacements caused a substantial effect on the growth rates, increasing 59 % in the Deltapgi strain, while falling 44 % in the WT. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of the zwf locus showed that the expression level of the mutant enzyme was similar to the native enzyme and the expression of genes encoding key enzymes of the central pathways also showed moderate changes among the studied strains. The phenotypic and qPCR data were integrated into in silico modelling, showing an operative G6PDH flux contributing to the NADH pool. Our results indicated that, in vivo, the generation of NADH by G6PDH is beneficial or disadvantageous for growth depending on the operation of the upper Embden-Meyerhof pathway. Interestingly, a genomic database search suggested that in bacteria lacking phosphofructokinase, the G6PDHs tend to have similar preferences for NAD and NADP. The importance of the generation of NADPH in a pathway such as the oxPPP is discussed.
TI  - Designing of a novel dextransucrase efficient in acceptor reactions.
AB  - Dextransucrase is produced by Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus Species. The enzyme synthesizes dextran and acceptor products some of which act as prebiotics that are increasingly used in such industries as food, medicine, and cosmetics. B-512F Leuconostoc mesenteroides dextransucrase (DSR-S) is the preferred enzyme in commercial production of dextran and prebiotics. In the present work, a novel dextransucrase which is efficient in prebiotics production was designed. The enzyme was produced at optimal conditions in Escherichia coli by truncation and fusion to glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-512 FMC. The novel enzyme (MW: 119 kDa) was active and carried out dextran biosynthesis and acceptor reactions effectively. The novel dextransucrase (fTDSR-S) was produced by truncating signal, variable, and the glucan-binding regions in the gene and fusion of gst gene at the 5' end. fTDSR-S was characterized in detail and compared to the DSR-S. Truncation and fusion resulted in an increase in fTDSR-S biosynthesis in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by 35 fold. fTDSR-S leads to production of dextran as well as increased acceptor reactions. Due to GST fusion, it was possible to immobilize fTDSR-S covalently onto Eupergit C successfully. It was also found that the size of the active site of dextransucrase is 49 amino acids shorter than that reported previously in the literature.
TI  - Site directed immobilization of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase via thiol-disulfide interchange: influence on catalytic activity of cysteines introduced at different positions.
AB  - This study shows the effect of site-directed enzyme immobilization upon the enzyme activity of covalently bound glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Immobilization points were introduced at sterically accessible sites in order to control the protein's orientation and twice as much activity was recovered in comparison to conventionally immobilized enzyme. Immobilization of G6PDH via genetically engineered cysteine provided a simple, but effective method to control the immobilization process. G6PDH variants with cysteine close to the active center (L218C), close to the dimer interface (D205C) as well as far from the active center (D453C) showed changes in activity and the efficacy of immobilization.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a cryptic plasmid, pMBLR00, from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides KCTC 3733.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid, pMBLR00, from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides KCTC 3733 was isolated, characterized, and used for the construction of a cloning vector to engineer Leuconostoc species. pMBLR00 is a rolling circle replication plasmid, containing 3,370 base pairs. Sequence analysis revealed that pMBLR00 has 3 open reading frames: Cop (copy number control protein), Rep (replication protein), and Mob (mobilization protein). pMBLR00 replicates by rolling circle replication, which was confirmed by the presence of a conserved double-stranded origin and single-stranded DNA intermediates. An Escherichia coli-Leuconostoc shuttle vector, pMBLR02, was constructed and was able to replicate in Leuconostoc citreum 95. pMBLR02 could be a useful genetic tool for metabolic engineering and the genetic study of Leuconostoc species.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of active truncated dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-1299CB4.
AB  - The open reading frame of dsrE563, a dextransucrase gene obtained from a constitutive mutant (CB4-BF563) of Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-1299, consists of 8,511 bp encoding 2,836 amino acid residues. DsrE563 contains two catalytic domains (CD1 and CD2). Two truncated derivative mutants DsrE563DeltaCD2DeltaGBD (DsrE563-1) and DsrE563DeltaCD2DeltaVR (DsrE563-2) of DsrE563 were constructed and expressed using the pRSETC vector in Escherichia coli. The derivatives DsrE563-1 (deletion of 1,620 amino acids from the C-terminus) and DsrE563-2 (deletion of 1,258 amino acids from the C-terminus and 349 amino acids from the N-terminus) were expressed as active enzymes. Both enzymes synthesized less-soluble dextran, mainly containing alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkage. The synthesized less-soluble dextran also had a branched alpha-1,3 linkage. DsrE563-2 showed 4.5-fold higher dextransucrase activity than that of DsrE563-1 and showed higher acceptor reaction efficiency than that of dextransucrase from L. mesenteroides 512 FMCM when various mono or disaccharides were used as acceptors. Thus, the glucan-binding domain was important for both enzyme expression and dextransucrase activity.
TI  - Cell-mediated killing of Listeria monocytogenes by leucocin C producing Escherichia coli.
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen causing listeriosis. Listeria in foods can be inhibited with bacteriocins or bacteriocin producing cultures. The aim of this study was to enhance the killing of L. monocytogenes by binding bacteriocin producing Escherichia coli cells to Listeria cells. Antilisterial E. coli was obtained by transferring leucocin C production from Leuconostoc carnosum 4010. For binding of E. coli cells to Listeria cells, the Listeria phage endolysin PlyP35 cell wall binding domain (CBD) was displayed on E. coli cell surface as FliC::CBD chimeric protein in flagella. CBD insertion in flagella was confirmed by Western analysis and enterokinase cleavage. By mixing isolated flagella with L. monocytogenes WSLC 1019 cells, the FliC::CBD flagella was shown to bind to Listeria cells. However, the wild type flagella also attached to Listeria cells masking putative additional binding mediated by the CBD. Yet, the cell-mediated leucocin C killing resulted in two-log reduction of Listeria, whereas the corresponding amount of leucocin C in spent culture medium could only inhibit growth without bacteriocidal effect. Cells binding Listeria and secreting antilisterial peptides may have applications in protection against listeriosis as they kill Listeria better than free antilisterial peptides.
TI  - Use of a novel Escherichia coli-leuconostoc shuttle vector for metabolic engineering of Leuconostoc citreum to overproduce D-lactate.
AB  - Determination of the complete nucleotide sequence of a cryptic plasmid, pMBLT00,  from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides KCTC13302 revealed that it contains 20,721 bp, a G+C content of 38.7%, and 18 open reading frames. Comparative sequence and mung been nuclease analyses of pMBLT00 showed that pMBLT00 replicates via the theta replication mechanism. A new, stable Escherichia coli-Leuconostoc shuttle vector, pMBLT02, which was constructed from a theta-replicating pMBLT00 replicon and an erythromycin resistance gene of pE194, was successfully introduced into Leuconostoc, Lactococcus lactis, and Pediococcus. This shuttle vector was used to engineer Leuconostoc citreum 95 to overproduce d-lactate. The L. citreum 95 strain engineered using plasmid pMBLT02, which overexpresses d-lactate dehydrogenase, exhibited enhanced production of optically pure d-lactate (61 g/liter, which is 6 times greater than the amount produced by the control strain) when cultured in a reactor supplemented with 140 g/liter glucose. Therefore, the shuttle vector pMBLT02 can serve as a useful and stable plasmid vector for further development of a d-lactate overproduction system in other Leuconostoc strains and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Selection of potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria from fermented olives by in vitro tests.
AB  - The present study aims to evaluate the probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from naturally fermented olives and select candidates to be used as probiotic starters for the improvement of the traditional fermentation process and the production of newly added value functional foods. Seventy one (71) lactic acid bacterial strains (17 Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 1 Ln. pseudomesenteroides, 13 Lactobacillus plantarum, 37 Lb. pentosus, 1 Lb. paraplantarum, and 2 Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) isolated from table olives were screened for their probiotic potential. Lb. rhamnosus GG and Lb. casei Shirota were used as reference strains. The in vitro tests included survival in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, antimicrobial activity (against Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli O157:H7), Caco-2 surface adhesion, resistance to 9 antibiotics and haemolytic activity. Three (3) Lb. pentosus, 4 Lb. plantarum and 2 Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains demonstrated the highest final population (>8 log cfu/ml) after 3 h of exposure at low pH. The majority of the tested strains were resistant to bile salts even after 4 h of exposure, while 5 Lb. plantarum and 7 Lb. pentosus strains exhibited partial bile salt hydrolase activity. None of the strains inhibited the growth of the pathogens tested. Variable efficiency to adhere to Caco-2 cells was observed. This was the same regarding strains' susceptibility towards different antibiotics. None of the strains exhibited beta-haemolytic activity. As a whole, 4 strains of Lb. pentosus, 3 strains of Lb. plantarum and 2 strains of Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei were found to possess desirable in vitro probiotic properties similar to or even better than the reference probiotic strains Lb. casei Shirota and Lb. rhamnosus GG. These strains are good candidates for further investigation both with in vivo studies to elucidate their potential health benefits and in olive fermentation processes to assess their technological performance as novel probiotic starters.
TI  - Characterization of the major dehydrogenase related to d-lactic acid synthesis in Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ATCC 8293.
AB  - Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ATCC 8293 is a lactic acid bacterium that converts pyruvate mainly to d-(-)-lactic acid by using d-(-)-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhD). The aim of this study was to identify the gene responsible for d-lactic acid formation in this organism and to characterize the enzyme to facilitate the production of optically pure d-lactic acid. A genomic analysis of L. mesenteroides ATCC 8293 revealed that 7 genes encode lactate-related dehydrogenase. According to transcriptomic, proteomic, and phylogenetic analyses, LEUM_1756 was the major gene responsible for the production of d-lactic acid. The LEUM_1756 gene, of 996bp and encoding 332 amino acids (36.5kDa), was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Star from an inducible pET-21a(+) vector. The enzyme was purified by Ni-NTA column chromatography and showed a specific activity of 4450U/mg, significantly higher than those of other previously reported ldhDs. The gel permeation chromatography analysis showed that the purified enzyme exists as tetramers in solution and this was the first report among lactic acid bacteria. The pH and temperature optima were pH 8.0 and 30 degrees C, respectively, for the pyruvate reduction reaction, and pH 11.0 and 20 degrees C, respectively, for the lactate oxidation reaction. The K(m) kinetic parameters for pyruvate and lactate were 0.58mM and 260mM, respectively. In addition, the k(cat) values for pyruvate and lactate were 2900s(-1) and 2280s(-1), respectively. The enzyme was not inhibited by Ca(2+), Co(2+), Cu(2+), Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Na(+), or urea, but was inhibited by 1mM Zn(2+) and 1mM SDS.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - Safety evaluation of fibermalt.
AB  - Fibermalt is a new soluble fiber food ingredient produced with the use of an alternansucrase enzyme from Leuconostoc mesenteroides expressed in a non-pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli. Fibermalt is predominantly composed of indigestible maltose alternan oligosaccharides (>/= 80%). Fibermalt was non-mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation test. In a 13-week dietary rat study, fibermalt was administered at 0 (control), 50,000, 100,000 or 150,000 ppm. Statistically significant increases in food consumption were generally observed throughout the study in males receiving 100,000 or 150,000 ppm and in females receiving 100,000 ppm. However, there was no effect of fibermalt on mean body weight, body weight gain or food efficiency. All animals survived to scheduled termination and no adverse clinical signs were attributed to administration of fibermalt. There were no toxicologically relevant changes in hematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis parameters or organ weights in males or females ingesting any concentration of fibermalt. Any macroscopic or microscopic findings were considered incidental, of normal variation and/or of minimal magnitude for test substance association. Based on these results, fibermalt is not mutagenic as evaluated in a bacterial reverse mutation test and has an oral subchronic (13-week) no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 150,000 ppm in rats.
TI  - Construction of theta-type shuttle vector for Leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pCB42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  - The pCB42 plasmid from Leuconostoc citreum CB2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was constructed. The pCB42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low G+C content, and no single-stranded DNA intermediates during replication, which indicates that pCB42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. In silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 DNA-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. The fragment encompassing ORF5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. This plasmid was capable of replicating in various LAB, including L. citreum, L. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. reuteri, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Weissella confusa, and Oenococcus oeni. The LAB-E. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pCB42 and pEK104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pLeuCM42, showed a high segregational stability in L. citreum CB2567 after 100 generations of cell division. By using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from Lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, L. citreum CB2567. The pLeuCM42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering of various strains of LAB.
TI  - Evaluation of toxic effects of several carboxylic acids on bacterial growth by toxicodynamic modelling.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effects of organic acids on microbial fermentation are commonly tested in investigations about metabolic behaviour of bacteria. However, they typically provide only descriptive information without modelling the influence of acid concentrations on bacterial kinetics. RESULTS: We developed and applied a mathematical model (secondary model) to capture the toxicological effects of those chemicals on kinetic parameters that define the growth of bacteria in batch cultures. Thus, dose-response kinetics were performed with different bacteria (Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Carnobacterium pisicola, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Listonella anguillarum) exposed at increasing concentrations of individual carboxylic acids (formic, acetic, propionic, butyric and lactic). In all bioassays the acids affected the maximum bacterial load (Xm) and the maximum growth rate (vm) but only in specific cases the lag phase (lambda) was modified. Significance of the parameters was always high and in all fermentations the toxicodynamic equation was statistically consistent and had good predictability. The differences between D and L-lactic acid effects were significant for the growth of E. coli, L. mesenteroides and C. piscicola. In addition, a global parameter (EC50,tau) was used to compare toxic effects and provided a realistic characterization of antimicrobial agents using a single value. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of several organic acids on the growth of different bacteria was accurately studied and perfectly characterized by a bivariate equation which combines the basis of dose-response theory with microbial growth kinetics (secondary model). The toxicity of carboxylic acids was lower with the increase of the molecular weight of these chemicals.
TI  - Fate of Escherichia coli O26 in corn silage experimentally contaminated at ensiling, at silo opening, or after aerobic exposure, and protective effect of various bacterial inoculants.
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains are responsible for human illness. Ruminants are recognized as a major reservoir of STEC, and animal feeds, such as silages, have been pointed out as a possible vehicle for the spread of STEC. The present study aimed to monitor the fate of pathogenic E. coli O26 strains in corn material experimentally inoculated (10(5) CFU/g) during ensiling, just after silo opening, and after several days of aerobic exposure. The addition of 3 bacterial inoculants, Propionibacterium sp., Lactobacillus buchneri, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides (10(6) CFU/g), was evaluated for their abilities to control these pathogens. The results showed that E. coli O26 could not survive in corn silage 5 days postensiling, and the 3 inoculants tested did not modify the fate of pathogen survival during ensiling. In the case of direct contamination at silo opening, E. coli O26 could be totally eradicated from corn silage previously inoculated with Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The combination of proper ensiling techniques and the utilization of selected bacterial inoculants appears to represent a good strategy to guarantee nutritional qualities of cattle feed while at the same time limiting the entry of pathogenic E. coli into the epidemiological cycle to improve the microbial safety of the food chain.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and characterization of an insoluble glucan-producing glucansucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1118.
AB  - We have cloned a glucansucrase from the type strain of Leuconostoc mesenteroides  (NRRL B-1118; ATCC 8293) and successfully expressed the enzyme in Escherichia coli. The recombinant processed enzyme has a putative sequence identical to the predicted secreted native enzyme (1,473 amino acids; 161,468 Da). This enzyme catalyzed the synthesis of a water-insoluble alpha-D-glucan from sucrose (K(M) 12 mM) with a broad pH optimum between 5.0 and 5.7 in the presence of calcium. Removal of calcium with dialysis resulted in lower activity in the acidic pH range, effectively shifting the pH optimum to 6.0-6.2. The enzyme was quickly inactivated at temperatures above approximately 45 degrees C. The presence of dextran offered some protection from thermal inactivation between room temperature and 40 degrees C but had little effect above 45 degrees C. NMR and methylation analysis of the water-insoluble alpha-D-glucan revealed that it had approximately equal amounts of alpha(1 --> 3)-linked and alpha(1 --> 6)-linked D-glucopyranosyl units and a low degree of branching.
TI  - Short communication: characterization of microflora in Mexican Chihuahua cheese.
AB  - This work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 Chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in Mexico using 16S rRNA gene analysis. As expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. Sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in 9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. Lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent being Lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Streptococcus macedonicus were identified in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional Chihuahua cheese attributes.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cucumber fermentation brines.
AB  - Bacterial pathogens have been reported on fresh cucumbers and other vegetables used for commercial fermentation. The Food and Drug Administration currently has a 5-log reduction standard for E. coli O157:H7 and other vegetative pathogens in acidified pickle products. For fermented vegetables, which are acid foods, there is little data documenting the conditions needed to kill acid resistant pathogens. To address this knowledge gap, we obtained 10 different cucumber fermentation brines at different stages of fermentation from 5 domestic commercial plants. Cucumber brines were used to represent vegetable fermentations because cabbage and other vegetables may have inhibitory compounds that may affect survival. The 5-log reduction times for E. coli O157:H7 strains in the commercial brines were found to be positively correlated with brine pH, and ranged from 3 to 24 d for pH values of 3.2 to 4.6, respectively. In a laboratory cucumber juice medium that had been previously fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum or Leuconostoc mesenteroides (pH 3.9), a 5-log reduction was achieved within 1 to 16 d depending on pH, acid concentration, and temperature. During competitive growth at 30 degrees C in the presence of L. plantarum or L. mesenteroides in cucumber juice, E. coli O157:H7 cell numbers were reduced to below the level of detection within 2 to 3 d. These data may be used to aid manufacturers of fermented vegetable products determine safe production practices based on fermentation pH and temperature. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Disease causing strains of the bacterium E. coli may be present on fresh vegetables. Our investigation determined the time needed to kill E. coli in cucumber fermentation brines and how E. coli strains are killed in competition with naturally present lactic acid bacteria. Our results showed how brine pH and other brine conditions affected the killing of E. coli strains. These data can be used by producers of fermented vegetable products to help assure consumer safety.
TI  - Metabolic selective pressure stabilizes plasmids carrying biosynthetic genes for  reduced biochemicals in Escherichia coli redox mutants.
AB  - Several biotechnological processes rely on the utilization of high-copy-number plasmids for heterologous gene expression, and understanding the interactions between plasmid DNA and bacterial hosts is highly relevant for bioprocess optimization. We assessed metabolic modifications and physiological changes exerted by expression of a plasmid-encoded alcohol-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (adhE ( Lm )) in Escherichia coli redox mutants. Plasmid pET( Lm ), a pBluescript II KS(-)-derivative carrying adhE ( Lm ), was introduced in E. coli CT1061 [arcA creC(Con)]. This recombinant was able to attain a higher ethanol concentration in glycerol cultures compared to the parental strain. pBluescript II KS(-) was rapidly lost in 72-h bioreactor cultures (7.8 +/- 1.2% of plasmid-bearing cells), while pET( Lm ) was present in 92.4 +/- 7.2% of the cells. In E. coli CT1061 carrying pBluescript II KS(-) the plasmid copy number steadily diminished in bioreactor cultures to reach 334 +/- 45 copies per chromosome at 72 h, while pET( Lm ) was stably maintained, reaching 498 +/- 18 copies per chromosome at the end of the cultivation. Plasmid pETOmega( Lm ), bearing a defective copy of adhE ( Lm ) interrupted by cat, reached 293 +/- 62 copies per chromosome, implying a functional role of adhE ( Lm ) on plasmid maintenance. The intracellular NADH/NAD(+) content suggest that regeneration of oxidized co-factors by the heterologous bioreaction might play a relevant role in plasmid maintenance.
TI  - Ethanol synthesis from glycerol by Escherichia coli redox mutants expressing adhE from Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
AB  - AIMS: Analysis of the physiology and metabolism of Escherichia coli arcA and creC mutants expressing a bifunctional alcohol-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides growing on glycerol under oxygen-restricted conditions. The effect of an ldhA mutation and different growth medium modifications was also assessed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Expression of adhE in E. coli CT1061 [arcA creC(Con)] resulted in a 1.4-fold enhancement in ethanol synthesis. Significant amounts of lactate were produced during micro-oxic cultures and strain CT1061LE, in which fermentative lactate dehydrogenase was deleted, produced up to 6.5 +/- 0.3 g l(-1) ethanol in 48 h. Escherichia coli CT1061LE derivatives resistant to >25 g l(-1) ethanol were obtained by metabolic evolution. Pyruvate and acetaldehyde addition significantly increased both biomass and ethanol concentrations, probably by overcoming acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) shortage. Yeast extract also promoted growth and ethanol synthesis, and this positive effect was mainly attributable to its vitamin content. Two-stage bioreactor cultures were conducted in a minimal medium containing 100 microg l(-1) calcium d-pantothenate to evaluate oxic acetyl-CoA synthesis followed by a switch into fermentative conditions. Ethanol reached 15.4 +/- 0.9 g l(-1) with a volumetric productivity of 0.34 +/- 0.02 g l(-1) h(-1). CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli responded to adhE over-expression by funnelling carbon and reducing equivalents into a highly reduced metabolite, ethanol. Acetyl-CoA played a key role in micro-oxic ethanol synthesis and growth. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Insight into the micro-oxic metabolism of E. coli growing on glycerol is essential for the development of efficient industrial processes for reduced biochemicals production from this substrate, with special relevance to biofuels synthesis.
TI  - [Human recombinant interferon-B constructed on the basis of affinity-binding domain technology].
AB  - Fusion gene consisting of dextran-binding domain from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. Mesenteroides (DBD) and human recombinant interferon-beta (IFN-beta) incorporated between the nucleotide sequence encoding for the recognition site of human enteropeptidase (DDDDK) was installed and constructed in Escherichia coli. The overproducing strain of the chimeric protein DBD-IFN-beta consisting of the IFN-beta, spacer including 10 GS-repeats, human enteropeptidase recognition site, and dextran-binding domain from Leuconostoc mesenteroides was constructed. Free human recombinant interferon-beta was obtained as a result of treatment of the chimeric protein DBD-IFN-beta immobilized on sephadex G-25 with human enteropeptidase. The ability of free and immobilized protein to protect human cells from viral infection was demonstrated. The developed approach can be used for purification of the recombinant proteins with different biological activity and possible construction of new immunostimulating and antiviral drugs, growth factors, anti-cancer drugs, etc.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel glucansucrase from Leuconostoc lactis EG001.
AB  - A gene encoding glucansucrase was identified in Leuconostoc lactis EG001 isolated from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in Kimchi, a traditional Korean fermented food. The L. lactis EG001 glucansucrase gene consists of 4503 bp open reading frame (ORF) and encodes an enzyme of 1500 amino acids with an apparent molecular mass of 165 kDa. The deduced amino-acid sequence showed the highest amino-acid sequence identity (75%) to that of dextransucrase of L. mesenteroides. The gene was cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli strain. The recombinant enzyme was purified via Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and its enzymatic properties were characterized. The enzyme exhibited optimum activity at 30 degrees C and pH 5.0. In addition, the enzyme was able to catalyze the glycosylation of l-ascorbic acid to l-ascorbic acid 2-glucoside. The glycosylated product via EG001 glucansucrase has the potential as an antioxidant in industrial applications.
TI  - Cloning of dextransucrase gene from Leuconostoc citreum HJ-P4 and its high-level  expression in E. coli by low temperature induction.
AB  - A dextransucrase (LcDS) gene from Leuconostoc citreum HJ-P4 has been amplified and cloned in E. coli. The LcDS gene consists of 4,431 nucleotides encoding 1,477 amino acid residues sharing 63-98% of amino acid sequence identities with other known dextransucrases from Leuc. mesenteroides. Interestingly, 0.1 mM of IPTG induction at 15 degrees remarkably increased the LcDS productivity to 19,187 U/l culture broth, which was over 330-fold higher than that induced at 37 degrees. Optimal reaction temperature and pH of LcDS were determined as 35 degrees and pH 5.5 in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer, respectively. Meanwhile, 0.1 mM CaCl(2) increased its activity to the maximum of 686 U/mg, which was 2.1-fold higher than that in the absence of calcium ion. Similar to the native Leuconostoc dextransucrase, recombinant LcDS could successfully produce a series of isomaltooligosaccharides from sucrose and maltose, on the basis of its transglycosylation activity.
TI  - [Purification and characterization of recombinant Escherichia coli dextransucrase].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To purify and characterize recombinant dextransucrase expressed in engineered strain BL21 (DE3)/pET28-dexYG. METHODS: The dextransucrase gene (dexYG) was expressed in engineered strain after IPTG induction and the crude enzyme was obtained by sonication. We purified the recombinant dextransucrase by using ammonium sulfate precipitation and metal chelate affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA column. Then we characterized catalytic kinetic parameter of purified enzyme. RESULTS: This purification protocol resulted in a 11.4-fold purification with a yield of 37.5%. The molecular weight of dextransucrase measured by SDS-PAGE was 170 kDa ,which was similar to the enzyme from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The enzyme had an optimum temperature between 25 and 30 degrees C and an optimum pH of 5.4. It was relatively stable in the range of pH 5.0 to 7.0, but the stability declined rapidly as soon as the temperature rose over 35 degrees C.The enzyme activity remained 59% after stored for 4 days at room temperature (25 degrees C), and lost 50% activity after stored for seven weeks at 4 degrees C. Ca2+ of 0.5 mmol/L could strongly activate the enzyme, Mg2+ of 1 mmol/L had little effect, Cu2+ and SDS could greatly inhibit the enzyme. CONCLUSION: These results may provide an important basis for industrial applications of the recombinant dextransucrase.
TI  - Biodiversity of the microbial community in a Spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - The microbial diversity within Alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the Alpujarra mountains (Granada, south-east Spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community DNA. A collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analyses. Isolates on Man-Rogosa and Sharpe-agar (MRS), M17-glucose agar and Kenner Fecal (KF)-agar medium were identified by specific PCR or 16S rRNA gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. The predominant genus was Lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being Lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of Lb. plantarum and Lb. brevis. Other lactic-acid bacteria identified were Pediococcus urinaequi, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuc. mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci Enterococcus faecium and E. devriesei. Cluster analyses of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. The Gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to Hafnia alvei species. The microbes occurring in Alberquilla cheese were also studied by PCR temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) of the 16S rRNA V3 region and partial 16S rRNA sequencing of the TTGE bands. The results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to Lc. lactis, Lb. paracasei, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. acidophilus and Enterococcus sp. The non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as Escherichia coli. All the Enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaAfm. On the basis of their antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of Ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin B105 and mesenterocin Y105, as revealed by PCR techniques.
TI  - Functional, genetic, and bioinformatic characterization of dextransucrase (DSRBCB4) gene in Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-1299CB4.
AB  - A gene encoding a dextransucrase (dsrBCB4) that synthesizes only alpha-1,6-linked dextran was cloned from Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-1299CB4. The coding region consisted of an open reading frame (ORF) of 4,395 bp that coded a 1,465-amino-acids protein with a molecular mass 163,581 Da. The expressed recombinant DSRBCB4 (rDSRBCB4) synthesized oligosaccharides in the presence maltose or isomaltose as an acceptor, plus the products included alpha-1,6-linked glucosyl residues in addition to the maltosyl or isomaltosyl residue. Alignments of the amino acid sequence of DSRBCB4 with glucansucrases from Streptococcus and Leuconostoc identified conserved amino acid residues in the catalytic core that are critical for enzyme activity. The mutants D530N, E568Q, and D641N displayed a 98- to 10,000-fold reduction of total enzyme activity.
TI  - Characterization of a bifunctional HPr kinase/phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides SY1.
AB  - The hprK gene encoding bifunctional HPrK/P (kinase/ phosphorylase) was cloned from L. mesenteroides SY1, a strain isolated from kimchi. hprK was transcribed as a monocistronic gene. His-tagged HPrH16A and HPrK/P were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) using pET26b(+) and purified. HPrK/P phosphorylation assay with purified proteins showed that the kinase activity of HPrK/P increased at slightly acidic pHs. Divalent cations such as Mg2+ and Mn2+ and glycolytic intermediates such as fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) increased the kinase activity of HPrK/P, but inorganic phosphate strongly inhibited it. Kinetic studies for the kinase activity of HPrK/P showed that the apparent Km values were 0.18 and 14.57 microM for ATP and HPr, respectively. The Km value for the phosphorylase activity of HPrK/P was 14.16 microM for P-Ser-HPr (HPr phosphorylated at the serine residue).
TI  - Functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  - This paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. Functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. The organisms previously identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. acidophilus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc dextranicum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees C) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). The pH fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with Lb. plantarum; 4.37 in L. dextranicum+S. cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. Significant differences (P <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. Bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among pH and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. Antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic A. flavus. The findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of a dextransucrase gene (dexYG) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
AB  - The gene dexYG encoding the dextransucrase from an industrial strain of Leuconostoc mesenteroides 0326 was isolated by PCR. The nucleotide sequence of the dexYG gene consists of an open reading frame (ORF) of 4,584 bp, coding for a 1,527 aa protein with a Mr of 170 kDa. The results were analysed by a BLAST similarity search of the GenBank database, which revealed the amino acid sequence was similiar to dsrD derived from L. mesenteroides Lcc4. The dexYG gene was subcloned into the plasmid pET28a(+) and was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by IPTG induction. The pH value was one of the main reasons which caused the degradation of enzyme activity in the later stage of induction. The highest activity was reached 36 U/ml after 5 h induction in medium at pH 6.0. Biotransformation yield of the enzyme reached 65% and the molecular weight of transformed dextran was more than 68 kDa in 2 h.
TI  - Probiotic Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris and Streptococcus thermophilus  induce IL-12 and IFN-gamma production.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the capacity of potentially probiotic strains from six bacterial genera to induce cytokine production alone or in combinations in order to identify potential enhancing or synergistic effects in order to select probiotic bacteria for in vivo purposes. METHODS: Cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in response to stimulation with eleven different potentially probiotic bacterial strains from Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Propionibacterium genera was analysed. Production and mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-12, IFN-gamma and IL-10 were determined by ELISA and Northern blotting, respectively. RESULTS: All tested bacteria induced TNF-alpha production. The best inducers of Th1 type cytokines IL-12 and IFN-gamma were Streptococcus and Leuconostoc strains. All Bifidobacterium and Propionibacterium strains induced higher IL-10 production than other studied bacteria. Stimulation of PBMC with any bacterial combinations did not result in enhanced cytokine production suggesting that different bacteria whether gram-positive or gram-negative compete with each other during host cell interactions. CONCLUSION: The probiotic S. thermophilus and Leuconostoc strains are more potent inducers of Th1 type cytokines IL-12 and IFN-gamma than the probiotic Lactobacillus strains. Bacterial combinations did not result in enhanced cytokine production.
TI  - Expression and characterization of dextransucrase gene dsrX from Leuconostoc mesenteroides in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The dextransucrase gene dsrX from Leuconostoc mesenteroides CGMCC 1.544 was cloned into the vector pET-28a(+) and expressed as a N-terminal His(6)-tag fusion protein of 167.57 kDa in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). DsrX with the high volumetric activity of 8.8 U ml(-1) culture and the specific activity of 97.37 U mg(-1) crude enzyme extracts was measured in the optimized recombinant expression system. The resultant expression level of the fusion protein amounted to 24.5% of the total cell proteins. The results of affinity chromatography and western blotting indicated that the three sensitive sites of proteolysis existed in the N-terminal catalytic domain of DsrX. Both the recombinant and native enzyme activity were slightly activated by 1 mmol l(-1) Mn(2+) and strongly inhibited by 1 mmol l(-1) Cu(2+) or Al(3+), and their optimum pH values were 5.4. The optimum temperature of the recombinant enzyme for dextran synthesis was 30 degrees C, which was 10 degrees C less than that of the native one. The transglucosylation products of two enzymes were studied by using thin layer chromatography and high-performance anion exchange chromatography. It could be concluded that the better sample-pretreatment temperature in SDS-PAGE was 37 degrees C, which significantly improved the detection of thermal instable enzyme than that of 100 degrees C.
TI  - Succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a PCR-based approach.
AB  - The goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using PCR. In a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, PCR enabled detection of Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. Subsequently, Lactobacillus and Pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. Nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of Pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. PCR also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin A producers and accounted for the LAB succession in the fermenting samples. A total of 328 LAB isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which PCR could identify an overwhelming 186 Lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 Pediococcus and 29 Leuconostoc isolates, respectively. Based on antimicrobial assay against target strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B640, 28% of the LAB were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin A and mesentericin producers. The bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of Gram-positive target LAB strains and pathogenic bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Development of a monitoring vector for Leuconostoc mesenteroides using the green  fluorescent protein gene.
AB  - The vector pCW5 with plasmid pC7, originally isolated in Lactobacillus paraplantarum C7 derived from kimchi, was constructed using a p32 strong promoter, the pC7 replicon, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as the reporter. The constructed vector was transformed into E. coli and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and GFP expression detected using a Western blot analysis. GFP fluorescence was recognized in E. coli and Leuconostoc mesenteroides using a confocal microscope. In addition, GFP fluorescence was also clearly detected in several industrially important lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, and Lactobacillus plantarum. Thus, pCW5 was shown to be effective for Leuconostoc mesenteroides when using GFP as the reporter, and it can also be used as a broad-host-range vector for other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Role of the C-terminal region of dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides IBT-PQ in cell anchoring.
AB  - dsrP, a gene that encodes a cell-associated dextransucrase produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides IBT-PQ, was isolated, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. From sequence analysis, seven repeat units in the N-terminal region were found, as well as five cell wall binding repeats in the C-terminal region. A model of the C-terminal domain of dextransucrase was built based on the solenoid structure of the cell wall binding domain already described in LytA. By experiments involving direct interactions of the enzyme with L. mesenteroides cells, as well as among the cells and the single C-terminal domain expressed in E. coli, evidence was obtained concerning the anchoring function of this region in cell-associated dextransucrase, a function which may be independent of its capacity to bind dextran.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the sucrose phosphorylase gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene encoding sucrose phosphorylase (742sp) in Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-742 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the transformed 742sp comprised an ORF of 1,458 bp giving a protein with calculated molecular mass of 55.3 kDa. 742SPase contains a C-terminal amino acid sequence that is significantly different from those of other Leu. mesenteroides SPases. The purified 742SPase had a specific activity of 1.8 U/mg with a K (m) of 3 mM with sucrose as a substrate; optimum activity was at 37 degrees C and pH 6.7. The purified 742SPase transferred the glucosyl moiety of sucrose to cytosine monophosphate (CMP).
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria within the consortium of a kefir grain by  sequencing 16S rDNA variable regions.
AB  - The microflora of a kefir grain was identified using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy combined with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. DNA was extracted from the kefir grain and amplified in its 16S rDNA V1 and V2 regions. To guarantee a good representation of the overall lactic acid bacteria populations, DNA amplification was performed separately with primers specific either to the dominant or to the less abundant bacterial groups. The amplified fragments were cloned in Escherichia coli and then sequenced. Sequences of the V1 region were gathered into 5 groups of similarity and identified by aligning with the sequences of a public library. The V1 region allowed the identification of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, L. kefir, L. parakefir, and Lactococcus lactis but was inappropriate for the identification of leuconostocs at species level. Among 16S rDNA variable regions, the V2 region showed the highest variability between Leuconostoc species. Nevertheless, even in the V2 region, differences were too tenuous for effective identification of L. mesenteroides. The methodology described here allowed detection of the dominant species within each targeted microbial group.
TI  - Recombinant sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides: characterization, kinetic studies of transglucosylation, and application of immobilised enzyme for production of alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate.
AB  - Sucrose phosphorylase catalyzes the reversible conversion of sucrose (alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-1,2-beta-D-fructofuranoside) and phosphate into D-fructose and alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate. We report on the molecular cloning and expression of the structural gene encoding sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (LmSPase) in Escherichia coli DH10B. The recombinant enzyme, containing an 11 amino acid-long N-terminal metal affinity fusion peptide, was overproduced 60-fold in comparison with the natural enzyme. It was purified to apparent homogeneity using copper-loaded Chelating Sepharose and obtained in 20% yield with a specific activity of 190 Umg(-1). LmSPase was covalently attached onto Eupergit C with a binding efficiency of 50% and used for the continuous production of alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate from sucrose and phosphate (600 mM each) in a packed-bed immobilised enzyme reactor (30 degrees C, pH 7.0). The reactor was operated at a stable conversion of 91% (550 mM product) and productivity of approximately 11 gl(-1)h(-1) for up to 600 h. A kinetic study of transglucosylation by soluble LmSPase was performed using alpha-d-glucose 1-phosphate as the donor substrate and various alcohols as acceptors. D- and L-arabitol were found to be good glucosyl acceptors.
TI  - Structural and functional features of fructansucrases present in Leuconostoc mesenteroides ATCC 8293.
AB  - Glycosyltransferases produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ATCC 8293 (equivalent to NRRL B-1118) were identified. Two glucansucrases and one fructansucrases were observed in batch culture while levC and levL genes, corresponding to two fructansucrases, were isolated from information obtained from the released draft sequence of this Leuconostoc strain genome and cloned in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzymes were shown to be fructansucrases producing a polymer identified by NMR as levan, confirming our recent report stating that these are also mosaic levansucrases bearing structural features of glucansucrases in the amino and carboxy terminal regions, as is also the case of inulosucrase (IslA) from Leuconostoc citreum CW28 and levansucrase (LevS) from L. mesenteroides NRRL B-512F. The recombinant levansucrase LevC was purified and characterized in terms of pH, temperature, and kinetic properties. The enzyme exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetic properties with a K(m) = 27.3 mM and a k(cat) = 282.9 s(-1). This levansucrase behaves mainly as a transferase as only 30% of the substrate is hydrolyzed in a wide range of sucrose concentrations, with higher hydrolytic activities at low substrate concentrations. With this report we experimentally confirm the unusual structural pattern displayed by fructansucrases present in Leuconostoc species that group as a novel sub family of fructansucrases.
TI  - Characterization of pFMBL1, a small cryptic plasmid isolated from Leuconostoc mesenteroides SY2.
AB  - A 4661bp cryptic plasmid, pFMBL1, was isolated from Leuconostoc mesenteroides SY2, an isolate from Kimchi, and characterized. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. orf2 was 453bp in size and its translation product had 58% identity with a putative protein possibly involved in the replication of pTXL1, a cryptic plasmid from L. mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides Y110. RNA transcript from orf2 was detected but not from orf1 or intergenic region. Minimum 3.5kb fragment encompassing orf1 and orf2 was required for the replication of pFMBL1 and employed for the construction of Escherichia coli-Leuconostoc shuttle vector, pSJ33E. L. mesenteroides SY1 (another Kimchi isolate), Leuconostoc ssp., and Lactobacillus brevis were successfully transformed with pSJ33E, and the transformation efficiencies were ranged between 1.1x10(1) and 4x10(5)transformants/microg DNA. No single-stranded DNA intermediate was detected from L. mesenteroides SY1 cells harboring pSJ33E, indicating that pFMBL1 probably replicated via theta-type mechanism. pSJ33E was stably maintained in L. mesenteroides SY1 in the absence of erythromycin (Em, 5 microg/ml) and after 1 month of daily subculturing in MRS broth without selective pressure, three percent of cells still retained pSJ33E.
TI  - High-level production and purification of a fully active recombinant dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F.
AB  - Recombinant expression of the dextransucrase dsrS gene by Escherichia coli was optimized to produce 5850 U L(-1) (culture) of DSR-S, corresponding to a 30-fold increase compared with previous studies. Rational deletions of the signal peptide, the beginning of the variable region and the last four repeats of the C-terminal end caused no loss of activity. This new variant successfully purified was remarkably stable. With a k(cat) of 584 s(-1), it is the most efficient recombinant glucansucrase described to date. The synthesized polymer possesses more than 95% of alpha-1,6 links, like the dextran produced by the native enzyme, and innovative gel properties were obtained.
TI  - Cloning, expression and characterization of an extracellular enolase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
AB  - Enolase on the surface of streptococci putatively facilitates pathogenic invasion of the host organisms. The related Leuconostoc mesenteroides 512FMCM is nonpathogenic, but it too has an extracellular enolase. Purified isolates of extracellular dextransucrase from cultures of L. mesenteroides contain minute amounts of enolase, which separate as small crystals. Expression of L. mesenteroides enolase in Escherichia coli provides a protein (calculated subunit mass of 47 546 Da) catalyzing the conversion of 2-phsopho-D-glycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. The pH optimum is 6.8, with Km and kcat values of 2.61 mM and 27.5 s(-1), respectively. At phosphate concentrations of 1 mM and below, fluoride is a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to 2-phospho-D-glycerate, but in the presence of 20 mM phosphate, fluoride becomes a competitive inhibitor. Recombinant enolase significantly inhibits the activity of purified dextransucrase, and does not bind human plasminogen. Results here suggest that in some organisms enolase may participate in protein interactions that have no direct relevance to pathogenic invasion.
TI  - Identification and functional characterization of levS, a gene encoding for a levansucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512 F.
AB  - A Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512 F levansucrase gene, (levS), was isolated, sequenced and cloned in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was shown to be a fructosyltransferase producing a polymer identified by (13)C-NMR as levan. Based on sequence analysis, we found that this levansucrase is a mosaic protein, bearing structural features of glucosyltransferases in the amino and carboxy terminal regions similarly to inulosucrase from Leuconostoc citreum. The phylogenetic analysis of the C-terminal region domain of levansucrases from L. mesenteroides demonstrates that they group together into a novel putative sub-family of genes and evolved long before all other glucosyltransferases, while their catalytic domain structure is species related.
TI  - D-lactic acid production by metabolically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - Poly D-lactic acid is an important polymer because it improves the thermostability of poly L-lactic acid by the stereo complex formation. We constructed a metabolically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae that produces D-lactic acid efficiently. In this recombinant, the coding region of pyruvate decarboxylase 1 (PDC1) was completely deleted, and two copies of the D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides strain NBRC3426 were introduced into the genome. The D-lactate production reached 61.5 g/l, the amount of glucose being transformed into D-lactic acid being 61.2% under neutralizing conditions. Additionally, the yield of free D-lactic acid was also shown to be 53.0% under non-neutralizing conditions. It was confirmed that D-lactic acid of extremely high optical purity of 99.9% or higher. Our finding obtained the possibility of a new approach for pure d-lactic acid production without a neutralizing process compared with other techniques involving lactic acid bacteria and transgenic Escherichia coli.
TI  - Changes in linkage pattern of glucan products induced by substitution of Lys residues in the dextransucrase.
AB  - Dextransucrase S (DSRS) is the only active glucansucrase that has been found in Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F strain. Native DSRS produces mainly 6-linked glucopyranosyl residue (Glcp), while Escherichia coli recombinant DSRS was observed to produce a glucan consisting of 70% 6-linked Glcp and 15% 3,6-Glcp. Lys residues were introduced at the N-terminal end of the core domain by site-directed mutagenesis. In glucans produced by the one-point mutants T350K and S455K, the amount of 6-linked Glcp was increased to about 85% of the total glucan produced, more similar in structure to native B-512F dextran. The double mutant T350K/S455K produced adhesive, water-insoluble glucan with 77% 6-linked Glcp, 8% 3,6-linked Glcp and 4% 2,6-linked Glcp. The T350K/S455K mutant exhibited a 10-fold increase in glucosyltransferase activity over those of the parental DSRS-His(6) and its T350K and S455K mutants. This is the first report demonstrating a change in the properties of a dextransucrase or a related glucosyltransferase through simple site-directed mutagenesis to create 2,6-linked Glcp.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the gene encoding phosphoketolase in Leuconostoc  mesenteroides isolated from kimchi.
AB  - The gene encoding phosphoketolase, which is 2749 bp long and contains 814 amino acid polypeptides with a total molecular mass of 91.9 kDa, was cloned from Leuconostoc mesenteroides C7 (LMC7) and expressed in Escherichia coli. It exhibited a homology of >58% with phosphoketolases from other lactic acid bacteria. The phosphoketolase of LMC7 belongs to the xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P)/fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) phosphoketolase (Xfp) family, which is an enzyme with dual specificity for X5P and F6P. The members of this family contain typical thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) binding sites as reported for other TPP-dependent enzymes, and several highly conserved regions as signature patterns for phosphoketolases. The plasmid pGPK containing the Xfp gene (xfp) exhibits phosphoketolase activity in E. coli. The specific activities of the enzyme from E. coli BL21 and E. coli EC101 harboring xfp were 0.28 and 0.14 units/mg, respectively. They both exhibited a 1.5-fold increase in the production of acetic acid from acetyl phosphate compared with their corresponding original strain.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  - Bacteriocin-producing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum ST23LD and ST341LD, Enterococcus faecium ST311LD and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ST33LD were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. The bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis, L. casei and Streptococcus pneumoniae), but also Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strain ST23LD produced two bacteriocins (ST23LDa and ST23LDb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kDa, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 AU/ml after 18 h of growth. The same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin ST341LD (approximately 3.0 kDa), but after 16 h. Bacteriocins ST311LD (ca. 2.3 kDa) and ST33LD (ca. 2.7 kDa) were produced at much lower levels (6400 AU/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. Bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and Triton X, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees C. Addition of bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST311LD to cells of Lactobacillus casei LHS in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. Bacteriocin ST33LD also inhibited the growth of strain LHS, but to a lesser extent. Bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST33LD remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at pH<4.0. However, the activity of bacteriocin ST311LD decreased by 50% within 2 h at pH 4.4. The possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the bifunctional alcohol/acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene (adhE) in Leuconostoc mesenteroides isolated from kimchi.
AB  - A bifunctional alcohol/acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (AdhE) gene (adhE) was cloned from Leuconostoc mesenteroides C7 (LMC7), which is the dominant lactic acid bacterium produced during heterofermentation of kimchi. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment containing putative adhE, which is 2685 bp long and encodes an 886 amino acid polypeptide, exhibits 99% homology with Leu. mesenteroides sp. cremoris. The deduced AdhE comprises two conserved domains: alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh). Moreover, two NAD-binding sites were observed, based on the presence of the GXGXXG motif. A pADHE containing the adhE gene expressed AdhE at the translational level in Escherichia coli BL21, which was at a higher level than in E. coli DH5alpha and E. coli JM109. The AdhE of LMC7 showed Adh and Aldh activities that, when expressed in E. coli. BL21, were 7.5 and 5.7 U mg(-1) , respectively.
TI  - pIH01, a small cryptic plasmid from Leuconostoc citreum IH3.
AB  - A small cryptic plasmid pIH01 from Leuconostoc citreum IH3 was characterized. This 1.8-kb sized plasmid contains single open reading frame that encodes a RepC class protein (342 amino acids) and a conserved pT181-type double strand origin, suggesting a rolling circle replication mode. This putative replicase protein shows the highest similarity to a replicase from pFR18 plasmid of Leuconostoc mesenteroides FR52 (64% identity), one of the pT181-type rolling circle plasmid family and contains a strictly conserved RepC-type active site sequence of pT181 family. A shuttle vector that was developed on the basis of this cryptic plasmid by insertion of both erythromycin resistance gene (ermC) from pE194 and Escherichia coli ColE1 origin was able to transform Leuconostoc strains, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactococcus lactis. Therefore, pIH01 derivative plasmids might be useful for the manipulation of Leuconostoc strains.
TI  - Structural studies of glucose-6-phosphate and NADP+ binding to human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
AB  - Human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is NADP(+)-dependent and catalyses the first and rate-limiting step of the pentose phosphate shunt. Binary complexes of the human deletion mutant, DeltaG6PD, with glucose-6-phosphate and NADP(+) have been crystallized and their structures solved to 2.9 and 2.5 A, respectively. The structures are compared with the previously determined structure of the Canton variant of human G6PD (G6PD(Canton)) in which NADP(+) is bound at the structural site. Substrate binding in DeltaG6PD is shown to be very similar to that described previously in Leuconostoc mesenteroides G6PD. NADP(+) binding at the coenzyme site is seen to be comparable to NADP(+) binding in L. mesenteroides G6PD, although some differences arise as a result of sequence changes. The tetramer interface varies slightly among the human G6PD complexes, suggesting flexibility in the predominantly hydrophilic dimer-dimer interactions. In both complexes, Pro172 of the conserved peptide EKPxG is in the cis conformation; it is seen to be crucial for close approach of the substrate and coenzyme during the enzymatic reaction. Structural NADP(+) binds in a very similar way in the DeltaG6PD-NADP(+) complex and in G6PD(Canton), while in the substrate complex the structural NADP(+) has low occupancy and the C-terminal tail at the structural NADP(+) site is disordered. The implications of possible interaction between the structural NADP(+) and G6P are considered.
TI  - Cloning and expression of levansucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-512 FMC in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-512 FMC produces dextran and levan using sucrose. Because of the industrial importance of dextrans and oligosaccharides synthesized by dextransucrase (one of glycansucrases from L. mesenteroides), much is known about the dextransucrase, including expression and regulation of gene. However, no detailed report about levansucrase, another industrially important glycansucrase from L. mesenteroides, and its gene was available. In this paper, we report the first-time isolation and molecular characterization of a L. mesenteroides levansucrase gene (m1ft). The gene m1ft is composed of 1272-bp nucleotides and codes for a protein of 424 amino acid residues with calculated molecular mass of 47.1 kDa. The purified protein was estimated to be about 51.7 kDa including a His-tag based on SDS-PAGE. It showed an activity band at 103 kDa on a non-denaturing SDS-PAGE, indicating a dimeric form of the active M1FT. M1FT levan structure was confirmed by NMR and dot blot analysis with an anti-levan-antibody. M1FT converted 150 mM sucrose to levan (18%), 1-kestose (17%), nystose (11%) and 1,1,1-kestopentaose (7%) with the liberation of glucose. The M1FT enzyme produced erlose [O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-fructof uranoside] as an acceptor product with maltose. The optimum temperature and pH of this enzyme for levan formation were 30 degrees C and pH 6.2, respectively. M1FT levansucrase activity was completely abolished by 1 mM Hg2+ or Ag2+. The Km and Vmax values for levansucrase were calculated to be 26.6 mM and 126.6 micromol min-1 mg-1.
TI  - Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 53608 mdh gene cloning and recombinant mannitol dehydrogenase characterization.
AB  - A gene encoding mannitol-2-dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.1.1.138) (MDH) was cloned from Lactobacillus reuteri and expressed in Escherichia coli. The 1,008-bp gene encodes a protein consisting of 336 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 35,920 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of L. reuteri MDH (LRMDH) is 77% and 76% similar to the MDHs from Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. The purified recombinant enzyme appears as a single band of 40 kDa in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but gel filtration indicates that the native enzyme is a dimer. The optimum temperature for the recombinant enzyme is 37 degrees C, the pH optima for D-fructose reduction and D-mannitol oxidation are 5.4 and 6.2, respectively. The K(m) values for NAD (9 mM) and NADH (0.24 mM) are significantly higher than those for NADP (0.35 mM) and NADPH (0.04 mM). The K(m) values of LRMDH for D-fructose and D-mannitol are 34 mM and 54 mM, respectively. Contrary to what the enzyme sequence suggests, recombinant LRMDH contains a single catalytic zinc per subunit.
TI  - Role of the two catalytic domains of DSR-E dextransucrase and their involvement in the formation of highly alpha-1,2 branched dextran.
AB  - The dsrE gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 was shown to encode a very large protein with two potentially active catalytic domains (CD1 and CD2) separated by a glucan binding domain (GBD). From sequence analysis, DSR-E was classified in glucoside hydrolase family 70, where it is the only enzyme to have two catalytic domains. The recombinant protein DSR-E synthesizes both alpha-1,6 and alpha-1,2 glucosidic linkages in transglucosylation reactions using sucrose as the donor and maltose as the acceptor. To investigate the specific roles of CD1 and CD2 in the catalytic mechanism, truncated forms of dsrE were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Gene products were then small-scale purified to isolate the various corresponding enzymes. Dextran and oligosaccharide syntheses were performed. Structural characterization by (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance and/or high-performance liquid chromatography showed that enzymes devoid of CD2 synthesized products containing only alpha-1,6 linkages. On the other hand, enzymes devoid of CD1 modified alpha-1,6 linear oligosaccharides and dextran acceptors through the formation of alpha-1,2 linkages. Therefore, each domain is highly regiospecific, CD1 being specific for the synthesis of alpha-1,6 glucosidic bonds and CD2 only catalyzing the formation of alpha-1,2 linkages. This finding permitted us to elucidate the mechanism of alpha-1,2 branching formation and to engineer a novel transglucosidase specific for the formation of alpha-1,2 linkages. This enzyme will be very useful to control the rate of alpha-1,2 linkage synthesis in dextran or oligosaccharide production.
TI  - Efficacy of Leuconostoc mesenteroides (ATCC 13146) isomaltooligosaccharides as a  poultry prebiotic.
AB  - The complex dietary carbohydrates, called prebiotics, have been used to control Salmonella and improve intestinal bacterial balance in broilers. Leuconostoc mesenteroides (ATCC 13146) isomaltooligosaccharides (IMO) stimulate growth of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and are not used by Salmonella or Escherichia coli. We tested the efficacy of these IMO as a prebiotic. IMO, compared with fructooligosaccharides (FOS) as sole carbon source, promoted growth of chicken cecal isolates and Bifidobacterium. Cecal isolates and Salmonella typhimurium grown in mixed culture on IMO reduced the Salmonella population. Cecal isolates grown on IMO showed higher viable counts and faster growth than Salmonella, indicating a potential value for these oligomers for poultry intestinal microflora modification.
TI  - The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus has a novel structure.
AB  - In Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, oxaloacetate synthesis is a major and  essential CO(2)-fixation reaction. This methanogenic archaeon possesses two oxaloacetate-synthesizing enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from this organism was purified to homogeneity. The subunit size of this homotetrameric protein was 55 kDa, which is about half that of all known bacterial and eukaryotic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases (PPCs). The NH(2)-terminal sequence identified this enzyme as the product of MTH943, an open reading frame with no assigned function in the genome sequence. A BLAST search did not show an obvious sequence similarity between MTH943 and known PPCs, which are generally well conserved. This is the first report of a new type of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase that we call PpcA ("A" for "archaeal"). Homologs to PpcA were present in most archaeal genomic sequences, but only in three bacterial (Clostridium perfringens, Oenococcus oeni, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) and no eukaryotic genomes. PpcA was the only recognizable oxaloacetate-producing enzyme in Methanopyrus kandleri, a hydrothermal vent organism. Each PpcA-containing organism lacked a PPC homolog. The activity of M. thermautotrophicus PpcA was not influenced by acetyl coenzyme A and was about 50 times less sensitive to aspartate than the Escherichia coli PPC. The catalytic core (including His(138), Arg(587), and Gly(883)) of the E. coli PPC was partly conserved in PpcA, but three of four aspartate-binding residues (Lys(773), Arg(832), and Asn(881)) were not. PPCs probably evolved from PpcA through a process that added allosteric sites to the enzyme. The reverse is also equally possible.
TI  - Cloning, sequence analysis and expression of the F1F0-ATPase beta-subunit from wine lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding the F1F0-ATPase beta-subunit from  Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Pediococcus damnosus, Pediococcus parvulus, Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus hilgardii were determined. Their deduced amino acid sequences showed homology values of 79-98%. Data from the alignment and ATPase tree indicated that O. oeni and L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides formed a group well-separated from P. damnosus and P. parvulus and from the group comprises L. brevis and L. hilgardii. The N-terminus of the F1F0-ATPase beta-subunit of O. oeni contains a stretch of additional 38 amino acid residues. The catalytic site of the ATPase beta-subunit of the investigated strains is characterized by the two conserved motifs GGAGVGKT and GERTRE. The amplified atpD coding sequences were inserted into the pCRT7/CT-TOPO vector using TA-cloning strategy and transformed in Escherichia coli. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses confirmed that O. oeni has an ATPase beta-subunit protein which is larger in size than the corresponding molecules from the investigated strains.
TI  - Molecular characterization of inulosucrase from Leuconostoc citreum: a fructosyltransferase within a glucosyltransferase.
AB  - The gene coding for inulosucrase in Leuconostoc citreum CW28, islA, was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme catalyzed inulin synthesis from sucrose like the wild-type enzyme. Inulosucrase presents an unusual structure: its N-terminal region is similar to the variable region of glucosyltransferases, its catalytic domain is similar to fructosyltransferases from various microorganisms, and its C-terminal domain presents similarity to the glucan binding domain from alternansucrase, a glucosyltransferase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1355. From sequence comparison, it was found that this fructosyltransferase is a natural chimeric enzyme resulting from the substitution of the catalytic domain of alternansucrase by a fructosyltransferase. Two different forms of the islA gene truncated in the C-terminal glucan binding domain were successfully expressed in E. coli and retained their ability to synthesize inulin but lost thermal stability. This is the first report of an inulosucrase bearing structural features of both glucosyltransferases and fructosyltransferases.
TI  - Interactive inhibition of meat spoilage and pathogenic bacteria by lysozyme, nisin and EDTA in the presence of nitrite and sodium chloride at 24 degrees C.
AB  - To develop a nisin- and lysozyme-based antimicrobial treatment for use with processed ham and bologna, in vitro experiments were conducted to determine whether inhibition enhancing interactions occur between the antimicrobials lysozyme, chrisin (a commercial nisin preparation), EDTA, NaCl and NaNO(2). Inhibitory interactions were observed between a number of agents when used against specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. The observed interactions included lysozyme with EDTA (Enterococcus faecalis and Weissella viridescens), chrisin with EDTA (all Gram-positive organisms), EDTA with NaCl (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Serratia grimesii), EDTA with nitrite (E. coli, Lactobacillus curvatus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Listeria monocytogenes, S. Typhimurium), chrisin with nitrite (Lc. mesenteroides, L. monocytogenes), and NaCl with nitrite (S. Typhimurium, Shewanella putrefaciens). Previous reports have described interactions between nisin with EDTA that resulted in enhanced antimicrobial effect against Gram-negative bacteria, or lysozyme with nisin against Gram-positive bacteria. These interactions were not observed in these experiments. We observed that unlike previous studies, these experiments were conducted on growing cells in nutrient broth, rather than under conditions of nutrient limitation. We propose that screening of antimicrobials for use in food systems in nutrient-deficient systems is inappropriate and that new protocols should be developed.
TI  - Glucooligosaccharides from Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-742 (ATCC 13146): a potential prebiotic.
AB  - There is an emerging market for functional oligosaccharides for use in foods. Currently, technology for the production of oligosaccharides is limited to extraction from plant sources, acid or enzymatic hydrolysis of polysaccharides or synthesis by transglycosylation reactions. Oligosaccharides can also be produced using a Leuconostoc fermentation and restricting the polymer size by addition of maltose. Maltose limits the dextransucrase reaction, yielding high concentrations of alpha-glucooligosaccharides. Branched oligomers produced by this process were readily catabolized by bifidobacteria and lactobacilli but were not readily utilized by either Salmonella sp. or Escherichia coli, pointing toward their use in intestinal microflora modification.
TI  - A PCR-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  - We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. One specific primer, LbLMA1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes in a number of Lactobacillus strains. Amplification with LbLMA1-rev and R16-1, a universal primer, generated a PCR product for 23 Lactobacillus species. Electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Carnobacterium pissicola, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Weissella confusa, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes DNA were used as template.
TI  - Molecular characterization of DSR-E, an alpha-1,2 linkage-synthesizing dextransucrase with two catalytic domains.
AB  - A novel Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 dextransucrase gene, dsrE, was isolated, sequenced, and cloned in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme was shown to be an original glucansucrase which catalyses the synthesis of alpha-1,6 and alpha-1,2 linkages. The nucleotide sequence of the dsrE gene consists of an open reading frame of 8,508 bp coding for a 2,835-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 313,267 Da. This is twice the average mass of the glucosyltransferases (GTFs) known so far, which is consistent with the presence of an additional catalytic domain located at the carboxy terminus of the protein and of a central glucan-binding domain, which is also significantly longer than in other glucansucrases. From sequence comparison with family 70 and alpha-amylase enzymes, crucial amino acids involved in the catalytic mechanism were identified, and several original sequences located at some highly conserved regions in GTFs were observed in the second catalytic domain.
TI  - The mannitol dehydrogenase gene (mdh) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides is distinct  from other known bacterial mdh genes.
AB  - The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the intact protein and three tryptic peptides from a 41 kDa protein purified from a commercial mannitol dehydrogenase (MDH) enzyme preparation of Leuconostoc mesenteroides ATCC-9135 were determined. Oligonucleotides deduced from these peptide sequences were used to isolate the putative mdh gene from L. mesenteroides using the Vectorette system. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame (ORF1) of 1,014 bp encoding a putative MDH protein of 338 amino acids, and another open reading frame (ORF2) encoding an unknown protein of 245 amino acids. In Northern blots, a transcript of approximately 2.2-kb was detected with an mdh-specific probe. Mapping of the 5'-end of the 2.2-kb transcript indicated that mdh was the first gene of the operon. After fusion of six histidine codons to the 3'-end of the mdh gene and expression in Escherichia coli M15, active MDH was isolated using HisTrap purification. The overexpressed enzyme showed high specificity for mannitol and fructose. In dot blot hybridisation, the L. mesenteroides mdh-specific probe bound strongly to chromosomal DNA of Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides and weakly to DNA of some heterofermentative Lactobacillus strains, whereas no hybridisation signals were obtained with DNA derived from strains carrying characterised mdh genes. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence similarity between L. mesenteroides MDH and other known MDHs was very low, suggesting that MDHs from heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria form a structurally and functionally separate enzyme group. Interestingly, L. mesenteroides MDH shared significant sequence similarity with the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase protein family.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of foodborne Paenibacillus and Bacillus spp. against Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - The saprophytic Paenibacillus and Bacillus spp. found in cooked chilled foods may have an effect on the growth of Clostridium botulinum, a major microbiological hazard, especially for pasteurized vacuum-packaged products. Culture supernatants of 200 strains of Paenibacillus and Bacillus strains isolated from commercial cooked chilled foods containing vegetables were screened for activity against C. botulinum type A, proteolytic type B, and type E strains in a well diffusion assay. Nineteen strains were positive against C. botulinum. Among those, seven Paenibacillus polymyxa strains showed the highest antibotulinal activity and the largest antimicrobial spectrum against C. botulinum strains. The antibotulinal activity was evaluated throughout the growth of a representative strain of the positive P. polymyxa strains. The antimicrobial activity was detected in the culture supernatant from late-log/early stationary phase of the bacteria, which occurred after 7 to 10 days of incubation at 10 degrees C and after 2 to 3 days at 20 degrees C in nutrient broth and in vegetable purees under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. In co-cultures with the positive strain of P. polymyxa in nutrient broth and vegetable purees, a C. botulinum type E strain was inhibited whenever P. polymyxa reached stationary phase and produced its antimicrobial activity before C. botulinum began its exponential growth phase. The antimicrobial activity of P. polymyxa against C. botulinum was attributed to the production of antimicrobial peptides resistant to high temperature and acidity. Other gram-positive and -negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus subtilis) were also sensitive to these antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - Chemical and microbiological characterisation of kefir grains.
AB  - Chemical and microbiological composition of four Argentinean kefir grains from different sources as well as characteristics of the corresponding fermented milk were studied. Kefir grains CIDCA AGK1, AGK2 and AGK4 did not show significant differences in their chemical and microbiological composition. In contrast, protein and yeast content of AGK3 was higher than in the other grains. Although grain microflora comprised lactobacilli, lactococcus, acetic acid bacteria and yeast, we found an important difference regarding species. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus kefir, Lactobacillus plantarum, Acetobacter and Saccharomyces were present in all types of kefir grain. While Leuconostoc mesenteroides was only isolated from grains CIDCA AGK1 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis, Lactobacillus parakefir and Kluyveromyces marxianus were only isolated from CIDCA AGK2 grains. All grains produced acid products with pH between 3.5 and 4.0. The apparent viscosity of AGK1 fermented milk was greater than the product obtained with AGK4. All fermented milks had inhibitory power towards Escherichia coli but AGK1 and AGK2 supernatants were able to halt the bacterial growth for at least 25 h. Grain weight increment in AGK1, AGK2 and AGK3 during growth in milk did not show significant differences. Despite their fermenting activity, AGK4 grains did not increase their weight.
TI  - Water-soluble and water-insoluble glucans produced by Escherichia coli recombinant dextransucrases from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F.
AB  - Two dextransucrase genes, dsrS and dsrT5, from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F were expressed in Escherichia coli, and recombinant dsrT5 dextransucrase was shown to produce a water-insoluble glucan. In contrast, native dextran from L. mesenteroides B-512F is water-soluble. The water-insoluble glucan was shown by 13C NMR and glycosyl-linkage composition analysis to contain about 50% 6-linked Glcp and 40% 3-linked Glcp. The 'primitive' B-512F strain is suggested to have produced water-insoluble glucan containing 3-linked Glcp. The glucans produced by dextransucrases expressed in E. coli contained 4-linked Glcp, as shown by glycosyl-linkage composition analysis. The amount of 4-linked Glcp was increased when the truncated, water-insoluble, glucan-producing dextransucrase, which does not have C-terminal repeating units, was added to the water-soluble, glucan-producing dextransucrase. Trace amounts of 4-linked Glcp were also detected in the dextran obtained from the B-512F culture supernatant, in dextran produced by dextransucrase purified from the B-512F strain culture supernatant, and in clinical dextran. The results of glycosyl-linkage composition analysis suggest that dextransucrases produce 4-linked Glcp as well as 6- and 3-linked Glcp.
TI  - Novel quantitative assays for estimating the antimicrobial activity of fresh garlic juice.
AB  - Novel agar diffusion and broth dilution assays were developed for quantitatively  estimating the antimicrobial activity of fresh garlic juice. Bacteria found to be inhibited by garlic juice in agar diffusion assay included two gram-positive and five gram-negative species. Leuconostoc mesenteroides was not inhibited. Escherichia coli B-103 (HB101, with pJH101, ampicillin resistant, 100 microg ml(-1)) was inhibited and chosen as the standard culture for quantitative assays. The agar diffusion assay was based on the slope ratio method, where the slope of dose response for garlic juice was divided by the slope of dose response for methylmethane thiosulfonate (MMTSO2). Juice from fresh garlic varied in activity between 1.76 and 2.31 microg of MMTSO2 per mg of garlic juice. The activity of juice decreased during 11 months of storage of garlic cloves at 5 degrees C from 2.31 to less than 0.1 microg of MMTSO2 per mg of juice. The broth dilution assay also used the E. coli B-103 culture, which permitted selective enumeration of this bacterium when 100 microg ml(-1) of ampicillin was incorporated into the enumerating agar. Selective enumeration was essential since the garlic juice was not sterile and, thus, contained natural flora. Growth of E. coli was unaffected by 0.1%, delayed by 0.25%, and completely inhibited at 0.5 and 2% garlic juice in broth during 24 h of incubation at 37 micro C. The minimum inhibition concentration of garlic juice by broth dilution assay was, thus, estimated to be 0.5%, which is equivalent to 3.46 microg of MMTSO2 per mg of garlic juice by the agar diffusion assay.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of rosemary extracts.
AB  - A rosemary extract commercially exploited (Oxy'less) as an antioxidant of lipids  in foods was dissolved in ethanol (100 mg/ml), and the solution was tested against foodborne microorganisms. For gram-positive bacteria, the MIC of the ethanolic solution was 1% for Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 0.5% for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.5% for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.13% for Streptococcus mutans, and 0.06% for Bacillus cereus. It slowed the growth of Penicillium roquefortii and Botrytis cinerea. Up to 1% of the ethanolic solution had no activity on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Erwinia carotovora and on the yeasts Rhodotorula glutinis and Cryptococcus laurentii. Antibacterial activity of the rosemary extract was strongly influenced by the composition of the media. The MIC was reduced by low pH, high NaCl contents, and low temperatures. Low pH and high NaCl concentration had a synergistic effect on the MIC of the rosemary extract for S. aureus. Lipids, surface-active agents, and some proteins decreased its antibacterial activity, whereas pectin had no effect. The inhibitory effect was little modified by heat treatment (100 degrees C). The natural microflora of pasteurized zucchini broth was inhibited by 0.5% of the rosemary extract. The antibacterial activity was linked to the compounds extracted with hexane, which are presumably phenolic diterpenoids.
TI  - Surface application of lysozyme, nisin, and EDTA to inhibit spoilage and pathogenic bacteria on ham and bologna.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine if the effectiveness of an antimicrobial treatment for cooked ham and bologna would be increased or maintained when applied in a surface coating. Cooked 10-g disks of ham and bologna sausage received one of three treatments: no coating (control), coating with 0.2 g of 7% (wt/vol) gelatin gel (gel-control), or coating with 0.2 g of 7% gelatin gel containing 25.5 g/liter of lysozyme-nisin (1:3) plus 25.5 g/liter of EDTA (gel-treated). The samples were then inoculated with one of six test organisms: Brochothrix thermosphacta, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Listeria monocytogenes, or Salmonella Typhimurium. Inoculated samples were vacuum packed and stored at 8 degrees C for 4 weeks. The antimicrobial gel treatment had an immediate bactericidal effect up to 4 log CFU/cm2 on the four gram-positive organisms tested (B. thermosphacta, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Listeria monocytogenes) and inhibited the growth of these organisms during the 4 weeks of storage. The antimicrobial gel treatment also had a bactericidal effect on the growth of Salmonella Typhimurium during storage. The numbers of E. coli O157:H7 on ham were reduced by 2 log CFU/cm2 following treatment with both antimicrobial-containing and non-antimicrobial-containing gels during the 4-week storage period. No effect was observed on the growth of E. coli O157:H7 on bologna.
TI  - Enzymes of vancomycin resistance: the structure of D-alanine-D-lactate ligase of  naturally resistant Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial cell wall and the enzymes that synthesize it are targets of glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycins and teicoplanins) and beta-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins). Biosynthesis of cell wall peptidoglycan requires a crosslinking of peptidyl moieties on adjacent glycan strands. The D-alanine-D-alanine transpeptidase, which catalyzes this crosslinking, is the target of beta-lactam antibiotics. Glycopeptides, in contrast, do not inhibit an enzyme, but bind directly to D-alanine-D-alanine and prevent subsequent crosslinking by the transpeptidase. Clinical resistance to vancomycin in enterococcal pathogens has been traced to altered ligases producing D-alanine-D-lactate rather than D-alanine-D-alanine. RESULTS: The structure of a D-alanine-D-lactate ligase has been determined by multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing to 2.4 A resolution. Co-crystallization of the Leuconostoc mesenteroides LmDdl2 ligase with ATP and a di-D-methylphosphinate produced ADP and a phosphinophosphate analog of the reaction intermediate of cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Comparison of this D-alanine-D-lactate ligase with the known structure of DdlB D-alanine-D-alanine ligase, a wild-type enzyme that does not provide vancomycin resistance, reveals alterations in the size and hydrophobicity of the site for D-lactate binding (subsite 2). A decrease was noted in the ability of the ligase to hydrogen bond a substrate molecule entering subsite 2. CONCLUSIONS: Structural differences at subsite 2 of the D-alanine-D-lactate ligase help explain a substrate specificity shift (D-alanine to D-lactate) leading to remodeled cell wall peptidoglycan and vancomycin resistance in Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Mutagenesis of asp-569 of glucosyltransferase I glucansucrase modulates glucan and oligosaccharide synthesis.
AB  - Glucansucrases of oral streptococci and Leuconostoc mesenteroides are enzymes of  medical and biotechnological interest that synthesize alpha-glucans. They can also synthesize oligosaccharides in the presence of a sugar acceptor. Previous reports have identified an amino acid residue that may affect the structure of the glucan product; therefore, random mutagenesis of the corresponding Asp-569 of Streptococcus downei glucosyltransferase I (GTF-I) was used to further understanding of its involvement in the catalytic mechanism and to evaluate how different amino acids can modulate glucan and oligosaccharide synthesis. GTF-I variants were obtained where Asp-569 was replaced by each of the different possible classes of amino acids. These were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by means of a His(6) tag. The results showed that the amino acid in position 569 influences the structure of the glucan and the size of the oligosaccharides produced by GTF-I. The results suggest that the amino acid occupying this position is more likely to interact with the acceptor molecules (oligosaccharides or elongating glucan chain) than to be directly involved in glucosyl transfer from sucrose. Engineering of the equivalent position in glucansucrases thus appears to be a good target to expand the range of oligosaccharides synthesized.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the gene encoding alternansucrase, a sucrose glucosyltransferase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1355.
AB  - The gene encoding alternansucrase (ASR) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1355, an original sucrose glucosyltransferase (GTF) specific to alternating alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic bond synthesis, was cloned, sequenced and expressed into Escherichia coli. Recombinant enzyme catalyzed oligoalternan synthesis from sucrose and maltose acceptor. From sequence comparison, it appears that ASR possesses the same domains as those described for GTFs specific to either contiguous alpha-1,3 osidic bond or contiguous alpha-1,6 osidic bond synthesis. However, the variable region and the glucan binding domain are longer than in other GTFs (by 100 and 200 amino acids respectively). The N-catalytic domain which presents 49% identity with the other GTFs from L. mesenteroides possesses the three determinants potentially involved in the glucosyl enzyme formation.
TI  - Comparison of partial malolactic enzyme gene sequences for phylogenetic analysis  of some lactic acid bacteria species and relationships with the malic enzyme.
AB  - DNA sequences covering 36% of the mle gene that encodes the malolactic enzyme were determined for 13 strains of lactic acid bacteria, representing Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus and Oenococcus genera. The sequences were aligned with the corresponding region of mleS in Lactococcus lactis. The phylogenetic distance matrix tree of all mle sequences was compared with the 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree. The analysis showed that the mle fragment evolved more rapidly than the 16S gene and differently. Pediococcus and Lactobacillus species were intermixed in the 16S rRNA tree whereas they were separated in the mle tree. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Oenococcus oeni were distinct from other species in the 16S rRNA tree, whereas they were intermixed with Lactobacillus species and Lactococcus lactis in the mle tree. The amino acid sequences deduced from partial mle genes were aligned with 22 malic enzyme sequences and the corresponding phylogenetic tree was constructed. Malic and malolactic enzymes were distinct at the phylogenetic level, except for malic enzymes of yeast and Escherichia coli which were nearer the malolactic enzymes than the other malic enzymes. The analysis of conserved sites showed several interesting amino acids specific to either malic enzyme or malolactic enzyme.
TI  - Characterization of pFR18, a small cryptic plasmid from Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides FR52, and its use as a food grade vector.
AB  - A 1.8-kb cryptic plasmid pFR18 was isolated from Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides FR52 and characterized. The identification of single-stranded DNA intermediate (ssDNA) in Leuconostoc demonstrated that the replication of pFR18 is directed by a rolling-circle mechanism (RCR). Sequence analysis revealed a single open reading frame (rep18) encoding a putative 335-amino acid protein homologous to the pT181 replicase. Furthermore, a putative double strand origin similar to that of the pT181 plasmid family was identified. A cloning vector was developed on the basis of the pFR18 replicon by inserting an erythromycin resistance cassette within a non-essential region of the plasmid. The resulting construction was able to transform Lactobacillus sake and various species of Leuconostoc. It was stable in L. mesenteroides, however, the segregational stability of a pFR18 derivative containing large Escherichia coli DNA fragments was affected. Nevertheless, the new RCR plasmid pFR18 may be useful for the construction of food grade vectors.
TI  - Cloning of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis genes and assays of alpha-acetolactate synthase activities in Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris.
AB  - A genomic library from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (Lmc) in Escherichia coli was screened for alpha-acetolactate synthase (ALS) activity using a phenotypic test detecting the production of acetolactate or related C4 derivatives (diacetyl, acetoin or 2,3-butanediol) in the culture. Four recombinant E. coli clones, with plasmids containing overlapping DNA fragments and displaying anabolic ALS activity, were selected. This activity is encoded by an ilvB gene belonging to a putative operon which contains genes highly similar to the genes of the branched chain amino acid (BCAA) operon of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. This putative BCAA operon is not functional as the ilvA gene is interrupted by a single mutation and the strain is auxotrophic for the three BCAAs. Only a very low anabolic ALS activity was present in cell-free extracts of Lmc and no transcript from the ilvB gene could be detected. Instability of ilvB expression in E. coli was the consequence of a frequent IS5 insertion sequence in this gene. Despite the detection of a high catabolic ALS activity in Lmc, no catabolic ALS activity gene could be found in the BCAA gene locus, indicating the presence of a catabolic als gene in the Lmc chromosome that could be absent or not expressed in the screened library.
TI  - Effect of elevated oxygen and carbon dioxide on the surface growth of vegetable-associated micro-organisms.
AB  - The impact of a novel type of Modified Atmosphere (MA), referred to as high O2-MA, on micro-organisms associated with the spoilage of minimally-processed vegetables was studied. Pure cultures of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterobacter agglomerans, Aureobacterium strain 27, Candida guilliermondii, C. sake, Salmonella typhimurium, Salm. enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Leuconostoc mesenteroides var. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis were cultured on an agar-surface model system and incubated at 8 degrees C under an atmosphere composed of O2 (80 or 90%, balanced with N2), CO2 (10 or 20%, balanced with N2), or a combination of both gases. In general, exposure to high O2 alone did not inhibit microbial growth strongly, while CO2 alone reduced growth to some extent in most cases. Consistently strong inhibition was observed only when the two gases were used in combination. With minimally-processed vegetables, where CO2 levels of around 20% or above cannot be used because of physiological damage to the produce, the combined treatment of high O2 and 10-20% CO2 may provide adequate suppression of microbial growth, allowing a safe, prolonged shelf-life.
TI  - Heterologous expression of the bacteriocin mesentericin Y105 using the dedicated  transport system and the general secretion pathway.
AB  - Two different N-terminal extensions have been identified within class II bacteriocin precursors. The first one is a two-glycine-type leader peptide associated with a dedicated ATP-binding cassette transporter. The second is a signal peptide which directs the bacteriocin precursor to the general secretion machinery. Mesentericin Y105 is a class II anti-Listeria bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides Y105 via a dedicated transport system (DTS). To investigate heterologous expression systems capable of producing mesentericin Y105 in various hosts, two different secretion vectors were constructed. One of them, containing the mesentericin Y105 structural gene fused to the segment encoding the divergicin A signal peptide, was introduced into Escherichia coli, Leuconostoc subsp. and Lactococcus subsp. In E. coli, mesentericin Y105 production was linked to a putative periplasmic toxicity. To take advantage of this secretion system, the mesentericin Y105 precursor was also produced in E. coli. It was demonstrated that this pre-bacteriocin exhibited some antagonistic activity against Listeria. To allow for a comparison between the two different transport systems, mesentericin Y105 production using the vector containing the mesentericin Y105 structural gene and its DTS transporter operon was examined. The production of mesentericin Y105 was monitored by a new fast purification method followed by MS analysis. It was shown that, in Leuconostoc, the production of mesentericin Y105 is enhanced via the DTS compared to the general secretion pathway.
TI  - Interaction of hydrostatic pressure, time and temperature of pressurization and pediocin AcH on inactivation of foodborne bacteria.
AB  - High hydrostatic pressure, because it can kill microorganisms, is being investigated for potential use as a nonthermal food preservation method. The objective of this study was to determine the hydrostatic pressurization parameters, pressure, time, and temperature, and a bacteriocin that in combination would destroy 7 to 8 log cycles of pathogenic and spoilage bacterial populations. We suspended cells of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Lactobacillus sake, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Serratia liquefaciens, and Pseudomonas fluorescens in peptone solution and exposed them to the combination of treatments. The combined parameters used were hydrostatic pressure (138 to 345 MPa), time (5 to 15 min), temperature (25 to 50 degrees C), and pediocin AcH (3,000 AU/ml, final concentration). In general, cell death increased as the pressure, time, or temperature increased; however, the cells developed proportionately greater sensitivity as the pressure increased to 276 MPa and higher and the temperature increased above 35 degrees C. Pressurization for longer than 5 min, especially at lower pressure and temperature ranges, had very little added benefit. Among the four gram-negative species, E. coli O157:H7 was the most resistant to pressurization while among the four gram-positive species, L. sake and L. mesenteroides had greater resistance. The death rate at high pressure (345 MPa) and high temperature (50 degrees C) in combination followed first-order kinetics; at lower pressure and temperature combination it showed a late tailing effect. Estimated D value data indicated that even at 345 MPa and 50 degrees C an 8-log-cycle viability loss could not be achieved within 5 min for all eight species. However, when pediocin AcH was included during pressurization this loss was achieved.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of pediocin AcH chimeric protein mutants with altered bactericidal activity.
AB  - A collection of pediocin AcH amino acid substitution mutants was generated by PCR random mutagenesis of DNA encoding the bacteriocin. Mutants were isolated by cloning mutagenized DNA into an Escherichia coli malE plasmid that directs the secretion of maltose binding protein-pediocin AcH chimeric proteins and by screening transformant colonies for bactericidal activity against Lactobacillus plantarum NCDO955 (K. W. Miller, R. Schamber, Y. Chen, and B. Ray, 1998. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 64:14-20, 1998). In all, 17 substitution mutants were isolated at 14 of the 44 amino acids of pediocin AcH. Seven mutants (N5K, C9R, C14S, C14Y, G37E, G37R, and C44W) were completely inactive against the pediocin AcH-sensitive strains L. plantarum NCDO955, Listeria innocua Lin11, Enterococcus faecalis M1, Pediococcus acidilactici LB42, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides Ly. A C24S substitution mutant constructed by other means also was inactive against these bacteria. Nine other mutants (K1N, W18R, I26T, M31T, A34D, N41K, H42L, K43N, and K43E) retained from <1% to approximately 60% of wild-type activity when assayed against L. innocua Lin11. One mutant, K11E, displayed approximately 2. 8-fold-higher activity against this indicator. About one half of the mutations mapped to amino acids that are conserved in the pediocin-like family of bacteriocins. All four cysteines were found to be required for activity, although only C9 and C14 are conserved among pediocin-like bacteriocins. Several basic amino acids as well as nonpolar amino acids located within the hydrophobic C-terminal region also were found to be important. The mutations are discussed in the context of structural models that have been proposed for the bacteriocin.
TI  - A sensitive equilibrium-based assay for D-lactate using D-lactate dehydrogenase:  application to penicillin-binding protein/DD-carboxypeptidase activity assays.
AB  - An assay for D-lactate (D-Lac) is described where D-Lac in the presence of NAD+ is equilibrated to NADH and pyruvate (Pyr) by Leuconostoc mesenteroides D-lactate dehydrogenase (DLDH). This assay was standardized using known concentrations of D-Lac and a linearized form of the equilibrium expression. The assay has a lower limit of about 20 microM D-Lac in a 1 ml assay mixture (20 nmol D-Lac). As a demonstration of this assay method it is used to characterize the hydrolysis of the standard penicillin-binding protein/DD-carboxypeptidase substrate Ac2-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Lac by penicillin-binding protein 5 from Escherichia coli. The approach adopted here of using an inherently nonlinear response, which however follows precisely determinable physical behavior, has the advantages of providing a wider dynamic range and increased relative precision over analogous linear response-based methods. This approach may be applicable to the development of other enzyme-based assay methods.
TI  - Interaction of monolaurin, eugenol and sodium citrate on growth of common meat spoilage and pathogenic organisms.
AB  - Interactions of monolaurin, eugenol (phenolic compound) and sodium citrate (chelator) on the growth of six organisms including common meat spoilage (Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sake, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Brochothrix thermosphacta) and pathogenic (Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes) organisms were investigated. The combinations of 100 to 250 ppm monolaurin with 500 and 1000 ppm eugenol, and 0.2 and 0.4% sodium citrate were more effective than each component separately. More than one combination prevented detectable growth of each organism. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and E. coli O157:H7 were most resistant and L. monocytogenes and B. thermosphacta most sensitive to control by the chosen combinations. The presence of sodium citrate was necessary to yield potent inhibition of Lb. curvatus and Lb. sake growth by the monolaurin and eugenol combinations.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a gene coding for an extracellular dextransucrase (DSRB) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 synthesizing only a alpha (1-6) glucan.
AB  - The coding region for a novel Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 dextransucrase gene (dsrB) was isolated and sequenced. Using degenerate primers homologous to a conserved region present in dextransucrases from Streptococcus (GTFs) and L. mesenteroides NRRL B-512F (DSRS) and conserved amino acid sequences located in the N-terminal catalytic region of these enzymes, about 60% of the DSRB encoding gene was isolated. Two sites, BamHI and HindIII, were identified which allowed one 0.5-kbp probe to be obtained to isolate the 5' and the 3' ends of dsrB. The nucleotide sequence of the dsrB gene was determined and found to consist of an open reading frame (ORF) of 4521 base pairs (bp) coding for a 1507-amino acid protein with an M1 of 168,511. The amino acid sequence is very close to that of DSRS. Like DSRS, the dextran produced appeared to be composed of only alpha (1-6) glucosidic bonds, and the oligosaccharides synthesized in the presence of acceptor maltose were also composed of alpha (1-6) linked glucosyl residues in addition to the maltosyl residue. DSRB thus appears to be a novel dextransucrase from L. mesenteroides NRRL B-1299. DSRB produces a dextran different from the typical dextran containing alpha (1-6) and alpha (1-2) linkages produced when this strain is grown in the presence of sucrose.
TI  - Purification of Leuconostoc mesenteroides citrate lyase and cloning and characterization of the citCDEFG gene cluster.
AB  - A citrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.6) was purified 25-fold from Leuconostoc mesenteroides  and was shown to contain three subunits. The first 42 amino acids of the beta subunit were identified, as well as an internal peptide sequence spanning some 20 amino acids into the alpha subunit. Using degenerated primers from these sequences, we amplified a 1.2-kb DNA fragment by PCR from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris. This fragment was used as a probe for screening a Leuconostoc genomic bank to identify the structural genes. The 2.7-kb gene cluster encoding citrate lyase of L. mesenteroides is organized in three open reading frames, citD, citE, and citF, encoding, respectively, the three citrate lyase subunits gamma (acyl carrier protein [ACP]), beta (citryl-S-ACP lyase; EC 4.1.3.34), and alpha (citrate:acetyl-ACP transferase; EC 2.8.3.10). The gene (citC) encoding the citrate lyase ligase (EC 6.2.1.22) was localized in the region upstream of citD. Protein comparisons show similarities with the citrate lyase ligase and citrate lyase of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Downstream of the citrate lyase cluster, a 1.4-kb open reading frame encoding a 52-kDa protein was found. The deduced protein is similar to CitG of the other bacteria, and its function remains unknown. Expression of the citCDEFG gene cluster in Escherichia coli led to the detection of a citrate lyase activity only in the presence of acetyl coenzyme A, which is a structural analog of the prosthetic group. This shows that the acetyl-ACP group of the citrate lyase form in E. coli is not complete or not linked to the protein.
TI  - Characterization of Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F dextransucrase (DSRS) and identification of amino-acid residues playing a key role in enzyme activity.
AB  - Dextransucrase (DSRS) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F is a glucosyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of soluble dextran from sucrose or oligosaccharides when acceptor molecules, like maltose, are present. The L. mesenteroides NRRL B-512F dextransucrase-encoding gene (dsrS) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned in an overexpression plasmid. The characteristics of DSRS were found to be similar to the characteristics of the extracellular dextransucrase produced by L. mesenteroides NRRL B-512F. The enzyme also exhibited a high homology with other glucosyltransferases. In order to identify critical amino acid residues, the DSRS sequence was aligned with glucosyltransferase sequences and four amino acid residues were selected for site-directed mutagenesis experiments: aspartic acid 511, aspartic acid 513, aspartic acid 551 and histidine 661. Asp-511, Asp-513 and Asp-551 were independently replaced with asparagine and His-661 with arginine. Mutation at Asp-511 and Asp-551 completely suppressed dextran and oligosaccharide synthesis activities, showing that at least two carboxyl groups (Asp-511 and Asp-551) are essential for the catalysis process. However, glucan-binding properties were retained, showing that DSRS has a two-domain structure like other glucosyltransferases. Mutations at Asp-513 and His-661 resulted in greatly reduced dextransucrase activity. According to amino acid sequence alignments of glucosyltransferases, alpha-amylases or cyclodextrin glucanotransferases, His-661 may have a hydrogen-bonding function.
TI  - Effects of the kinetics of water potential variation on bacteria viability.
AB  - The effect of the kinetics of water potential variation (psi) on the viability of bacteria subjected to hyperosmotic stresses in water-glycerol solution was studied. The three bacteria used were Lactobacillus plantarum L-73, Leuconostoc mesenteroides LM057 and Escherichia coli TG1. These strains were submitted to a final water potential of -107.2 MPa, -170.9 MPa and/or -244.7 MPa. In any case the kinetics of water potential variation was found to have a great effect on the cell viability. The application of slow water potential decreases could maintain an important cell viability (about 80-100%) with regard to the corresponding viability observed after a sudden step change for the same final water potential (15-57%). For each strain tested, an optimal dehydration kinetics was determined which depended on the final water potential. The existence of this optimum could be explained thanks to the opposition of two actions affecting cell viability: a positive action relative to the slowness of the water potential variation and a negative action relative to the residence time of cells in a critical range of water potential.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a gene coding for a novel dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 synthesizing only alpha (1-6) and alpha (1-3) linkages.
AB  - The coding region for a Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 dextransucrase gene (dsrA) was isolated and sequenced. Using a pair of primers designed on the basis of two highly conserved amino-acid (aa) sequences in L. mesenteroides NRRL B-512F dextransucrase and streptococcal glucosyltransferases (GTFs), a fragment of dsrA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This PCR product was used as an hybridization probe to isolate a 1.8-kb fragment identified as the central region of dsrA. Cleavage by Sac I of this fragment allowed two probes to be obtained to isolate the 5' and the 3' ends of dsrA. The nucleotide sequence of the dsrA gene was determined and found to consist of an open reading frame (ORF) of 4870 base pairs (bp) coding for a 1290-aa protein with an M(r) of 145590. The aa sequence exhibited a high similarity with other GTFs. The two domains previously described in GTFs are conserved in DSRA: an N-terminal conserved domain and a C-terminal domain composed of a series of repeats. Surprisingly, the expected signal peptide was not detected. The entire gene was reconstructed and the activity of DSRA was investigated. The dextran produced appeared to be composed of 85% alpha (1-6) and 15% alpha (1-3) linkages and the oligosaccharides synthesized in the presence of maltose were mainly composed of alpha (1-6) linkages. This enzyme is a novel dextransucrase from L. mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 producing no alpha (1-2) linkages and is the first glucosyltransferase having no signal peptide described.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of sucrose phosphorylase gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides No. 165.
AB  - The sucrose phosphorylase gene of an isolate, Leuconostoc mesenteroides No. 165,  was amplified by PCR, cloned on pUC118, and expressed in E. coli. The nucleotide sequence of the gene showed 96.3% similarity to that of L. mesenteroides ATCC12291 and 67% to that of Streptococcus mutans, but low similarity to the Agrobacterium vitis gene. The cloned gene, which fusing with lacZalpha, was expressed inducibly with IPTG in E. coli to produce an active enzyme in large quantities that accounted for about 50% of the total cell protein.
TI  - Expression of DnaK and GroEL homologs in Leuconostoc esenteroides in response to  heat shock, cold shock or chemical stress.
AB  - The mechanism of adaptation of bacteria to survive at elevated temperature in the human host and the expression of heat-shock proteins in response to stress was examined by labelling with [35S]methionine. An increase in culture temperature from 26 degrees C to 37 degrees C induced expression of certain bacterial proteins (70 and 60 kDa). Heat shock at 40 degrees C, cold shock (10 degrees C), ethanol treatment or arsenite treatment also led to an increased expression of heat shock proteins of 70 and 60 kDa. Actinomycin D completely blocked the induction, indicating that transcription is required for the overexpression of stress proteins in Leuconostoc mesenteroides. N-terminal sequence analysis showed that these proteins were homologous to the highly conserved chaperone proteins DnaK and GroEL of Escherichia coli, respectively.
TI  - Cloning and partial characterization of regulated promoters from Lactococcus lactis Tn917-lacZ integrants with the new promoter probe vector, pAK80.
AB  - Transposon Tn917-LTV1 was used to produce a collection of Lactococcus lactis strains with fusion of a promoterless lacZ gene to chromosomal loci. Screening 2,500 Tn917-LTV1 integrants revealed 222 that express beta-galactosidase on plates at 30 degrees C. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed Tn917-LTV1 insertions in at least 13 loci in 15 strains analyzed. Integrants in which beta-galactosidase expression was regulated by temperature or pH and/or arginine concentration were isolated. In most cases, the regulation observed on plates was reproducible in liquid medium. One integrant, PA170, produces beta-galactosidase at pH 5.2 but not at pH 7.0, produces more beta-galactosidase at 15 degrees C than at 30 degrees C, and has increased beta-galactosidase activity in the stationary phase. DNA fragments potentially carrying promoters from selected Lactococcus lactis integrants were cloned in Escherichia coli. A new promoter probe vector, pAK80, containing promoterless beta-galactosidase genes from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris and the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis citrate plasmid replication region was constructed, and the lactococcal fragments were inserted. Plasmid pAK80 was capable of detecting and discriminating even weak promoters in Lactococcus lactis. When inserted in pAK80, the promoter cloned from PA170 displayed a regulated expression of beta-galactosidase analogous to the regulation observed in PA170.
TI  - Purification, properties and DNA sequence of the D-lactate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris.
AB  - The complete sequence of the D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-ldh) gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, cloned in Escherichia coli, were determined. The deduced amino acid sequence showed homologies with all members of the D-specific-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family. Furthermore, the essential residues detected so far as being involved in catalysis were also conserved. Purification of the enzyme revealed physico-chemical properties corresponding to those predicted from the sequence. The active enzyme was a dimer of 40-kDa subunits. The Km values for pyruvate, lactate, NADH and NAD were 0.3, 19, 0.03 and 0.16 mM, indicating that the enzyme reduced pyruvate in vivo. Besides the D-LDH activity, L. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris also displayed HicDH enzymatic activity, catalysing the reduction of pyruvate analogs. The purified D-LDH displayed low HicDH-type activity; therefore, differences in specificity profiles between the crude extract and the purified enzyme suggested the occurrence of a specific HicDH.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of IS1181, an insertion sequence from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The repeated nucleotide sequence isolated from a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolate displays the characteristic features of an insertion sequence and was named IS1181. It has a size of 1512 bp and consists of a 1359-bp open reading frame that encodes a 439-amino-acid protein which is predicted to be highly basic and 23-bp terminal inverted complementary repeated sequences exhibiting six mismatches. The three copies of IS1181 isolated from distinct parts of the chromosome of S. aureus, BM3121, are flanked at their ends by 8-bp direct repeats, suggesting a duplication of the target sequence. IS1181 exhibits similarities with IS1165 from Leuconostoc mesenteroides and IS1001 from Bordetella parapertusis. IS1181 was detected in at least two to eight copies in 41 of the 52 S. aureus isolates tested, whereas none of the 26 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 24 streptococci, or 11 enterococci analyzed carried nucleotide sequences hybridizing with IS1181.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of shredded carrot extracts on food-borne bacteria and yeast.
AB  - Purified ethanolic extracts of peeled and shredded carrots showed an antimicrobial effect against a range of food-borne micro-organisms. The minimum inhibitory concentration, expressed as mg ml-1 dried carrot material used for the extraction were: Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 27; Listeria monocytogenes, > 27 < 55; Staphylococcus aureus, > 27 < 55; Pseudomonas fluorescens, > 55 < 110; Candida lambica, > 55 < 110; Escherichia coli, > 110 < 220. The antimicrobial activity was not linked to phenolic compounds but was presumably due to apolar components. Free saturated fatty acid (dodecanoic acid) and methyl esters of saturated fatty acids (of dodecanoic and pentadecanoic acids) were identified in purified active extracts of carrots by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and could be responsible for the antimicrobial activity. This effect did not seem to play a role in the resistance of shredded carrots to microbial spoilage, although the antimicrobial activity was present in fresh carrots at concentrations sufficient to inhibit spoilage bacteria.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis to facilitate X-ray structural studies of Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
AB  
TI  - Lysine-21 of Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase participates in substrate binding through charge-charge interaction.
AB  - Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was isolated in high yield and purified to homogeneity from a newly constructed strain of Escherichia coli which lacks its own glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. Lys-21 is one of two lysyl residues in the enzyme previously modified by the affinity labels pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxal 5'-diphosphate-5'-adenosine, which are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme with respect to glucose 6-phosphate (LaDine, J.R., Carlow, D., Lee, W.T., Cross, R.L., Flynn, T.G., & Levy, H.R., 1991, J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5558-5562). K21R and K21Q mutants of the enzyme were purified to homogeneity and characterized kinetically to determine the function of Lys-21. Both mutant enzymes showed increased Km-values for glucose 6-phosphate compared to wild-type enzyme: 1.4-fold (NAD-linked reaction) and 2.1-fold (NADP-linked reaction) for the K21R enzyme, and 36-fold (NAD-linked reaction) and 53-fold (NADP-linked reaction) for the K21Q enzyme. The Km for NADP+ was unchanged in both mutant enzymes. The Km for NAD+ was increased 1.5- and 3.2-fold, compared to the wild-type enzyme, in the K21R and K21Q enzymes, respectively. For the K21R enzyme the kcat for the NAD- and NADP-linked reactions was unchanged. The kcat for the K21Q enzyme was increased in the NAD-linked reaction by 26% and decreased by 30% in the NADP-linked reaction from the values for the wild-type enzyme. The data are consistent with Lys-21 participating in the binding of the phosphate group of the substrate to the enzyme via charge-charge interaction.
TI  - Branched-Chain Amino Acid Transport in Cytoplasmic Membranes of Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum CNRZ 1273.
AB  - Membrane vesicles of Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum fused with proteoliposomes prepared from Escherichia coli phospholipids containing beef heart cytochrome c oxidase were used to study the transport of branched-chain amino acids in a strain isolated from a raw milk cheese. At a medium pH of 6.0, oxidation of an electron donor system comprising ascorbate, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, and horse heart cytochrome c resulted in a membrane potential (Deltapsi) of -60 mV, a pH gradient of -36 mV, and an l-leucine accumulation of 76-fold (Deltamu(Leu)/F = 108 mV). Leucine uptake in hybrid membranes in which a Deltapsi, DeltapH, sodium ion gradient, or a combination of these was imposed artificially revealed that both components of the proton motive force (Deltap) could drive leucine uptake but that a chemical sodium gradient could not. Kinetic analysis of leucine (valine) transport indicated three secondary transport systems with K(t) values of 1.7 (0.8) mM, 4.3 (5.9) muM, and 65 (29) nM, respectively. l-Leucine transport via the high-affinity leucine transport system (K(t) = 4.3 muM) was competitively inhibited by l-valine and l-isoleucine (K(i) and K(t) values were similar), demonstrating that the transport system translocates branched-chain amino acids. Similar studies with these hybrid membranes indicated the presence of high-affinity secondary transport systems for 10 other amino acids.
TI  - Molecular basis for vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium BM4147: biosynthesis of a depsipeptide peptidoglycan precursor by vancomycin resistance proteins VanH and VanA.
AB  - Vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium BM4147 is mediated by vancomycin resistance proteins VanA and VanH. VanA is a D-alanine:D-alanine ligase of altered substrate specificity [Bugg, T. D. H., Dutka-Malen, S., Arthur, M., Courvalin, P., & Walsh, C. T. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 2017-2021], while the sequence of VanH is related to those of alpha-keto acid dehydrogenases [Arthur, M., Molinas, C., Dutka-Malen, S., & Courvalin, P. (1991) Gene (submitted)]. We report purification of VanH to homogeneity, characterization as a D-specific alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, and comparison with D-lactate dehydrogenases from Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactobacillus leichmanii. VanA was found to catalyze ester bond formation between D-alanine and the D-hydroxy acid products of VanH, the best substrate being D-2-hydroxybutyrate (Km = 0.60 mM). The VanA product D-alanyl-D-2-hydroxybutyrate could then be incorporated into the UDPMurNAc-pentapeptide peptidoglycan precursor by D-Ala-D-Ala adding enzyme from Escherichia coli or by crude extract from E. faecium BM4147. The vancomycin binding constant of a synthetic modified peptidoglycan analogue N-acetyl-D-alanyl-D-2-hydroxybutyrate (Kd greater than 73 mM) was greater than 1000-fold higher than the binding constant for N-acetyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine (Kd = 54 microM), partly due to the disruption of a hydrogen bond in the vancomycin-target complex, thus providing a molecular rationale for high-level vancomycin resistance.
TI  - Cloning of the gene and amino acid sequence for glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
AB  - Amino acid sequencing of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glc6PD) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides yielded sequence for over 75% of the protein. Two oligonucleotides based on the amino acid sequence were used to isolate a partial Glc6PD gene clone (pLmz delta N65), from a pUC9 library, containing 85% of the coding sequence and the 3'-untranslated DNA, but lacking the 5'-noncoding DNA sequence and the portion of the gene encoding the 65 N-terminal amino acids. Attempts to obtain a full-length clone from lambda libraries were unsuccessful, possibly due to restriction of L. mesenteroides DNA by Escherichia coli host cells. The 5'-untranslated DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and partially sequenced. To obtain unmodified DNA for the gene, oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5'- and 3'-noncoding sequences were used to amplify the gene by the polymerase chain reaction, and a 1.8-kilobase pair fragment was isolated and cloned into pUC19. The recombinant plasmid, pLmz, contains the entire Glc6PD gene and expresses the gene in E. coli. pLmz was sequenced showing that the enzyme consists of 485 amino acids. L. mesenteroides Glc6PD is 31% identical to the human enzyme.
TI  - Characterization, cloning, curing, and distribution in lactic acid bacteria of pLP1, a plasmid from Lactobacillus plantarum CCM 1904 and its use in shuttle vector construction.
AB  - A small 2.1-kb plasmid called pLP1 was extracted from Lactobacillus plantarum CCM 1904 (ATCC 8014) and cloned into the Escherichia coli pUC19 plasmid. As determined by DNA-DNA Southern hybridization with a pLP1-radioactively labeled probe, other lactic acid bacteria such as L. curvatus, L. sake, Carnobacterium, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides harbor pLP1-related plasmids. Shuttle vectors based on the pLP1 replicon were constructed by inserting the erythromycin-resistance gene from pVA891 into the various pUC19-pLP1 constructions. pLP1-based shuttle vector transformation efficiencies (TE) by electroporation were compared to TE of a broad-host-range plasmid pGK12 in different lactobacilli strains. Expression of the pUC19-pLP1 plasmids in Escherichia coli maxicells showed that pLP1 encodes for a 37,000 MW protein which can act in trans allowing the replication of plasmids in which this protein is truncated. The pLP1-based shuttle vectors producing this protein replicate in lactobacilli and also in Bacillus subtilis. A pLP1-free strain was obtained by incompatibility with a pLP1-based shuttle vector introduced in L. plantarum CCM 1904 by electroporation. The absence of pLP1 has no incidence on the strain phenotype suggesting that pLP1 is not essential for the strain in our laboratory conditions.
TI  - Expression of the gene for NAD-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides cloned in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - The structural gene (zwf) for Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase has been cloned into Escherichia coli on pBR322 by selecting for complementation of a zwf mutation of E. coli which eliminates glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The gene has been subcloned on a 3.4-kilobase DNA segment. The encoded glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase displays the dual nucleotide specificity (reacting with NAD and NADP) of the L. mesenteroides enzyme and has a subunit Mr of 55,000. A second gene encoding protein of subunit Mr 24,000 is also encoded on the 3.4-kilobase DNA segment. The genes have been located by the analysis of deletions and insertions generated in vitro and by transcriptional mapping with a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl transferase cartridge inserted at different sites in the 3.4-kilobase fragment.
TI  - Effect of dextran-S (alpha, 1-3 dextran) on the growth of plasmacytomas MOPC-104E and J558.
AB  - The murine plasmacytomas MOPC-104E and J558 secrete IgM-lambda and IgA-lambda, respectively, which are antibodies to alpha, 1-3 dextran, a constituent of dextran-S (DEX-S) extracted from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. A single i.p. injection of 10 microgram DEX-S into BALB/c mice from 7 days before and up to 3 days after the implantation of 5 x 10(3) plasmacytoma cells protected the BALB/c mice from developing the tumors. Immunization with other antigens, such as Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, inulin (alpha, 1-6 linkage), and dextran T-10 (no known alpha, 1-3 linkages) did not protect the mice from developing the tumors. Growth of LPC-1 was not affected by DEX-S. The mechanism of this growth inhibition is unknown. It does not appear to depend solely on binding of antigen to tumor cells, and the limits of the effective time intervals between antigen and tumor injection suggest dependence on the presence of antibody to alpha-1,3 dextran.
TI  - On the mechanism and stereochemistry of the malate-lactate fermentation of Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
AB  - During the transformation of (2S, 3R) [3-3H]malate to (S) lactate no tritium exchange takes place. The stereochemical course of the decarboxylation studied with (2S, 3R) [3-2H]-malate in 3HOH/H2O and (2S, 3R) [3-3H]malate in 2H2O occurs with retention and is therefore the same as that determined by other authors for malic enzyme from vertebrates and from Escherichia coli. The malate-lactate fermentation is a useful procedure to prepare chiral methyl groups on a preparative scale starting from (2S, 3R) [3-H]malate.
TI  - A new episomic element controlling fermentative metabolism and excretion of amino acids by Citrobacter intermedium C3.
AB  - Glutamate excretion by colonies of Citrobacter intermedium C3 was detected by using the auxotrophic strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides P-60. A constant ratio of strain C3 colonies did not excrete glutamate. These colonies were subcultured, and colonial analysis of their descendants established that the change from non-excretor to excretor (Sg(-) --> Sg(+)) is a spontaneous and random process with occurs at a high rate, and that an equilibrium state results from the back-transition Sg(+) --> Sg(-) in large populations. Acridine orange, ethidium bromide, and shaking have a strong influence on Sg(+)-to-Sg(-) interconversion, which suggests that a genetic element like an episome is implicated (S factor). Various auxotrophic mutants of bacterial strain C3 have been cured of the S factor. Strains lacking the S factor (S(-) strains) do not excrete glutamate and lose their fermentative metabolism completely. Consequently, the S factor is different from other extrachromosomal genetic factors whose elimination does not modify central metabolism. The gain of the S factor by infectious transfer has been shown with different C3 auxotrophic mutant strains. Also, the S factor has been transferred to Paracolobactrum intermedium ATCC 11606. These findings suggest that phenotypic changes observed are a consequence of elimination or infectious gain of the S factor, with its autonomous or integrated multiplication.
TI  - THE CONTROL OF SULPHATE ACTIVATION IN BACTERIA.
AB  - 1. ATP-sulphate adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.4) and ATP-adenylyl sulphate 3'-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.1.25) of Escherichia coli 9723, E. coli K(12) and Bacillus subtilis 1379 are each repressed by growth in the presence of cystine. Repression of the two enzymes in E. coli 9723 may be co-ordinate. 2. ATP-sulphate adenylyltransferase of Desulphovibrio desulphuricans, in which sulphate reduction is linked to the energy supply of the organism, is not repressed by growth in the presence of inorganic sulphite or cysteine. 3. Leuconostoc mesenteroides lacks all the enzymes between sulphate and cysteine whether grown on cysteine or glutathione.
