TI  - Clostridium sordellii genome analysis reveals plasmid localized toxin genes encoded within pathogenicity loci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium sordellii can cause severe infections in animals and humans, the latter associated with trauma, toxic shock and often-fatal gynaecological infections. Strains can produce two large clostridial cytotoxins (LCCs), TcsL and TcsH, related to those produced by Clostridium difficile, Clostridium novyi and Clostridium perfringens, but the genetic basis of toxin production remains uncharacterised. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of the genome sequences of 44 strains isolated from human and animal infections in the UK, US and Australia placed the species into four clades. Although all strains originated from animal or clinical disease, only 5 strains contained LCC genes: 4 strains contain tcsL alone and one strain contains tcsL and tcsH. Four toxin-positive strains were found within one clade. Where present, tcsL and tcsH were localised in a pathogenicity locus, similar to but distinct from that present in C. difficile. In contrast to C. difficile, where the LCCs are chromosomally localised, the C. sordellii tcsL and tcsH genes are localised on plasmids. Our data suggest gain and loss of entire toxigenic plasmids in addition to horizontal transfer of the pathogenicity locus. A high quality, annotated sequence of ATCC9714 reveals many putative virulence factors including neuraminidase, phospholipase C and the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin sordellilysin that are highly conserved between all strains studied. CONCLUSIONS: Genome analysis of C. sordellii reveals that the LCCs, the major virulence factors, are localised on plasmids. Many strains do not contain the LCC genes; it is probable that in several of these cases the plasmid has been lost upon laboratory subculture. Our data are consistent with LCCs being the primary virulence factors in the majority of infections, but LCC-negative strains may precipitate certain categories of infection. A high quality genome sequence reveals putative virulence factors whose role in virulence can be investigated.
TI  - Characterization of the dynamic germination of individual Clostridium difficile spores using Raman spectroscopy and differential interference contrast microscopy.
AB  - The Gram-positive spore-forming anaerobe Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea. Spores of C. difficile initiate infection when triggered to germinate by bile salts in the gastrointestinal tract. We analyzed germination kinetics of individual C. difficile spores using Raman spectroscopy and differential interference contrast microscopy. Similar to Bacillus spores, individual C. difficile spores germinating with taurocholate plus glycine began slow leakage of approximately 15% of CaDPA at a heterogeneous time T1, rapidly released CaDPA at Tlag, completed CaDPA release at Trelease,and finished peptidoglycan cortex hydrolysis at Tlysis. T1 and Tlag values for individual spores were heterogeneous, but DeltaTrelease periods (Trelease - Tlag) were relatively constant. Unlike Bacillus spores, heat treatment did not stimulate spore germination in the two C. difficile strains tested. C. difficile spores did not germinate with taurocholate or glycine alone, and different bile salts differentially promoted spore germination, with taurocholate and taurodeoxycholate being best. Transient exposure of spores to taurocholate plus glycine was sufficient to commit individual spores to germinate. C. difficile spores did not germinate with CaDPA, in contrast with B. subtilis and C. perfringens spores. However, the detergent dodecylamine induced C. difficile spore germination and rates were increased by spore coat removal, although cortex hydrolysis did not follow Trelease, in contrast with B. subtilis. C. difficile spores lacking the cortex-lytic enzyme, SleC, germinated extremely poorly, and cortex hydrolysis was not observed in the few sleC spores that partially germinated. Overall, these findings indicate that C. difficile and B. subtilis spore germination exhibit key differences. IMPORTANCE: Spores of the Gram-positive, anaerobe Clostridium difficile are responsible for initiating infection by this important nosocomial pathogen. When exposed to germinants such as bile salts, C. difficile spores return to life through germination in the gastrointestinal tract and cause disease, but their germination has only been studied with population-wide measurements. In this work we used Raman spectroscopy and DIC microscopy to monitor the kinetics of germination of individual C. difficile spores, the commitment of spores to germination, and the effect of germinant type and concentration, sublethal heat shock, and spore decoating on germination. Our data suggest that the order of germination events in C. difficile spores differs from Bacillus spores and provide new insights into C. difficile spore germination.
TI  - Effect of a Probiotic on Prevention of Diarrhea and Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens Shedding in Foals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to 60% of foals develop diarrhea within 6 months after birth. Preventive measures are limited but potentially probiotics could be used. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a newly designed probiotic on the incidence of foal diarrhea in a randomized field trial. ANIMALS: Seventy-two healthy neonatal foals. METHODS: Randomized, placebo-controlled field trial. Foals were administered a placebo or probiotic for 3 weeks and monitored for an additional week. A total of 3 fecal samples were taken from each foal at biweekly intervals. Statistical modeling was applied for comparison of incidence and duration of diarrhea and fecal shedding of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile between treatment and age groups. RESULTS: The overall incidence of diarrhea was 41 of 72 (59%) and did not differ (P = 0.37) between treatment groups. Foals treated with probiotics were more likely to develop diarrhea requiring veterinary intervention (P = 0.007). Age had a significant effect on incidence of diarrhea (P < 0.001); foals 8-15 days old having the highest probability of developing diarrhea. Duration of diarrhea and soft feces were not significantly different between groups. The prevalence of C. perfringens shedding was 55% with no difference between treatment groups (P = 0.23). The prevalence of C. difficile shedding was 11%. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: There was no benefit of administering a 3-week course of probiotics, but potential adverse effects were noted. Whether the probiotics lacked a clinical effect, or the choice of strains or dose was inadequate, is unknown. Clostridial shedding was not influenced by probiotics despite in vitro activity of probiotics.
TI  - The catalytic domains of Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin and related large clostridial glucosylating toxins specifically recognize the negatively charged phospholipids phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid.
AB  - Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) is a potent virulence factor belonging  to the large clostridial glucosylating toxin family. TcsL enters target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and delivers the N-terminal catalytic domain (TcsL-cat) into the cytosol upon an autoproteolytic process. TcsL-cat inactivates small GTPases including Rac and Ras by glucosylation with uridine-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose as cofactor leading to drastic changes in cytoskeleton and cell viability. TcsL-cat was found to preferentially bind to phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing membranes and to increase the glucosylation of Rac anchored to lipid membrane. We here report binding affinity measurements of TcsL-cat for brain PS-containing membranes by surface plasmon resonance and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, TcsL-cat bound to phosphatidic acid (PA) and, to a lesser extent, to other anionic lipids, but not to neutral lipids, sphingolipids or sterol. We further show that the lipid unsaturation status influenced TcsL-cat binding to phospholipids, PS with unsaturated acyl chains and PA with saturated acyl chains being the preferred bindingsubstrates. Phospholipid binding site is localized at the N-terminal four helical bundle structure (1-93 domain). However, TcsL-1-93 bound to a broad range of substrates, whereas TcsL-cat, which is the active domain physiologically delivered into the cytosol, selectively bound to PS and PA. Similar findings were observed with the other large clostridial glucosylating toxins from C. difficile, C. novyi and C. perfringens.
TI  - Solution structure and DNA binding of the catalytic domain of the large serine resolvase TnpX.
AB  - The transfer of antibiotic resistance between bacteria is mediated by mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and transposons. TnpX is a member of the large serine recombinase subgroup of site-specific recombinases and is responsible for the excision and insertion of mobile genetic elements that encode chloramphenicol resistance in the pathogens Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile. TnpX consists of three structural domains: domain I contains the catalytic site, whereas domains II and III contain DNA-binding motifs. We have solved the solution structure of residues 1-120 of the catalytic domain I of TnpX. The TnpX catalytic domain shares the same overall fold as other serine recombinases; however, differences are evident in the identity of the proposed hydrogen donor and in the size, amino acid composition, conformation, and dynamics of the TnpX active site loops. To obtain the interaction surface of TnpX1-120 , we titrated a DNA oligonucleotide containing the circular intermediate joint attCI recombination site into (15) N-labeled TnpX1-120 and observed progressive nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift perturbations using (15) N HSQC spectra. Perturbations were largely confined to a region surrounding the catalytic serine and encompassed residues of the active site loops. Utilizing the perturbation map and the data-driven docking program, HADDOCK, we have generated a model of the DNA interaction complex for the TnpX catalytic domain.
TI  - Diverse mechanisms regulate sporulation sigma factor activity in the Firmicutes.
AB  - Sporulation allows bacteria to survive adverse conditions and is essential to the lifecycle of some obligate anaerobes. In Bacillus subtilis, the sporulation-specific sigma factors, sigma(F), sigma(E), sigma(G), and sigma(K), activate compartment-specific transcriptional programs that drive sporulation through its morphological stages. The regulation of these sigma factors was predicted to be conserved across the Firmicutes, since the regulatory proteins controlling their activation are largely conserved. However, recent studies in (Pepto)Clostridium difficile, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum have revealed striking differences in the order, activation, and function of sporulation sigma factors. These studies indicate that gene conservation does not necessarily predict gene function and that new mechanisms for controlling cell fate determination remain to be discovered in the anaerobic Clostridia.
TI  - A possible route for foodborne transmission of Clostridium difficile?
AB  - Spores of toxigenic Clostridium difficile and spores of food-poisoning strains of Clostridium perfringens show a similar prevalence in meats. Spores of both species are heat resistant and can survive cooking of foods. C. perfringens is a major cause of foodborne illness; studies are needed to determine whether C. difficile transmission by a similar route is a cause of infection.
TI  - Spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-Clostridium activity from Actinomadura sp. 2EPS.
AB  - The rare actinomycetes strain 2EPS was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell wall, and 16S rRNA gene sequence indicates that 2EPS belongs to genus Actinomadura. In addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the relationships of this strain to other members of Actinomadura. A butanol extract with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. The structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR) and mass spectrometric analysis (HR-TOF-MS). Compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the Japanese patent number JP 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are BE-45722A (1), BE-45722B (2) and BE-45722C (3), respectively. All compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, and B. subtilis ATCC 6633) with low MIC values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. Moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar MIC values, against Clostridium perfringens S107 at 0.63 microg/ml and C. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. These results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of Clostridium infections. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and Clostridium difficile toxin A/B do not play a role in acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome in dogs.
AB  - Although an association between clostridial pathogens and canine idiopathic acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome (AHDS) has been described, the relevance of those bacteria and their toxins remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between severity of clinical signs and presence of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and Clostridium difficile toxin A/B (CDT A/B) in faeces of dogs with AHDS. Faecal samples of 54 dogs with idiopathic AHDS were tested by qualitative CPE and CDT A/B ELISA, and PCR was performed to detect enterotoxin genes of C. perfringens (cpe) and toxin B genes of C. difficile (cdt b). Prevalence of cdt b and CDT A/B in dogs with AHDS was 10/54 and 2/54 versus 3/23 and 0/23 in control dogs. Prevalence of cpe was 35/54 in affected versus 9/23 in control dogs. Prevalence of CPE in dogs with AHDS (13/54) was higher compared with control dogs (0/23). No significant difference was detected between CPE-positive and -negative and between cpe-positive and -negative dogs in severity of clinical signs, duration of hospitalisation, mortality rate and selected laboratory parameters. This study suggests that CPE and CDT A/B do not play a role in idiopathic AHDS, are not associated with clinical parameters in affected dogs and cannot be used to predict disease outcome.
TI  - Novel receptors for bacterial protein toxins.
AB  - While bacterial effectors are often directly introduced into eukaryotic target cells by various types of injection machines, toxins enter the cytosol of host cells from endosomal compartments or after retrograde transport via Golgi from the ER. A first crucial step of toxin-host interaction is receptor binding. Using optimized protocols and new methods novel toxin receptors have been identified, including metalloprotease ADAM 10 for Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin, laminin receptor Lu/BCAM for Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor CNF1, lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) for Clostridium difficile transferase CDT and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 1 for Clostridium perfringens TpeL toxin.
TI  - Infant botulism: is there an association with thiamine deficiency?
AB  - Infant botulism is an acute life-threatening condition and diagnosis is frequently delayed. Therefore, the best time window to administer specific antibodies, at present the only etiology-based therapy, is often missed, entailing long periods of hospitalization in the PICU. Here we present a 3-month-old boy with infant botulism and respiratory failure, who quickly and favorably responded to thiamine supplementation. From the feces we isolated Clostridium botulinum serotype A2. In addition to producing botulinum neurotoxin A, this strain carried the thiaminase I gene and produced thiaminase I. Accordingly, the child's feces were positive for thiaminase I activity. Because C botulinum group I strains are capable of producing thiaminase I, we speculate that thiamine degradation might further aggravate the paralytic symptoms caused by botulinum neurotoxins in infant botulism. Thus, supportive supplementation with thiamine could be beneficial to speed up recovery and to shorten hospitalization in some patients with infant botulism.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of levornidazole, its metabolites and comparators against clinical anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - This study evaluated the in vitro anti-anaerobic activity and spectrum of levornidazole, its metabolites and comparators against 375 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria, including Gram-negative bacilli (181 strains), Gram-negative cocci (11 strains), Gram-positive bacilli (139 strains) and Gram-positive cocci (44 strains), covering 34 species. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levornidazole, its five metabolites and three comparators against these anaerobic isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of levornidazole and metronidazole were measured against 22 strains of Bacteroides fragilis. Levornidazole showed good activity against B. fragilis, other Bacteroides spp., Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus magnus, evidenced by MIC90 values of 0.5, 1, 0.25, 2 and 1mg/L, respectively. The activity of levornidazole and the comparators was poor for Veillonella spp. Generally, levornidazole displayed activity similar to or slightly higher than that of metronidazole, ornidazole and dextrornidazole against anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive bacilli and Gram-positive cocci, especially B. fragilis. Favourable anti-anaerobic activity was also seen with levornidazole metabolites M1 and M4 but not M2, M3 or M5. For the 22 clinical B. fragilis strains, MBC50 and MBC90 values of levornidazole were 2mg/L and 4mg/L, respectively. Both MBC50/MIC50 and MBC90/MIC90 ratios of levornidazole were 4, similar to those of metronidazole. Levornidazole is an important anti-anaerobic option in clinical settings in terms of its potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity, bactericidal property, and the anti-anaerobic activity of its metabolites M1 and M4.
TI  - Biofilms of Clostridium species.
AB  - The biofilm is a microbial community embedded in a synthesized matrix and is the  main bacterial way of life. A biofilm adheres on surfaces or is found on interfaces. It protects bacteria from the environment, toxic molecules and may have a role in virulence. Clostridium species are spread throughout both environments and hosts, but their biofilms have not been extensively described in comparison with other bacterial species. In this review we describe all biofilms formed by Clostridium species during both industrial processes and in mammals where biofilms may be formed either during infections or associated to microbiota in the gut. We have specifically focussed on Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens biofilms, which have been studied in vitro. Regulatory processes including sporulation and germination highlight how these Clostridium species live in biofilms. Furthermore, biofilms may have a role in the survival and spreading of Clostridium species.
TI  - Clostridium and bacillus binary enterotoxins: bad for the bowels, and eukaryotic  being.
AB  - Some pathogenic spore-forming bacilli employ a binary protein mechanism for intoxicating the intestinal tracts of insects, animals, and humans. These Gram-positive bacteria and their toxins include Clostridium botulinum (C2 toxin), Clostridium difficile (C. difficile toxin or CDT), Clostridium perfringens (iota-toxin and binary enterotoxin, or BEC), Clostridium spiroforme (C. spiroforme toxin or CST), as well as Bacillus cereus (vegetative insecticidal protein or VIP). These gut-acting proteins form an AB complex composed of ADP-ribosyl transferase (A) and cell-binding (B) components that intoxicate cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and endosomal trafficking. Once inside the cytosol, the A components inhibit normal cell functions by mono-ADP-ribosylation of globular actin, which induces cytoskeletal disarray and death. Important aspects of each bacterium and binary enterotoxin will be highlighted in this review, with particular focus upon the disease process involving the biochemistry and modes of action for each toxin.
TI  - Expression of the large clostridial toxins is controlled by conserved regulatory  mechanisms.
AB  - The clostridia cause many human and animal diseases, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Host damage results from the action of potent exotoxins, an important group of which is the large clostridial toxins (LCTs) produced by Clostridium difficile, Clostridium sordellii, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium novyi. Knowledge of the structure and function of these toxins has been attained, however, apart from C. difficile, the regulatory pathways that control LCT production remain largely unknown. Here we show that LCT production in C. sordellii and C. perfringens is temporally regulated and repressed by glucose in a similar manner to C. difficile. Furthermore, we show that the TpeL-encoding gene of C. perfringens is located in an uncharacterized Pathogenicity Locus (PaLoc), along with accessory genes predicted to encode a bacteriophage holin-type protein and a TcdR-family alternative sigma factor, TpeR. Inactivation of tpeR demonstrated that TpeR is critical for C. perfringens TpeL production, in a similar manner to C. difficile TcdR and C. sordellii TcsR, but cross-complementation showed that TpeR is not functionally interchangeable with TcdR or TcsR. Although conserved mechanisms are employed by the clostridia to control LCT production there are important functional differences that distinguish members of the TcdR-family of clostridial alternative sigma factors.
TI  - Iron fortification adversely affects the gut microbiome, increases pathogen abundance and induces intestinal inflammation in Kenyan infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In-home iron fortification for infants in developing countries is recommended for control of anaemia, but low absorption typically results in >80% of the iron passing into the colon. Iron is essential for growth and virulence of many pathogenic enterobacteria. We determined the effect of high and low dose in-home iron fortification on the infant gut microbiome and intestinal inflammation. METHODS: We performed two double-blind randomised controlled trials in 6-month-old Kenyan infants (n=115) consuming home-fortified maize porridge daily for 4 months. In the first, infants received a micronutrient powder (MNP) containing 2.5 mg iron as NaFeEDTA or the MNP without iron. In the second, they received a different MNP containing 12.5 mg iron as ferrous fumarate or the MNP without the iron. The primary outcome was gut microbiome composition analysed by 16S pyrosequencing and targeted real-time PCR (qPCR). Secondary outcomes included faecal calprotectin (marker of intestinal inflammation) and incidence of diarrhoea. We analysed the trials separately and combined. RESULTS: At baseline, 63% of the total microbial 16S rRNA could be assigned to Bifidobacteriaceae but there were high prevalences of pathogens, including Salmonella Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and pathogenic Escherichia coli. Using pyrosequencing, +FeMNPs increased enterobacteria, particularly Escherichia/Shigella (p=0.048), the enterobacteria/bifidobacteria ratio (p=0.020), and Clostridium (p=0.030). Most of these effects were confirmed using qPCR; for example, +FeMNPs increased pathogenic E. coli strains (p=0.029). +FeMNPs also increased faecal calprotectin (p=0.002). During the trial, 27.3% of infants in +12.5 mgFeMNP required treatment for diarrhoea versus 8.3% in -12.5 mgFeMNP (p=0.092). There were no study-related serious adverse events in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In this setting, provision of iron-containing MNPs to weaning infants adversely affects the gut microbiome, increasing pathogen abundance and causing intestinal inflammation. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01111864.
TI  - Cyclophilin-facilitated membrane translocation as pharmacological target to prevent intoxication of mammalian cells by binary clostridial actin ADP-ribosylated toxins.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, Clostridium perfringens iota toxin and Clostridium difficile CDT belong to the family of binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins and are composed of a binding/translocation component and a separate enzyme component. The enzyme components ADP-ribosylate G-actin in the cytosol of target cells resulting in depolymerization of F-actin, cell rounding and cell death. The binding/translocation components bind to their cell receptors and form complexes with the respective enzyme components. After receptor-mediated endocytosis, the binding/translocation components form pores in membranes of acidified endosomes and the enzyme components translocate through these pores into the cytosol. This step is facilitated by the host cell chaperone heat shock protein 90 and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases including cyclophilin A. Here, we demonstrate that a large isoform of cyclophilin A, the multi-domain enzyme cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40), binds to the enzyme components C2I, Ia and CDTa in vitro. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a direct binding to C2I with a calculated affinity of 101 nM and to Ia with an affinity of 1.01 muM. Closer investigation for the prototypic C2I revealed that binding to Cyp40 did not depend on its ADP-ribosyltransferase activity but was stronger for unfolded C2I. The interaction of C2I with Cyp40 was also demonstrated in lysates from C2-treated cells by pull-down. Treatment of cells with a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine A derivative, which still binds to and inhibits the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins, protected cells from intoxication with C2, iota and CDT toxins, offering an attractive approach for development of novel therapeutic strategies against binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins.
TI  - Tailored cyclodextrin pore blocker protects mammalian cells from clostridium difficile binary toxin CDT.
AB  - Some Clostridium difficile strains produce, in addition to toxins A and B, the binary toxin Clostridium difficile transferase (CDT), which ADP-ribosylates actin and may contribute to the hypervirulence of these strains. The separate binding and translocation component CDTb mediates transport of the enzyme component CDTa into mammalian target cells. CDTb binds to its receptor on the cell surface, CDTa assembles and CDTb/CDTa complexes are internalised. In acidic endosomes, CDTb mediates the delivery of CDTa into the cytosol, most likely by forming a translocation pore in endosomal membranes. We demonstrate that a seven-fold symmetrical positively charged beta-cyclodextrin derivative, per-6-S-(3-aminomethyl)benzylthio-beta-cyclodextrin, which was developed earlier as a potent inhibitor of the translocation pores of related binary toxins of Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium perfringens, protects cells from intoxication with CDT. The pore blocker did not interfere with the CDTa-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of actin or toxin binding to Vero cells but inhibited the pH-dependent membrane translocation of CDTa into the cytosol. In conclusion, the cationic beta-cyclodextrin could serve as the lead compound in a development of novel pharmacological strategies against the CDT-producing strains of C. difficile.
TI  - Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens from wild carnivore species in  Brazil.
AB  - Despite some case reports, the importance of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile for wild carnivores remains unclear. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify C. perfringens and C. difficile strains in stool samples from wild carnivore species in Brazil. A total of 34 stool samples were collected and subjected to C. perfringens and C. difficile isolation. Suggestive colonies of C. perfringens were then analyzed for genes encoding the major C. perfringens toxins (alpha, beta, epsilon and iota) and the beta-2 toxin (cpb2), enterotoxin (cpe) and NetB (netb) genes. C. difficile strains were analyzed by multiplex-PCR for toxins A (tcdA) and B (tcdB) and a binary toxin gene (cdtB) and also submitted to a PCR ribotyping. Unthawed aliquots of samples positive for C. difficile isolation were subjected to the detection of A/B toxins by a cytotoxicity assay (CTA). C. perfringens was isolated from 26 samples (76.5%), all of which were genotyped as type A. The netb gene was not detected, whereas the cpb2 and cpe genes were found in nine and three C. perfringens strains, respectively. C. difficile was isolated from two (5.9%) samples. A non-toxigenic strain was recovered from a non-diarrheic maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus). Conversely, a toxigenic strain was found in the sample of a diarrheic ocelot (Leopardus pardallis); an unthawed stool sample was also positive for A/B toxins by CTA, indicating a diagnosis of C. difficile-associated diarrhea in this animal. The present work suggests that wild carnivore species could carry C. difficile strains and that they could be susceptible to C. difficile infection.
TI  - Clostridium difficile infection at a tertiary care hospital in south India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to detect C. difficile in patients presenting with Antibiotic Associated Diarrhoea. METHODS: Stool samples from twenty-five patients collected over a period of four months were processed for C. difficile by culture and the isolates were identified following standard methods. C. difficile toxins A and B and C. perfringens enterotoxin were detected by ELISA performed directly on stool specimens. RESULTS: Four patients (16%) were found positive for C. difficile infection. All patients with C. difficile infection received prior treatment with third-generation cephalosporins or beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor antibiotics. C. perfringens enterotoxin was found in two (8%) patients. Severe colitis was seen in one (25%) of the four patients who had co-infection with C. difficile and C. perfringens. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a significant occurrence of C. difficile infection in this hospital population. There is a need to further evaluate the role of C. perfringens in causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea. Good clinical and laboratory studies to generate local epidemiological data are essential to increase awareness among the treating clinicians about C. difficile infection. Also limited and rational use of broad spectrum antibiotics is recommended.
TI  - Gut microbiome in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) differs from that in healthy comparison babies and offers an explanation for the risk factor of prone position.
AB  - The role of bacteria in the causation of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is gaining acceptance. Mainstream research favouring respiratory compromise has failed to provide a plausible pathogenetic mechanism despite many years of investigation and thousands of research papers. Bacterial colonisation of the colon of the human infant is influenced by many factors including age, mode of delivery, diet, environment, and antibiotic exposure. The gut microbiome influences development of the immune system. The gut microflora could be important in protection against the bacteria and/or their toxins purportedly involved in SIDS pathogenesis. The aim was to perform a preliminary investigation of the gut microflora in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) compared with live comparison babies. The intestinal contents from 52 SIDS, and 102 faecal samples from age-matched live comparison infants were screened by PCR to target 16s RNA genes of Clostridium innocuum, Cl. Perfringens, Cl. difficile, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Staphylococcus aureus. Gut colonisation of the babies with these bacteria was analysed in relation to age, gender and type of feeding; and for SIDS babies sleeping position. Cl. difficile, Cl. innocuum and B. thetaiotaomicron were significantly associated with SIDS with 25%, 46% and 30% of cases PCR positive for these respective bacteria compared with only 6%, 23% and 8.8% respectively in the comparison group. SIDS babies had dual colonisation by both Cl. perfringens and Cl. difficile significantly more often than comparison babies and also with triple colonisation by Cl. perfringens, Cl. difficile and Cl. innocuum. SIDS babies were more often colonised by S. aureus than comparison babies. In addition, SIDS babies found prone were significantly more likely to be colonised by S. aureus than for other positions recorded (OR = infinity; CI = 2.04 - infinity). No significant differences between breast and bottle-fed SIDS babies was observed in regard to each clostridial bacterium, or S. aureus, however Cl. innocuum was found to be significantly associated with formula feeding in the comparison cohort. Comparison of breast and formula feeding of SIDS babies with live comparison babies revealed significant differences with regards to some of the clostridial bacteria. Age-specific differences in gut bacterial microbiome were observed in both SIDS and comparison healthy babies. This study gives an insight into differences in the gut bacterial microbiome of SIDS babies compared with healthy babies. These differences could be important in contributing to a baby's susceptibility to infection and therefore to SIDS. The association of S. aureus colonisation with prone sleep position supports the hypothesis that prone sleep position could increase the risk of ingestion/inhalation of bacteria contaminating the sleeping surface and could account for the increased risk of SIDS in babies who are put to sleep prone. The study provides impetus for broader studies into the gut microbiome of babies and could lead to effective approaches to SIDS prevention.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile in cooked beef sold in Cote d'Ivoire and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens in cooked beef sold in the streets in Cote d'Ivoire and their antimicrobial susceptibility. A total of 395 kidney and flesh samples of cooked beef were collected from vendors at Abidjan and subjected to C. difficile and C. perfringens isolation and identification by using biochemical tests, API 20A system and PCR detection. Subsequently, the antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for confirmed isolates. Our results showed the prevalence of 12.4% for C. difficile (11.04% in kidney and 13.45% in flesh) and 5.06% for C. perfringens (2.32% in kidney and 7.17% in flesh). Metronidazole and vancomycin remained the most potent antimicrobial agents against C. difficile while metronidazole and penicillin G were the most potent agents against C. perfringens. The resistance rates to tetracycline, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against C. difficile and C. perfringens isolates ranged from 2.05% to 8.16% and from 20% to 50%, respectively. Among all antimicrobial agents tested against C. difficile, percentages of resistance to quinolones ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid as well as to gentamicin and cefotaxime were the highest. Eight resistant phenotypes were defined for C. difficile isolates and eleven resistant phenotypes for C. perfringens isolates. Clindamycin/gentamicin/cefotaxime/ciprofloxacin/norfloxacin/nalidixic acid resistance was the most common phenotype for C. difficile (55.10% of isolates) while norfloxacin/nalidixic acid resistance was the most common phenotype for C. perfringens (20% of isolates).
TI  - Haemorrhagic toxin and lethal toxin from Clostridium sordellii strain vpi9048: molecular characterization and comparative analysis of substrate specificity of the large clostridial glucosylating toxins.
AB  - Large clostridial glucosylating toxins (LCGTs) are produced by toxigenic strains  of Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium novyi and Clostridium sordellii. While most C. sordellii strains solely produce lethal toxin (TcsL), C. sordellii strain VPI9048 co-produces both hemorrhagic toxin (TcsH) and TcsL. Here, the sequences of TcsH-9048 and TcsL-9048 are provided, showing that both toxins retain conserved LCGT features and that TcsL and TcsH are highly related to Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB) from C. difficile strain VPI10463. The substrate profile of the toxins was investigated with recombinant LCGT transferase domains (rN) and a wide panel of small GTPases. rN-TcsH-9048 and rN-TcdA-10463 glucosylated preferably Rho-GTPases but also Ras-GTPases to some extent. In this respect, rN-TcsH-9048 and rN-TcdA-10463 differ from the respective full-length TcsH-9048 and TcdA-10463, which exclusively glucosylate Rho-GTPases. rN-TcsL-9048 and full length TcsL-9048 glucosylate both Rho- and Ras-GTPases, whereas rN-TcdB-10463 and full length TcdB-10463 exclusively glucosylate Rho-GTPases. Vero cells treated with full length TcsH-9048 or TcdA-10463 also showed glucosylation of Ras, albeit to a lower extent than of Rho-GTPases. Thus, in vitro analysis of substrate spectra using recombinant transferase domains corresponding to the auto-proteolytically cleaved domains, predicts more precisely the in vivo substrates than the full length toxins. Except for TcdB-1470, all LCGTs evoked increased expression of the small GTPase RhoB, which exhibited cytoprotective activity in cells treated with TcsL isoforms, but pro-apoptotic activity in cells treated with TcdA, TcdB, and TcsH. All LCGTs induced a rapid dephosphorylation of pY118-paxillin and of pS144/141-PAK1/2 prior to actin filament depolymerization indicating that disassembly of focal adhesions is an early event leading to the disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.
TI  - Essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of Angelica archangelica L.  (Apiaceae) roots.
AB  - In this paper, the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Angelica archangelica L. (Apiaceae) roots from central Italy were analyzed. The major constituents of the oil were alpha-pinene (21.3%), delta-3-carene (16.5%), limonene (16.4%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.7%). The oil shows a good antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Eubacterium limosum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 0.25, 0.25, 0.13, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50% v/v, respectively. A weaker antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli-very useful in the intestinal microflora-has also been shown with MIC values >4.0% v/v.
TI  - The effect of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) on average daily gain and mortality in 4 Danish pig herds.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study evaluated the effect of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) on average daily gain (ADG) and mortality and described the clinical manifestations in four herds suffering from the syndrome. NNPDS is a diarrhoeic syndrome affecting piglets within the first week of life, which is not caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) type A/C, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), rotavirus A, coronavirus, Cystoisospora suis, Strongyloides ransomi, Giardia spp or Cryptosporidium spp. RESULTS: Piglets were estimated to have a negative ADG of 9 and 14 g when diarrhoeic for 1 day and >1 day respectively. However, if only diarrhoeic on the day of birth, no negative effect on ADG was seen. Piglets originating from severely affected litters were estimated to have a reduced ADG of 38 g. The study did not show an overall effect of diarrhoea on mortality, but herd of origin, sow parity, birth weight, and gender were significantly associated with mortality. In one of the herds, approximately 25% of the diarrhoeic piglets vs. 6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets died, and 74% of necropsied piglets were diagnosed with enteritis. These findings indicate that the high mortality seen in this herd was due to diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: NNPDS negatively affected ADG in piglets, and even piglets that were diarrhoeic for one day only experienced a reduction in ADG. However, the study showed that diarrhoea restricted to the day of birth did not affect ADG and suggested this phenomenon to be unrelated to the syndrome. Since the diarrhoeal status of the litter had important effects on ADG, future research on NNPDS probably ought to focus on piglets from severely affected litters.The study showed important dissimilarities in the course of diarrhoea between the herds, and one herd was considerably more affected than the others. Within this herd, NNPDS seemed to be associated with a higher mortality, whereas in general the study did not show lethal effects of NNPDS.
TI  - LRP1 is a receptor for Clostridium perfringens TpeL toxin indicating a two-receptor model of clostridial glycosylating toxins.
AB  - Large glycosylating toxins are major virulence factors of various species of pathogenic Clostridia. Prototypes are Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, which cause antibiotics-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. The current model of the toxins' action suggests that receptor binding is mediated by a C-terminal domain of combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROP). This model is challenged by the glycosylating Clostridium perfringens large cytotoxin (TpeL toxin) that is devoid of the CROP domain but still intoxicates cells. Using a haploid genetic screen, we identified LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a host cell receptor for the TpeL toxin. LRP1-deficient cells are not able to take up TpeL and are not intoxicated. Expression of cluster IV of LRP1 is sufficient to rescue toxin uptake in these cells. By plasmon resonance spectroscopy, a KD value of 23 nM was determined for binding of TpeL to LRP1 cluster IV. The C terminus of TpeL (residues 1335-1779) represents the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the toxin. RBD-like regions are conserved in all other clostridial glycosylating toxins preceding their CROP domain. CROP-deficient C. difficile toxin B is toxic to cells, depending on the RBD-like region (residues 1349-1811) but does not interact with LRP1. Our data indicate the presence of a second, CROP-independent receptor-binding domain in clostridial glycosylating toxins and suggest a two-receptor model for the cellular uptake of clostridial glycosylating toxins.
TI  - Utility of the clostridial site-specific recombinase TnpX to clone toxic-product-encoding genes and selectively remove genomic DNA fragments.
AB  - TnpX is a site-specific recombinase responsible for the excision and insertion of the transposons Tn4451 and Tn4453 in Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, respectively. Here, we exploit phenotypic features of TnpX to facilitate genetic mutagenesis and complementation studies. Genetic manipulation of bacteria often relies on the use of antibiotic resistance genes; however, a limited number are available for use in the clostridia. The ability of TnpX to recognize and excise specific DNA fragments was exploited here as the basis of an antibiotic resistance marker recycling system, specifically to remove antibiotic resistance genes from plasmids in Escherichia coli and from marked chromosomal C. perfringens mutants. This methodology enabled the construction of a C. perfringens plc virR double mutant by allowing the removal and subsequent reuse of the same resistance gene to construct a second mutation. Genetic complementation can be challenging when the gene of interest encodes a product toxic to E. coli. We show that TnpX represses expression from its own promoter, PattCI, which can be exploited to facilitate the cloning of recalcitrant genes in E. coli for subsequent expression in the heterologous host C. perfringens. Importantly, this technology expands the repertoire of tools available for the genetic manipulation of the clostridia.
TI  - Evaluation of a multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of bacterial and viral enteropathogens in stool samples of paediatric patients.
AB  - We evaluated a multiplex PCR assay, the Seeplex Diarrhoea ACE detection, that simultaneously detects 15 enteric pathogens, including Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., toxin B producer Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, adenovirus, Group A rotavirus, norovirus GI and GII, and astrovirus. We compared this assay with clinical methods routinely used in our laboratory, for detecting enteropathogens in stool samples collected from 245 paediatric patients with suspected infectious gastroenteritis. We recovered 61 bacterial pathogens and 121 enteric viruses with our laboratory assays, while we detected 78 bacteria and 167 viruses with the molecular assay. We calculated specificity and sensitivity for both methods after analysis of discordant results and demonstrated greater sensitivity for multiplex PCR than for our routine methods, with the exception of Salmonella spp. and toxigenic C. difficile detection. The multiplex PCR assay proved to be a reliable tool to directly detect the most common enteropathogens in stool samples but with some limitations.
TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridization investigation of potentially pathogenic bacteria involved in neonatal porcine diarrhea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal diarrhea is a multifactorial condition commonly present on pig farms and leads to economic losses due to increased morbidity and mortality of piglets. Immature immune system and lack of fully established microbiota at birth predispose neonatal piglets to infection with enteric pathogens. The microorganisms that for decades have been associated with enteritis and diarrhea in suckling piglets are: rotavirus A, coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens type C, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Cystoisospora suis and Strongyloides ransomi. However, in recent years, the pig industry has experienced an increased number of neonatal diarrhea cases in which the above mentioned pathogens are no longer detected. Potentially pathogenic bacteria have recently received focus in the research on the possible etiology of neonatal diarrhea not caused by common pathogens. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the role of E. coli, Enterococcus spp., C. perfringens and C. difficile in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea with no established casual agents. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes was applied on the fixed intestinal tissue samples from 51 diarrheic and 50 non-diarrheic piglets collected from four Danish farms during outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea not caused by well-known enteric pathogens. Furthermore, an association between the presence of these bacteria and histological lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of fluorescence signals specific for E. coli, C. perfringens and C. difficile was similar in both groups of piglets. However, Enterococcus spp. was primarily detected in the diarrheic piglets. Furthermore, adherent bacteria were detected in 37 % diarrheic and 14 % non-diarrheic piglets. These bacteria were identified as E. coli and Enterococcus spp. and their presence in the intestinal mucosa was associated with histopathological changes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that simultaneous colonization of the intestinal mucosa by adherent non-ETEC E. coli and Enterococcus spp. can be involved in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea. These bacteria should be considered in diagnosis of diarrhea in piglets, when detection of common, well-known enteric agents is unsuccessful.
TI  - Characterization of Clostridium perfringens in the feces of adult horses and foals with acute enterocolitis.
AB  - Up to 60% of cases of equine colitis have no known cause. To improve understanding of the causes of acute colitis in horses, we hypothesized that Clostridium perfringens producing enterotoxin (CPE) and/or beta2 toxin (CPB2) are common and important causes of severe colitis in horses and/or that C. perfringens producing an as-yet-undescribed cytotoxin may also cause colitis in horses. Fecal samples from 55 horses (43 adults, 12 foals) with clinical evidence of colitis were evaluated by culture for the presence of Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, and Salmonella. Feces were also examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for C. difficile A/B toxins and C. perfringens alpha toxin (CPA), beta2 toxin (CPB2), and enterotoxin (CPE). Five C. perfringens isolates per sample were genotyped for the following genes: cpa, cpb, cpb2 consensus, cpb2 atypical, cpe (enterotoxin), etx (epsilon toxin), itx (iota toxin), netB (necrotic enteritis toxin B), and tpeL (large C. perfringens cytotoxin). The supernatants of these isolates were also evaluated for toxicity for an equine cell line. All fecal samples were negative for Salmonella. Clostridium perfringens and C. difficile were isolated from 40% and 5.4% of samples, respectively. All fecal samples were negative for CPE. Clostridium perfringens CPA and CPB2 toxins were detected in 14.5% and 7.2% of fecal samples, respectively, all of which were culture-positive for C. perfringens. No isolates were cpe, etx, netB, or tpeL gene-positive. Atypical cpb2 and consensus cpb2 genes were identified in 15 (13.6%) and 4 (3.6%) of 110 isolates, respectively. All equine C. perfringens isolates showed far milder cytotoxicity effects than a CPB-producing positive control, although cpb2-positive isolates were slightly but significantly more cytotoxic than negative isolates. Based on this studied population, we were unable to confirm our hypothesis that CPE and CPB2-producing C. perfringens are common in horses with colitis in Ontario and we failed to identify cytotoxic activity in vitro in the type A isolates recovered.
TI  - Diarylacylhydrazones: Clostridium-selective antibacterials with activity against  stationary-phase cells.
AB  - Current antibiotics for treating Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), that is, metronidazole, vancomycin and more recently fidaxomicin, are mostly effective but treatment failure and disease relapse remain as significant clinical problems. The shortcomings of these agents are attributed to their low selectivity for C. difficile over normal gut microflora and their ineffectiveness against C. difficile spores. This Letter reports that certain diarylacylhydrazones identified during a high-throughput screening/counter-screening campaign show selective activity against two Clostridium species (C. difficile and Clostridium perfringens) over common gut commensals. Representative examples are shown to possess activity similar to vancomycin against clinical C. difficile strains and to kill stationary-phase C. difficile cells, which are responsible for spore production. Structure-activity relationships with additional synthesised analogues suggested a protonophoric mechanism may play a role in the observed activity/selectivity and this was supported by the well-known protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) showing selective anti-Clostridium effects and activity similar to diarylacylhydrazones against stationary-phase C. difficile cells. Two diarylacylhydrazones were shown to be non-toxic towards human FaDu and Hep G2 cells indicating that further studies with the class are warranted towards new drugs for CDI.
TI  - Detection of toxins A/B and isolation of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens from dogs in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
AB  - The objective of this study was to detect C. difficile A/B toxins and to isolate  strains of C. perfringens and C. difficile from diarrheic and non-diarrheic dogs in Brazil. Stool samples were collected from 57 dogs, 35 of which were apparently healthy, and 22 of which were diarrheic. C. difficile A/B toxins were detected by ELISA, and C. perfringens and C. difficile were identified by multiplex PCR. C. difficile A/B toxins were detected in 21 samples (36.8%). Of these, 16 (76.2%) were from diarrheic dogs, and five (23.8%) were from non-diarrheic dogs. Twelve C. difficile strains (21.1%) were isolated, of which ten were A(+)B(+) and two were A(-)B(-). All non-toxigenic strains were isolated from non-diarrheic animals. The binary toxin gene cdtB was found in one strain, which was A(+)B(+) and was derived from a non-diarrheic dog. C. perfringens strains were isolated from 40 samples (70.2%). Of these, 18 (45%) were from the diarrheic group, and 22 (55%) belonged to the non-diarrheic group. All isolates were classified as C. perfringens type A and there was an association between the detection of the cpe gene and the presence of diarrhea. Interestingly, ten strains (25%) were positive for the presence of the cpb2 gene. The high rate of detection of the A/B toxins in non-diarrheic dogs suggests the occurrence of subclinical disease in dogs or carriage of its toxins without disease. More studies are needed to elucidate the epidemiology of C. difficile and C. perfringens in dogs and to better our understanding of C. difficile as a zoonotic agent. This is the first study to report the binary toxin gene in C. difficile strains isolated from dogs in Brazil.
TI  - A retrospective study on the etiological diagnoses of diarrhea in neonatal piglets in Ontario, Canada, between 2001 and 2010.
AB  - Laboratory surveillance data from the Animal Health Laboratory, University of Guelph, on the etiological diagnoses of neonatal diarrhea in piglets were analyzed to determine the relative importance and trends of different enteric pathogens in Ontario. A total of 237 cases, including live and dead 1- to 7-day-old piglets, were submitted for diagnosis of gastrointestinal illness between 2001 and 2010. The combined frequencies for cases of gastrointestinal illness involving Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens type A, rotavirus, and Clostridium difficile, either as single pathogens or a complex of pathogens, accounted for 56% of the total cases. In a total of 33% of cases of gastrointestinal illness, an etiological agent was not identified. The frequency of cases diagnosed with enterotoxigenic E. coli was decreased from 2007. Cases submitted in 2010 were more likely to be diagnosed with C. perfringens type A compared to cases submitted in 2002 to 2007 (P < 0.05). There was a significant trend for cases submitted in the winter to be diagnosed with C. perfringens type A, enterotoxigenic E. coli, rotavirus, and Cystoisospora suis (formerly Isospora suis) (P < 0.05). Enterotoxigenic E. coli was less likely diagnosed if C. difficile, C. perfringens, or rotavirus were detected (P < 0.05). Younger piglets were more likely to be diagnosed with C. perfringens type A (P < 0.05) and C. difficile (P < 0.05) than older piglets. This study shows that E. coli, C. perfringens type A, rotavirus, and C. difficile are enteric pathogens of concern for Ontario swine farrowing operations and further research is required to understand the reasons for the cases that are not diagnosed.
TI  - Microbiological, pathological and histological findings in four Danish pig herds  affected by a new neonatal diarrhoea syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal diarrhoea is a frequent clinical condition in commercial swine herds, previously regarded to be uncomplicated to treat. However, since 2008 it seems that a new neonatal diarrhoeic syndrome unresponsive to antibiotics and common management practices has emerged. Routine laboratory examinations have not detected any pathogen related to this syndrome. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate if well-known enteric pathogens could be associated with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea, thus question the hypotheses of a new syndrome. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate macroscopic and microscopic findings associated with these outbreaks and if possible propose a preliminary piglet-level case-definition on syndrome New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea syndrome (NNPDS). RESULTS: Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea with no previously established laboratory conclusion and suspected to suffer from New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome, were selected. Within these herds, 51 diarrhoeic and 50 non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were necropsied and subjected to histological and microbiological examination. Faeces were non-haemorrhagic. Neither enterotoxigenic E. coli, Clostridium perfringens type A or C, Clostridium difficile, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia spp, Cystoisospora suis nor Strongyloides ransomi were associated with diarrhoea in the investigated outbreaks. Macroscopically, the diarrhoeic piglets were characterized by filled stomachs and flaccid intestines without mucosal changes. The predominant histological lesions were villous atrophy in jejunum and ileum. Epithelial lesions in colon were seen in one third of the case piglets. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study supported the hypothesis that a new neonatal porcine diarrhoea was present in the investigated herds, since no known pathogen(s) or management factors could explain the diarrhoeal outbreaks. Based on the findings in the four herds the following case-definition of NNPDS was suggested: Non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the first week of life, without detection of known infectious pathogens, characterized by milk-filled stomachs and flaccid intestines at necropsy.
TI  - Growth-Inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. METHOD: A microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the test materials against the organisms. RESULTS: delta-3-Carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium difficile ATCC 9689, Clostridium paraputrificum ATCC 25780, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 and Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 0.18-0.70 mg/mL) except for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 13311 (MIC, 2.94 mg/mL). The MIC of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/mL against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against C. difficile (0.70 mg/mL); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/mL) and 4 (5.80 mg/mL) against C. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/mL), 4 (12.0 mg/mL), and 7 (0.70 mg/mL) against C. perfringens); compound 1 against E. coli (7.20 mg/mL) and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (12.0 mg/mL). Overall, all of the constituents were less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (MIC, 0.063-0.25 mg/ mL). The lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium Clostridium butyricum ATCC 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (B. fragilis and E. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. Beneficial Gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful Gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria was not observed. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. CONCLUSION: A. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a refresher on causes and possible prevention with probiotics--continuing education article.
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) describes any unexplained diarrhea associated with the use of an antibiotic. AAD also includes infection caused by Clostridium difficile, however this organism only accounts for a small percentage of diarrhea caused by antibiotics. AAD can be caused by multiple other organisms including C perfringens, S aureus, and Candida. Some antibiotics are more likely to cause non-C difficile AAD, such as erythromycin and the penicillin class. AAD develops through the loss of normal flora and reduced colonic bacterial carbohydrate metabolism during antibiotic administration. There is an increasing interest in the use of probiotics for the prevention of AAD. There are several meta-analyses that report a relative risk reduction of AAD with the use of probiotics during antibiotic administration. Interpretation of these studies has been challenging due to the heterogeneity and size of the patient populations, unclear probiotic regimen, and unclear safety profile. Since AAD can be a reason for a patient to become non-compliant or receive incomplete treatment, clinicians should monitor for this potential adverse effect caused by antibiotics.
TI  - Enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens infection and pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clostridium difficile is the major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is the most well known bacterial pathogen associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens has also been detected in up to 15% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea cases, and it has not been found in healthy people. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of C. perfringens infection in pediatric patients with IBD. METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled study evaluating pediatric IBD patients in the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition in Warsaw, Poland. All of the patients were diagnosed according to the Porto criteria. There were two control groups: (1) non-IBD patients that were suspected for bacterial diarrhea and (2) healthy children. Stool samples were collected on the day of admission. C. perfringens infection diagnosis was based on a positive stool enzyme immunoassay (C. perfringens enterotoxin test kit TechLab). RESULTS: 91 fecal specimens from patients with IBD were collected. The average patient age was 11.7 years in IBD group, 7.4 years in non-IBD patients with diarrhea, and 7.4 years in healthy children. The prevalence of C. perfringens infection was 9% (8/91; CI 95% 4.6-16.4). There were more Crohn's patients (6/8) in the C. perfringens positive group. There was no C. perfringens infection in the two control groups. CONCLUSION: Our pilot data add evidence to the hypothesis that Clostridia other than C. difficile may play a significant role in the clinical course of IBD. However, further studies are needed to confirm this.
TI  - [Nosocomial diarrhea in intensive care unit: other than Clostridium difficile].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and clinical features of non-Clostridium  difficile (C. difficile) associated nosocomial diarrhea in intensive care unit (ICU) caused by Klebsiella oxytoca and Clostridium perfringens. METHODS: The faeces of 102 patients with non-C. difficile associated nosocomial diarrhea in ICU of West China Hospital, were collected during April to November, 2012. The target bacterial genes were detected by PCR amplification and sequencing, including toxic gene pehX of Klebsiella oxytoca, species-specific 16S rRNA gene and toxic gene cpa and cpe of Clostridium perfringens, species-specific 16S rRNA gene with mapA and toxic gene hipO of Campylobacter jejuni. Clinical features of the patients with positive results were summarized. RESULTS: Among 102 patients with non-C. difficile associated nosocomial diarrhea, 4 patients (3.9%) were detected with toxic Klebsiella oxytoca while 4 patients (3.9%) were detected with toxic Clostridium perfringens. No toxic Campylobacter jejuni was detected. Most of the patients had severe underlying diseases and poor final outcome, accepted potent antibiotics which disturbed intestinal flora obviously.. CONCLUSION: Non-C. difficile associated nosocomial diarrhea in ICU caused by Klebsiella oxytoca is and Clostridium perfringens is associated with severe diseases and poor outcome, but the incidence in our hospital is relatively low in our hospital.
TI  - [The hot point and controversy of clinical measures in critical are medicine].
AB  - With its powerful ability to monitoring and support of organs, the survival rate  of critically ill patients has been improved significantly by critical care medicine. Critical ill patients centralized in ICU accepted the treatments given by multidisciplinary team as a mode have played a very important role, especially during the rescue of victims in public health emergencies and natural disasters. Changings of the measures of monitoring and support are always along with the development of the critical care medicine. Fluid therapy is the most core measures in ICU, but there is a significant contradiction between positive fluid therapy and patient's impaired organ compensatory ability. The premise of appropriate fluid therapy is continuous and accurate evaluation of the hemodynamic status of critical ill patients. The variation of peak velocity of common carotid artery measured by bedside ultrasound can estimate the volume status of the SICU patients accurately. This method has high feasibility and accuracy and easy to be handled by the residents of ICU. The non-C. difficile associated nosocomial diarrhea even fatal enteritis in ICU can be caused by Klebsiella oxytoca and Clostridium perfringens. Although this kind of incidence occurs in a relatively low rate, it always associates with severe diseases and poor outcome. Analgesia and sedation had become routine measures in ICU. There is still great controversy in some of the sedation protocol, such as sedation level and wake up daily. More and more evidence-based data suggested taking appropriate sedation targeting to individuals, and the protocol should be integrated with the dealing of pain, anxiety and delirium.
TI  - Cyclodextrin derivatives as anti-infectives.
AB  - Cyclodextrin derivatives can be utilized as anti-infectives with pore-forming proteins as the targets. The highly efficient selection of potent inhibitors was achieved because per-substituted cyclodextrins have the same symmetry as the target pores. Inhibitors of several bacterial toxins produced by Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium difficile were identified from a library of approximately 200 CD derivatives. It was demonstrated that multi-targeted inhibitors can be found using this approach and could be utilized for the development of broad-spectrum drugs against various pathogens.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - An investigation into the association between cpb2-encoding Clostridium perfringens type A and diarrhea in neonatal piglets.
AB  - To investigate the possible role of cpb2-positive type A Clostridium perfringens  in neonatal diarrheal illness in pigs, the jejunum and colon of matched normal and diarrheic piglets from 10 farms with a history of neonatal diarrhea were examined grossly and by histopathology, and tested for C. perfringens, for C. perfringens beta2 (CPB2) toxin, as well as for Clostridium difficile toxins, Salmonella, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, and coccidia. Clostridium perfringens isolates were tested using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the presence of cpa, consensus and atypical cpb2, and other virulence-associated genes. The numbers of C. perfringens in the intestinal contents were lower in diarrheic piglets (log(1)(0) 5.4 CFU/g) compared with normal piglets (log(1)(0) 6.5 CFU/g) (P < 0.05). The consensus cpb2 was present in 93% of isolates in each group, but atypical cpb2 was less common (56% healthy, 32% diarrheic piglets isolates, respectively, P < 0.05). The presence of CPB2 toxin in the intestinal contents of normal and diarrheic piglets did not differ significantly. Clostridium difficile toxins and rotavirus were each detected in 7 of the 21 (33%) diarrheic piglets. Rotavirus, C. difficile toxins, Salmonella, or enterotoxigenic E. coli were concurrently recovered in different combinations in 4 diarrheic piglets. The cause of diarrhea in 8 of the 21 (38%) piglets on 6 farms remained unknown. The etiological diagnosis of diarrhea could not be determined in any of the piglets on 2 of the farms. This study demonstrated that the number of cpb2-positive type A C. perfringens in the intestinal contents was not a useful approach for making a diagnosis of type A C. perfringens enteritis in piglets. Further work is required to confirm whether cpb2-carrying type A C. perfringens have a pathogenic role in enteric infection in neonatal swine.
TI  - Infectious agents associated with diarrhoea in neonatal foals in central Kentucky: a comprehensive molecular study.
AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Diarrhoea caused by infectious agents is common in  foals but there is no comprehensive molecular work-up of the relative prevalence of common agents and appearance of coinfections. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of 9 infectious agents in gastrointestinal (GI)-diseased and healthy foals with ages ranging from 1 to 20 weeks of age and to what degree coinfections are associated with clinical signs of GI disease. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective controlled observational study. METHODS: The population consisted of 88 Thoroughbred foals aged 2 days to 17 weeks born on 32 different studfarms in Kentucky. Healthy (n = 37) and GI-diseased (n = 51) foals were identified based on clinical presentation. Faecal samples were analysed for 9 infectious agents by real-time PCR: equine rotavirus, equine coronavirus, Clostridium difficile toxins A & B, Neorickettsia risticii, Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin, Lawsonia intracellularis, Rhodococcus equi, Cryptosporidium spp., and Salmonella spp. Salmonella was also cultured from overnight selenite enrichment broth. RESULTS: The prevalence of infectious pathogens under study was between 0% (Lawsonia intracellularis) and 34.6% (equine rotavirus). The overall prevalence for any infectious agent was 63.2% in the GI-diseased group and 43.2% in the healthy group. Coinfections were significantly more frequent in the sick group (15 monoinfections vs. 22 coinfections) than in the healthy group (12 vs. 4, respectively, P = 0.0002). Six of the 8 infectious agents were associated with the GI-diseased group, the other 2 were not (equine coronavirus and R. equi). CONCLUSIONS: The use of panels rather than individual tests in combination with quantitative toxin gene analysis enables detection of coinfections significantly associated with risk of disease. Several infectious diseases previously not tested for or considered unimportant were found at high prevalence and require further investigation.
TI  - In vitro selective inhibitory effect of 8-hydroxyquinoline against bifidobacteria and clostridia.
AB  - 8-Hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) inhibited Clostridium tertium, Clostridium clostridioforme, Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens in vitro with MICs of 8, 16, 32 and 32 mug/mL, respectively. In contrast, MICs of most bifidobacteria (84%) were 512 mug/mL or higher. Thus, 8HQ could be used as anti-clostridial agent or in selective media for bifidobacteria isolation.
TI  - Diarrhea-associated pathogens, lactobacilli and cellulolytic bacteria in equine feces: responses to antibiotic challenge.
AB  - Antibiotics are important to equine medicine, but antibiotic-associated diarrhea  (AAD) can lead to poor performance and even mortality. AAD is attributed to disruption of the hindgut microbiota, which permits proliferation of pathogenic microbes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of common antibiotics on cellulolytic bacteria, lactobacilli, and AAD-associated pathogens in the feces of healthy horses. Fifteen horses were assigned to three treatment groups (blocked by age and sex): control (no antibiotics), trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (PO), or ceftiofur (IM). Fecal samples (n=8 per horse) were taken during dietary adaptation (3 weeks), antibiotic challenge (1 week), and withdrawal (1 week). Bacteria were enumerated by serial dilution and viable count. Cellulolytic bacteria decreased by >99% during administration of either antibiotic (P<0.0001) and were still less than controls at the end of the withdrawal period (P<0.0001). Fecal samples from horses challenged with ceftiofur had 75% fewer lactobacilli than those from control horses at the end of the antibiotic challenge period (P<0.05). Antibiotic challenged horses also shed more salmonella than control horses (P<0.05). Antibiotics had no effect on the number of Clostridium perfringens isolates. There was no detectable Clostridium difficile during adaptation or in any control horse. C. difficile increased (P<0.0001) to approximately 10(4)cfu/g when horses were challenged with antibiotics, and were still detectable 1 week after withdrawal. These results indicate that antibiotics can disrupt the normal gastrointestinal microbiota and allow proliferation of Salmonella spp. and C. difficile.
TI  - Essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts and ripe fruits of Echinophora spinosa (Apiaceae) from Italy.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from the flowering aerial parts and ripe fruits of Echinophora spinosa L. (Apiaceae) from central Italy were analyzed by GC/MS. The major constituents of the oil from the aerial parts were beta-phellandrene (34.7%), myristicin (16.5%), delta3-carene (12.6%), alpha-pinene (6.7%) and alpha-phellandrene (6.2%), and of the oil from the ripe fruits p-cymene (50.2%), myristicin (15.3%), alpha-pinene (15.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.1%). The two oils showed good antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Eubacterium limosum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Candida albicans with MIC values respectively of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50%, v/v, and 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 2.25, 0.50%, v/v, for aerial parts and ripe fruits respectively. A less significant antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, very important in the intestinal microflora, was also detected, with MIC values higher than 4.0%, v/v.
TI  - Genetic characteristics of toxigenic Clostridia and toxin gene evolution.
AB  - Clostridia comprise a heterogenous group of environmental bacteria containing 15  pathogenic species, which produce the most potent toxins. The origin of toxins is still enigmatic. It is hypothesized that toxins exhibiting an enzymatic activity have derived from hydrolytic enzymes, which are abundantly secreted by these bacteria, and that pore-forming toxins have evolved from an ancestor transmembrane protein. The presence of related toxin genes in distinct Clostridium species and the variability of some toxin genes support horizontal toxin gene transfer and subsequent independent evolution from strain to strain. Clostridium perfringens toxin genes involved in myonecrosis, mainly alpha toxin and perfringolysin genes, are chromosomally located, whereas toxin genes responsible for intestinal and food borne diseases are localized on plasmids except the enterotoxin gene which can be located either on the chromosome or plasmids. The distribution of these plasmids containing one or several toxin genes accounts for the diverse C. perfringens toxinotypes. Clostridium difficile strains show a high genetic variability. But in contrast to C. perfringens, toxin genes are clustered in pathogenicity locus located on chromosome. The presence of related toxin genes in distinct clostridial species like Clostridium sordellii, Clostridium novyi, and C. perfringens supports interspecies mobilization of this locus. The multiple C. difficile toxinotypes based on toxin gene variants possibly reflect strain adaptation to the intestinal environment. Botulinum toxin genes also show a high level of genetic variation. They have a diverse genetic localization including chromosome, plasmid or phage, and are spread in various Clostridium species (Clostridium botulinum groups, Clostridium argentinense, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium baratii). Exchange of toxin genes not only include transfers between Clostridium species but also between Clostridium and other bacterial species as well as eukaryotic cells as supported by the wide distribution of related pore-forming toxins of the aerolysin family in various clostridial and non-clostridial species, animal, mushroom and plant.
TI  - Clostridium difficile infection in horses: a review.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is considered one of the most important causes of diarrhea  and enterocolitis in horses. Foals and adult horses are equally susceptible to the infection. The highly resistant spore of C. difficile is the infectious unit of transmission, which occurs primarily via the fecal-oral route, with sources of infection including equine feces, contaminated soil, animal hospitals, and feces of other animals. Two major risk factors for the development of C. difficile associated disease (CDAD) in adult horses are hospitalization and antimicrobial treatment, although sporadically, cases of CDAD can occur in horses that have not received antimicrobials or been hospitalized. The most common antibiotics associated with CDAD in horses are erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulfonamides, beta-lactam antimicrobials, clindamycin, rifampicin, and gentamicin. Clinical signs and intestinal lesions of CDAD infection are not specific and they cannot be used to distinguish infections by C. difficile from infections by other agents, such as Clostridium perfringens or Salmonella sp. The distribution of lesions throughout the intestinal tract seems to be age-dependent. Small intestine is invariably affected, and colon and cecum may or may not have lesions in foals<1-month old. Naturally acquired disease in older foals and adult horses has a more aboral distribution, affecting colon and sometimes cecum, but rarely the small intestine. Detection of toxin A, toxin B or both in intestinal contents or feces is considered the most reliable diagnostic criterion for CDAD in horses. Isolation of toxigenic strains of C. difficile from horses with intestinal disease is highly suggestive of CDAD. A better understanding of pathogenesis, reservoirs of infection, and vaccines and other methods of control is needed. Also further studies are recommended to investigate other possible predisposing factors and/or etiological agents of enteric diseases of horses.
TI  - Diagnosing clostridial enteric disease in poultry.
AB  - The world's poultry industry has grown into a multibillion-dollar business, the success of which hinges on healthy intestinal tracts, which result in effective feed conversion. Enteric disease in poultry can have devastating economic effects on producers, due to high mortality rates and poor feed efficiency. Clostridia are considered to be among the most important agents of enteric disease in poultry. Diagnosis of enteric diseases produced by clostridia is usually challenging, mainly because many clostridial species can be normal inhabitants of the gut, making it difficult to determine their role in virulence. The most common clostridial enteric disease in poultry is necrotic enteritis, caused by Clostridium perfringens, which typically occurs in broiler chickens but has also been diagnosed in various avian species including turkeys, waterfowl, and ostriches. Diagnosis is based on clinical and pathological findings. Negative culture and toxin detection results may be used to rule out this disease, but isolation of C. perfringens and/or detection of its alpha toxin are of little value to confirm the disease because both are often found in the intestine of healthy birds. Ulcerative enteritis, caused by Clostridium colinum, is the other major clostridial enteric disease of poultry. Diagnosis of ulcerative enteritis is by documentation of typical pathological findings, coupled with isolation of C. colinum from the intestine of affected birds. Other clostridial enteric diseases include infections produced by Clostridium difficile, Clostridium fallax, and Clostridium baratii.
TI  - In vitro inhibition of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens by commercial probiotic strains.
AB  - Probiotics have gained importance in human and veterinary medicine to prevent and control clostridial enteric disease. Limited information is available on the ability of different probiotic bacteria used in food products to inhibit Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens. The objective of this study was to examine the in vitro inhibitory effects of selected commercial bacterial strains on pathogenic clostridia and their growth characteristics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. The inhibitory effects of 17 commercial strains of Lactobacillus (n = 16) and Bifidobacterium (n = 1) on the reference strains of C. difficile and C. perfringens were assessed by an agar well diffusion assay and by a broth culture inhibition assay using cell-free supernatant harvested at different growth phases, with and without pH neutralization. To study growth characteristics, probiotic strains were cultivated in different acid and bile environments, and growth in the modified media was compared to growth in standard medium. In the agar well diffusion assay, supernatant obtained from two probiotic strains inhibited the growth of both reference and clinical strains of C. perfringens. This effect as seen when supernatant was assessed with and without pH neutralization. Supernatants obtained from 10 probiotic strains inhibited C. difficile only when supernatant was added without pH neutralization. In the broth culture inhibition assay, growth of C. perfringens and C. difficile was inhibited by supernatant without pH neutralization from 5 and 10 probiotic strains, respectively. All potential probiotic strains were able to grow at pH 4.0 and in the presence of 0.15% and 0.3% bile but none were able to grow or survive at pH 2.0. Altogether five probiotic strains [Lactobacillus plantarum (n = 2), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (n = 2), Bifidobacterium animalis lactis (n = 1)] were shown to inhibit all strains of C. difficile and C. perfringens. The inhibitory effect was probiotic strain-specific. Two strains showed a pH-independent inhibitory effect likely due to production of either antibiotics or bacteriocins inhibiting C. perfringens only. These strains have favourable growth characteristics for use as probiotics and their efficacy as prophylactic or therapeutic measures against clostridial enteric disease should be further evaluated by clinical trials in animals.
TI  - Detection of A/B toxin and isolation of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens from foals.
AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY: Toxin detection and screening could contribute  to knowledge of the transmission patterns, risk factors and epidemiology of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens. OBJECTIVE: To isolate C. difficile and C. perfringens and to detect A/B toxins in faecal samples from diarrhoeic and nondiarrhoeic foals. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. METHODS: A total of 153 samples from foals were collected: 139 samples from farms and 14 samples from diarrhoeic foals admitted to a veterinary hospital. The A/B toxins were detected by cytotoxicity assay. All suspected colonies of C. perfringens were subjected to polymerase chain reaction for detection of the major toxin genes (alpha, beta, epsilon and iota) and for detection of beta2-, NetB- and enterotoxin-encoding genes. Furthermore, C. difficile and C. perfringens isolates were evaluated for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Seven of 153 (4.6%) samples, all from diarrhoeic foals, were positive for C. difficile A/B toxin. Of these, 5 of 14 (35.7%) were from hospitalised foals, and only 2 of 63 (3.2%) diarrhoeic foal samples were from farms (P = 0.002). Clostridium perfringens was isolated from 31 (20.3%) foals, of which 21 of 76 (27.6%) were diarrhoeic and 10 of 76 (13.2%) were nondiarrhoeic, demonstrating a difference between these 2 groups (P = 0.045). Only 4 strains were positive for the beta2-encoding gene (cpb2). All C. difficile and C. perfringens isolates were susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: The present report highlights the need for laboratory diagnostics to differentiate C. difficile-associated infection in foals from other causes of diarrhoea to facilitate adequate antimicrobial therapy. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: More studies are needed to clarify the role of C. perfringens as a primary agent of diarrhoea in foals.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of the CspB protease required for Clostridium  spore germination.
AB  - Spores are the major transmissive form of the nosocomial pathogen Clostridium difficile, a leading cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea worldwide. Successful transmission of C. difficile requires that its hardy, resistant spores germinate into vegetative cells in the gastrointestinal tract. A critical step during this process is the degradation of the spore cortex, a thick layer of peptidoglycan surrounding the spore core. In Clostridium sp., cortex degradation depends on the proteolytic activation of the cortex hydrolase, SleC. Previous studies have implicated Csps as being necessary for SleC cleavage during germination; however, their mechanism of action has remained poorly characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that CspB is a subtilisin-like serine protease whose activity is essential for efficient SleC cleavage and C. difficile spore germination. By solving the first crystal structure of a Csp family member, CspB, to 1.6 A, we identify key structural domains within CspB. In contrast with all previously solved structures of prokaryotic subtilases, the CspB prodomain remains tightly bound to the wildtype subtilase domain and sterically occludes a catalytically competent active site. The structure, combined with biochemical and genetic analyses, reveals that Csp proteases contain a unique jellyroll domain insertion critical for stabilizing the protease in vitro and in C. difficile. Collectively, our study provides the first molecular insight into CspB activity and function. These studies may inform the development of inhibitors that can prevent clostridial spore germination and thus disease transmission.
TI  - Coinfection in acute gastroenteritis predicts a more severe clinical course in children.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of enteric pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis (AGE) among hospitalized children in a large Italian hospital, to measure the incidence of coinfections, and to compare the clinical characteristics of those infected with one versus multiple agents. A prospective study was conducted from March 2010 to April 2011 at the Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital in Rome, Italy. All patients between 1 month and 16 years of age admitted to the Pediatric Department with a diagnosis of AGE were eligible for enrollment. Two stool samples for each patient were tested for gastrointestinal pathogens. We summarized the clinical severity of episodes, describing the duration of diarrhea, duration and frequency of vomiting, fever, and severity of dehydration. All the patients underwent medical evaluation with estimation of dehydration. One or more etiological agents were detected in 151 out of 232 patients (65.1%), while we did not detect any etiological agent in 81 (34.9%). Rotavirus was detected in 96 (63.6%), adenovirus in 17 (11.2%), norovirus in 7 (4.6%), toxin-producing Clostridium difficile in 23 (15.2%), Salmonella spp. in 15 (9.9%, B group in 12/15 and D group in 3/15), C. perfringens in 12 (7.9%), Campylobacter spp. in 6 (4%), and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) in 2 (1.3%). In 27 children out of 151 (17.9%), we found evidence of coinfection. Coinfection with rotavirus and toxin-producing C. difficile was the most common (63%). Children with coinfection had a more severe clinical presentation and had a higher probability to be severely dehydrated, independently of age and living community type.
TI  - A probiotics-containing biscuit modulates the intestinal microbiota in the elderly.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of the impact of a biscuit containing the probiotics Bifidobacterium longum Bar33 and Lactobacillus helveticus Bar13 on the intestinal microbiota in the elderly. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two elderly volunteers living in Italy. The group was composed of 19 women and 13 men aged between 71 and 88 years (mean 76). INTERVENTION: Subjects were randomized in two groups consuming one dose of the probiotics-containing biscuit or placebo once a day for 30 days. MEASUREMENTS: For each subject the intestinal microbiota was characterized using the phylogenetic microarray platform HTF-Microbi.Array before and after intervention. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that one-month consumption of a probiotics-containing biscuit was effective in redressing some of the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota. In particular, the probiotic treatment reverted the age-related increase of the opportunistic pathogens Clostridium cluster XI, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecium and the enteropathogenic genus Campylobacter. CONCLUSION: The present study opens the way to the development of elderly-tailored probiotic-based functional foods to counteract the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota.
TI  - CD44 Promotes intoxication by the clostridial iota-family toxins.
AB  - Various pathogenic clostridia produce binary protein toxins associated with enteric diseases of humans and animals. Separate binding/translocation (B) components bind to a protein receptor on the cell surface, assemble with enzymatic (A) component(s), and mediate endocytosis of the toxin complex. Ultimately there is translocation of A component(s) from acidified endosomes into the cytosol, leading to destruction of the actin cytoskeleton. Our results revealed that CD44, a multifunctional surface protein of mammalian cells, facilitates intoxication by the iota family of clostridial binary toxins. Specific antibody against CD44 inhibited cytotoxicity of the prototypical Clostridium perfringens iota toxin. Versus CD44(+) melanoma cells, those lacking CD44 bound less toxin and were dose-dependently resistant to C. perfringens iota, as well as Clostridium difficile and Clostridium spiroforme iota-like, toxins. Purified CD44 specifically interacted in vitro with iota and iota-like, but not related Clostridium botulinum C2, toxins. Furthermore, CD44 knockout mice were resistant to iota toxin lethality. Collective data reveal an important role for CD44 during intoxication by a family of clostridial binary toxins.
TI  - Nosocomial infections in leukemic and solid-tumor cancer patients: distribution,  outcome and microbial spectrum of anaerobes.
AB  - AIMS: Nosocomial infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. As a result of their debilitated immune system, cancer patients are likely candidates for colonization with anaerobes. We sought to compare the distribution of nosocomial infections in neutropenic and non-neutropenic cancer patients and to calculate the associated mortality rates. MATERIAL & METHODS: This is the first study to demonstrate a complete microbial spectrum of anaerobes in various infection sites in hospitalized cancer patients. RESULTS: Frequencies of bloodstream infections (BSI), respiratory tract infections (RTI), and GI tract infections (GITI) were significantly higher in neutropenic cancer patients (p < 0.01). Conversely, urinary tract infection (UTI) and skin infection (SI) rates were significantly higher in non-neutropenic cancer patients (p < 0.01). Mortalities attributed to BSI, UTI, RTI, SI, and GITI occured at the respective percentage frequencies of 12.5%, 11.5%, 10.4%, 7.7% and 4.9%. Anaerobes constituted 4.7% of total isolates, and were recovered from SI (66.3%) and GITI (33.6%), but not respiratory tract, urine, or blood. Most anaerobes (79.2%) were isolated from solid-tumor patients. The most common infection in cancer patients was RTI (55.8%), mainly in leukemic patients, followed by SI (18%), only in solid-tumor patients, GITI (9.7%), BSI (9.4%), and UTI (7.1%). The most frequent isolates of Fusobacterium necrophorum (32.7%) and Eubacterium lentum (23.8%) were mostly recovered from solid-tumor patients. These were followed by Clostridium perfringens (11.9%), Clostridium difficile (10.9%), Eubacterium limosum (5.9%), and Veillonella parvula (5%). CONCLUSION: Control measures are needed to minimize risks of nosocomial infection outbreaks by anaerobes. Continuous monitoring of the presence of anaerobes in various infection sites in hospitalized cancer patients is needed in order to be able to provide the best supportive care for cancer patients.
TI  - Sensitivity of pathogenic and commensal bacteria from the human colon to essential oils.
AB  - The microbiota of the intestinal tract plays an important role in colonic health, mediating many effects of dietary components on colonic health and during enteric infections. In the context of the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance in gut bacteria, complementary therapies are required for the prevention and treatment of enteric infections. Here we report the potential application of essential oils (EO) and pure EO compounds to improve human gut health. Nerolidol, thymol, eugenol and geraniol inhibited growth of the pathogens Escherichia coli O157 : H7(VT(-)), Clostridium difficile DSM1296, Clostridium perfringens DSM11780, Salmonella typhimurium 3530 and Salmonella enteritidis S1400 at a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) varying from 50 to 500 p.p.m. Most EO showed greater toxicity to pathogens than to commensals. However, the beneficial commensal Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was sensitive to EO at similar or even lower concentrations than the pathogens. The EO showed dose-dependent effects on cell integrity, as measured using propidium iodide, of Gram-positive bacteria. These effects were not strongly correlated with growth inhibition, however, suggesting that cell membrane damage occurred but was not the primary cause of growth inhibition. Growth inhibition of Gram-negative bacteria, in contrast, occurred mostly without cell integrity loss. Principal component analysis showed clustering of responses according to bacterial species rather than to the identity of the EO, with the exception that responses to thymol and nerolidol clustered away from the other EO. In conclusion, the selective effects of some EO might have beneficial effects on gut health if chosen carefully for effectiveness against different species.
TI  - Presence and molecular characterization of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium  perfringens in intestinal compartments of healthy horses.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens are commonly associated with colitis in equids, but healthy carriers exist. Scarce information is available on the prevalence of Clostridium spp. in gastrointestinal compartments other than faeces in healthy horses, and it is unknown whether faecal samples are representative of proximal compartments. The objectives were to investigate the prevalence of C. difficile and C. perfringens in different intestinal compartments of healthy adult horses and to determine whether faecal samples are representative of colonization in proximal sites and overall carrier status. RESULTS: Toxigenic C. difficile was isolated from 14/135 (10.3%) samples from 8/15 (53.3%) horses. Between zero and three sites were positive per horse, and multiple sites were positive in four horses. Isolates were recovered from duodenum, jejunum, ileum, right dorsal colon, small colon and rectum. When multiple compartments were positive in a single horse, two different C. difficile ribotypes were always present. Clostridium perfringens Type A (CPE, beta2 toxin gene negative) was recovered from the left ventral colon of one horse (0.74%, 1/135 samples). Agreement between faeces and overall C. difficile carrier status was good. CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium difficile can be found in different compartments of the gastrointestinal tract of healthy horses, and multiple strains can be present in an individual horse. The prevalence of C. perfringens in healthy adult hoses was low, consistent with previous reports. Faecal samples were representative for presence of C. difficile in proximal compartments in 5/8 horses (63%) but were not representative for the specific strain.
TI  - Prophage carriage and diversity within clinically relevant strains of Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Prophages are encoded in most genomes of sequenced Clostridium difficile strains. They are key components of the mobile genetic elements and, as such, are likely to influence the biology of their host strains. The majority of these phages are not amenable to propagation, and therefore the development of a molecular marker is a useful tool with which to establish the extent and diversity of C. difficile prophage carriage within clinical strains. To design markers, several candidate genes were analyzed including structural and holin genes. The holin gene is the only gene present in all sequenced phage genomes, conserved at both terminals, with a variable mid-section. This allowed us to design two sets of degenerate PCR primers specific to C. difficile myoviruses and siphoviruses. Subsequent PCR analysis of 16 clinical C. difficile ribotypes showed that 15 of them are myovirus positive, and 2 of them are also siphovirus positive. Antibiotic induction and transmission electron microscope analysis confirmed the molecular prediction of myoviruses and/or siphovirus presence. Phylogenetic analysis of the holin sequences identified three groups of C. difficile phages, two within the myoviruses and a divergent siphovirus group. The marker also produced tight groups within temperate phages that infect other taxa, including Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, and Bacillus spp., which suggests the potential application of the holin gene to study prophage carriage in other bacteria. This study reveals the high incidence of prophage carriage in clinically relevant strains of C. difficile and correlates the molecular data to the morphological observation.
TI  - Nosocomial diarrhea: evaluation and treatment of causes other than Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Diarrhea is common among hospitalized patients but the causes are distinct from those of diarrhea in the community. We review existing data about the epidemiology of nosocomial diarrhea and summarize recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of diarrhea. Clinicians should recognize that most cases of nosocomial diarrhea have a noninfectious etiology, including medications, underlying illness, and enteral feeding. Apart from Clostridium difficile, the frequency of infectious causes such as norovirus and toxigenic strains of Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis remains largely undefined and test availability is limited. Here we provide a practical approach to the evaluation and management of nosocomial diarrhea when tests for C. difficile are negative.
TI  - Requirement of upstream Hfq-binding (ARN)x elements in glmS and the Hfq C-terminal region for GlmS upregulation by sRNAs GlmZ and GlmY.
AB  - Hfq is an important RNA-binding protein that helps bacteria adapt to stress. Its  primary function is to promote pairing between trans-acting small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) and their target mRNAs. Identification of essential Hfq-binding motifs in up-stream regions of rpoS and fhlA led us to ask the question whether these elements are a common occurrence among other Hfq-dependent mRNAs as well. Here, we confirm the presence of a similar (ARN)(x) motif in glmS RNA, a gene controlled by two sRNAs (GlmZ and GlmY) in an Hfq-dependent manner. GlmZ represents a canonical sRNA:mRNA pairing system, whereas GlmY is non-canonical, interfacing with the RNA processing protein YhbJ. We show that glmS interacts with both Hfq-binding surfaces in the absence of sRNAs. Even though two (ARN)(x) motifs are present, using a glmS:gfp fusion system, we determined that only one specific (ARN)(x) element is essential for regulation. Furthermore, we show that residues 66-72 in the C-terminal extension of Escherichia coli Hfq are essential for activation of GlmS expression by GlmY, but not with GlmZ. This result shows that the C-terminal extension of Hfq may be required for some forms of non-canonical sRNA regulation involving ancillary components such as additional RNAs or proteins.
TI  - Adherence of Clostridium difficile spores to Caco-2 cells in culture.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is the causative agent of the majority of antibiotic associated diarrhoea cases. C. difficile spores are recognized as the persistent and infectious morphotype as well as the vehicle of transmission of CDI. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how C. difficile spores interact with the host's epithelial surfaces. In this context, we have characterized the ability of C. difficile spores to adhere to human Caco-2 cells. Despite the similarities in spore-surface hydrophobicity between spores of C. difficile and Clostridium perfringens (another enteric pathogen that also sporulates in the gut), spores of C. difficile adhere better to Caco-2 cells. Adherence to Caco-2 cells was significantly reduced when C. difficile spores were treated with trypsin. Sonication of C. difficile spores altered the ultrastructure of the outermost exosporium-like structure, releasing two protein species of ~40 kDa and significantly reduced spore hydrophobicity and adherence to Caco-2 cells. Using a trifunctional cross-linker, we were able to co-immunoprecipitate four protein species from the surface of Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that C. difficile spores adhere to human intestinal enterocyte-like cells through spore- and enterocytic-surface-specific ligand(s) and/or receptor(s).
TI  - Treatment with histamine-type 2 receptor antagonists and omeprazole increase the  risk of diarrhoea in neonatal foals treated in intensive care units.
AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: The use of anti-ulcer medication in the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) is common due to the concern for development of catastrophic gastric ulcerdisease. In man, however, the use of acid-suppressive medication has been shown in some studies to be a substantial riskfactorfor the development of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), bacteraemia and neonatal sepsis. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study reported herein is to evaluate the influence of anti-ulcer medications on the development of diarrhoea in the neonatalfoal. HYPOTHESIS: The use of anti-ulcer medication does not alter the incidence of diarrhoea in foals treated in an ICU. METHODS: The records of 1710 foals from 6 different equine hospitals were examined and the use of anti-ulcer drugs was recorded. The presence of in-hospital acquired diarrhoea, CDAD, Clostridium perfringens-associated diarrhoea, neonatal sepsis and salmonellosis were documented. In addition, the presence of gastric ulceration, duration of hospital stay and short-term outcome were examined. RESULTS: The use of anti-ulcer medications increased the odds of in-hospital diarrhoea by 2.0 (95% CI 1.4-2.9; P < 0.0001), relative to the use of no anti-ulcer medication. There was no significant association of anti-ulcer medication with CDAD (P = 0.3189) (OR 2.0; 95% CI 0.4-9.5). Further, results indicated that decreased prevalence of gastric ulceration was not associated with use of anti-ulcer drugs among foals in the study for which these data were known (P = 0.5522). CONCLUSIONS: Use of anti-ulcer drugs increases the odds of developing diarrhoea, and may not reduce the incidence of gastric ulceration in hospitalised equine neonates. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: The use of anti-ulcer drugs in neonatal foals being treated in a hospital setting should be carefully evaluated on an individual basis to determine if such use is warranted.
TI  - Oxygen tolerance in anaerobic pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A prerequisite for successful identification of anaerobic pathogenic bacteria from samples of clinical material is the method of cultivation. Currently, several methods of cultivation in anaerobic environment are used: cultivation in anaerobic box, anaerobic jar, and in nonrecurring cultivation system. Here, we determined the suitability of the above methods of cultivation using the estimation of the growth (diameters of colony size) of commonly isolated anaerobic pathogens (Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium perfringens). The tested bacterial strains were exposed to atmospheric oxygen for various time periods and then they were cultivated using different anaerobic cultivation systems. Maximum growth differed, depending on the type of cultivation and the strain used. Thus, largest zone diameters, in the majority of measurements, were achieved in the anaerobic box. However, nonrecurring cultivation system seemed better in several cases; this applied to the cultivation of C. perfringens after 15, 30, and 60 min exposure to atmospheric oxygen as well as the cultivation of B. fragilis after 30 and 60 min of oxygen exposure. The cultivation in anaerobic box was the most convenient method for growth of C. difficile. In almost all cases, higher growth was observed in nonrecurring cultivation system than in the system of anaerobic jar. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed among these anaerobic cultivation systems which confirmed their applicability (taking into account some individual features concerning the optimization of cultivations) for identification of pathogenic anaerobes.
TI  - Longitudinal study of Clostridium difficile and antimicrobial susceptibility of Escherichia coli in healthy horses in a community setting.
AB  - Point prevalence studies have reported carriage rates of enteric pathogens in healthy horses, but longitudinal data are lacking. Commensal E. coli is an indicator organism to evaluate antimicrobial resistance of enteric bacteria, yet there are limited data for horses. The objectives of this study were to investigate and molecularly characterize isolates of Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella, collected sequentially over a one year period, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profile for E. coli. Fecal samples were collected monthly from 25 adult horses for one year. Selective cultures were performed for all above bacteria. C. difficile isolates were characterized via PCR toxin gene profiling and ribotyping. Broth microdilution was performed to assess antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of E. coli. Toxigenic Clostridium difficile was isolated from 15/275 (5.45%) samples from 10/25 (40%) horses. Four horses were positive at multiple sampling times but different ribotypes were found in three. Ribotypes included 078 (n=6), 001 (n=6) and C (n=3). C. perfringens was not isolated, nor was Salmonella. E. coli was isolated from 232/300 (77%) fecal samples. Resistance to >/= 1 and >/= 3 antimicrobials was present in 31/232 (13.4%) and 6/232 (2.6%) respectively. Only two horses shed the same strain of toxigenic C. difficile for more than one month, indicating that shedding is transient. The high number of ribotype 078 is consistent with recent emergence of this strain in the local horse population. The low prevalence of antibiotic resistance in commensal E. coli suggests that healthy horses are not likely a major reservoir of resistance for enteric bacteria.
TI  - Clostridium difficile MazF toxin exhibits selective, not global, mRNA cleavage.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is an important, emerging nosocomial pathogen. The transition from harmless colonization to disease is typically preceded by antimicrobial therapy, which alters the balance of the intestinal flora, enabling C. difficile to proliferate in the colon. One of the most perplexing aspects of the C. difficile infectious cycle is its ability to survive antimicrobial therapy and transition from inert colonization to active infection. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems have been implicated in facilitating persistence after antibiotic treatment. We identified only one TA system in C. difficile strain 630 (epidemic type X), designated MazE-cd and MazF-cd, a counterpart of the well-characterized Escherichia coli MazEF TA system. This E. coli MazF toxin cleaves mRNA at ACA sequences, leading to global mRNA degradation, growth arrest, and death. Likewise, MazF-cd expression in E. coli or Clostridium perfringens resulted in growth arrest. Primer extension analysis revealed that MazF-cd cleaved RNA at the five-base consensus sequence UACAU, suggesting that the mRNAs susceptible to cleavage comprise a subset of total mRNAs. In agreement, we observed differential cleavage of several mRNAs by MazF-cd in vivo, revealing a direct correlation between the number of cleavage recognition sites within a given transcript and its susceptibility to degradation by MazF-cd. Interestingly, upon detailed statistical analyses of the C. difficile transcriptome, the major C. difficile virulence factor toxin B (TcdB) and CwpV, a cell wall protein involved in aggregation, were predicted to be significantly resistant to MazF-cd cleavage.
TI  - Bidirectional attack on the actin cytoskeleton. Bacterial protein toxins causing  polymerization or depolymerization of actin.
AB  - The actin cytoskeleton is one of the major targets of bacterial protein toxins. The family of binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins, including Clostridium difficile transferase CDT, Clostridium perfringens iota toxin and Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, modifies arginine-177 of actin. Thereby actin polymerization is blocked. By contrast, actin polymerization is facilitated by the tripartite Photorhabdus luminescens toxin complex including TccC3, which modifies actin at threonine-148. The review discusses both toxin families in respect to recent findings.
TI  - FK506-binding protein 51 interacts with Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin and FK506  inhibits membrane translocation of the toxin in mammalian cells.
AB  - The binary Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin consists of the binding/translocation component C2IIa and the separate enzyme component C2I. C2IIa delivers C2I into the cytosol of eukaryotic target cells where C2I ADP-ribosylates actin. After receptor-mediated endocytosis of the C2IIa/C2I complex, C2IIa forms pores in membranes of acidified early endosomes and unfolded C2I translocates through the pores into the cytosol. Membrane translocation of C2I is facilitated by the activities of host cell chaperone Hsp90 and the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) cyclophilin A. Here, we demonstrated that Hsp90 co-precipitates with C2I from lysates of C2 toxin-treated cells and identified the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 51 as a novel interaction partner of C2I in vitro and in intact mammalian cells. Prompted by this finding, we used the specific pharmacological inhibitor FK506 to investigate whether the PPIase activity of FKBPs plays a role during membrane translocation of C2 toxin. Treatment of cells with FK506 protected cultured cells from intoxication with C2 toxin. Moreover, FK506 inhibited the pH-dependent translocation of C2I across membranes into the cytosol but did not interfere with the enzyme activity of C2I or binding of C2 toxin to cells. Furthermore, FK506 treatment delayed intoxication with the related binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins from Clostridium perfringens (iota toxin) and Clostridium difficile (CDT) but not with the Rho-glucosylating Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA). In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that clostridial binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins share a specific FKBP-dependent translocation mechanism during their uptake into mammalian cells.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of LFF571 against Clostridium difficile and 630 other intestinal strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of LFF571, a novel analog of GE2270A that inhibits bacterial growth by binding with high affinity for protein synthesis elongation factor Tu, fidaxomicin, and 10 other antimicrobial agents were determined against 50 strains of Clostridium difficile and 630 other anaerobic and aerobic organisms of intestinal origin. LFF571 possesses potent activity against C. difficile and most other Gram-positive anaerobes (MIC(90), </= 0.25 mug/ml), with the exception of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. The MIC(90)s for aerobes, including enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus (as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, and other streptococci were 0.06, 0.125, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. Comparatively, fidaxomicin showed variable activity against Gram-positive organisms: MIC(90)s against C. difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Bifidobacterium spp. were 0.5, </= 0.015, and 0.125 mug/ml, respectively, but >32 mug/ml against Clostridium ramosum and Clostridium innocuum. MIC(90) for S. pyogenes and other streptococci was 16 and >32 mug/ml, respectively. LFF571 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes.
TI  - Identification of the cellular receptor of Clostridium spiroforme toxin.
AB  - Clostridium spiroforme produces the binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxin CST (C. spiroforme toxin), which has been proposed to be responsible for diarrhea, enterocolitis, and eventually death, especially in rabbits. Here we report on the recombinant production of the enzyme component (CSTa) and the binding component (CSTb) of C. spiroforme toxin in Bacillus megaterium. By using the recombinant toxin components, we show that CST enters target cells via the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR), which has been recently identified as the host cell receptor of the binary toxins Clostridium difficile transferase (CDT) and Clostridium perfringens iota toxin. Microscopic studies revealed that CST, but not the related Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, colocalized with LSR during toxin uptake and traffic to endosomal compartments. Our findings indicate that CST shares LSR with C. difficile CDT and C. perfringens iota toxin as a host cell surface receptor.
TI  - Prevalence of selected bacterial and parasitic agents in feces from diarrheic and healthy control cats from Northern California.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial and parasitic agents are commonly implicated as causes of diarrhea in cats, but there is a paucity of information evaluating epidemiological and prevalence factors associated with most of these organisms in cats. OBJECTIVES: Determine the prevalence of selected enteropathogens in diarrheic and nondiarrheic cats. ANIMALS: A total of 219 diarrheic and 54 nondiarrheic cats. METHODS: Prospective study. Fresh fecal specimens were submitted for centrifugation flotation, culture, ELISA (Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin [CPE], and C. difficile toxin A [TcdA]) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (Tritrichomonas foetus and Campylobacter spp.). An epidemiologic questionnaire was completed for each cat. RESULTS: Campylobacter was isolated from significantly fewer diarrheic (21/219 or 9.6%) versus nondiarrheic cats (15/54 or 27.8%, P = .001), and was detected in 74 of 131 cats (56.5%) via PCR. Campylobacter jejuni, C. helveticus, and C. upsaliensis were detected in 6.8, 100, and 44.6% of the 74 cats. Multiple Campylobacter spp. were identified in 47.3% of these cats. All cats were negative on fecal culture for Salmonella and for C. difficile TcdA via ELISA. CPE was detected in 9/219 diarrheic (4.1%) and in 1/54 nondiarrheic cats (1.9%, P = .69). Cats < 2 years were significantly more likely to be infected with intestinal parasites (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Routine fecal cultures and toxin immunoassays for detection of bacteria are of limited diagnostic value in diarrheic cats. Molecular-based testing is superior to fecal cultures for detection and identification of Campylobacter spp., but positive test results do not correlate to the presence of disease.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens type C and Clostridium difficile co-infection in foals.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens type C is one of the most important agents of enteric disease in newborn foals. Clostridium difficile is now recognized as an important cause of enterocolitis in horses of all ages. While infections by C. perfringens type C or C. difficile are frequently seen, we are not aware of any report describing combined infection by these two microorganisms in foals. We present here five cases of foal enterocolitis associated with C. difficile and C. perfringens type C infection. Five foals between one and seven days of age were submitted for necropsy examination to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory. The five animals had a clinical history of acute hemorrhagic diarrhea followed by death and none had received antimicrobials or been hospitalized. Postmortem examination revealed hemorrhagic and necrotizing entero-typhlo-colitis. Histologically, the mucosa of the small intestine and colon presented diffuse necrosis and hemorrhage and it was often covered by a pseudomembrane. Thrombosis was observed in submucosal and/or mucosal vessels. Immunohistochemistry of intestinal sections of all foals showed that many large bacilli in the sections were C. perfringens. C. perfringens beta toxin was detected by ELISA in intestinal content of all animals and C. difficile toxin A/B was detected in intestinal content of three animals. C. perfringens (identified as type C by PCR) was isolated from the intestinal content of three foals. C. difficile (typed as A(+)/B(+) by PCR) was isolated from the intestinal content in 3 out of the 5 cases. This report suggests a possible synergism of C. perfringens type C and C. difficile in foal enterocolitis. Because none of the foals had received antibiotic therapy, the predisposing factor, if any, for the C. difficile infection remains undetermined; it is possible that the C. perfringens infection acted as a predisposing factor for C. difficile and/or vice versa. This report also stresses the need to perform a complete diagnostic workup in all cases of foal digestive disease.
TI  - [Pathogenicity factors of bacteria with glycosylating activity].
AB  - A and B toxins of Clostridium difficile, a-toxin of C. novyi, lehal toxin of C. sordellii, and TpeL toxin of C. perfringens belong to the group of the so-called large Clostridium toxins. These toxins modify low-molecular weight guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins of the Rho/Ras family by their glycosylation that results in inactivation of major signal pathways in eukaryotic cells. Lgt glycosyltransferases, a new group of pathogenicity factors also capable of inactivating eukaryotic substrates via glycosylation, have recently been identified in Legionella. They are transported into cytoplasm of eukaryotic target cells by type 4 secretory system of Legionella. After translocation, the enzyme inhibits protein synthesis by attaching glucose residue to Ser53 of 1A elongation factor. The available data suggest an important role of bacterial glycosylating factors in the action of pathogens causing infectious diseases.
TI  - Enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats: diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control.
AB  - This report offers a consensus opinion on the diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control of the primary enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats, with an emphasis on Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli associated with granulomatous colitis in Boxers. Veterinarians are challenged when attempting to diagnose animals with suspected bacterial-associated diarrhea because well-scrutinized practice guidelines that provide objective recommendations for implementing fecal testing are lacking. This problem is compounded by similar isolation rates for putative bacterial enteropathogens in animals with and without diarrhea, and by the lack of consensus among veterinary diagnostic laboratories as to which diagnostic assays should be utilized. Most bacterial enteropathogens are associated with self-limiting diarrhea, and injudicious administration of antimicrobials could be more harmful than beneficial. Salmonella and Campylobacter are well-documented zoonoses, but antimicrobial administration is not routinely advocated in uncomplicated cases and supportive therapy is recommended. Basic practices of isolation, use of appropriate protective equipment, and proper cleaning and disinfection are the mainstays of control. Handwashing with soap and water is preferred over use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers because spores of C. difficile and C. perfringens are alcohol-resistant, but susceptible to bleach (1:10 to 1:20 dilution of regular household bleach) and accelerated hydrogen peroxide. The implementation of practice guidelines in combination with the integration of validated molecular-based testing and conventional testing is pivotal if we are to optimize the identification and management of enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats.
TI  - Gas discharge plasmas are effective in inactivating Bacillus and Clostridium spores.
AB  - Bacterial spores are the most resistant form of life and have been a major threat to public health and food safety. Nonthermal atmospheric gas discharge plasma is a novel sterilization method that leaves no chemical residue. In our study, a helium radio-frequency cold plasma jet was used to examine its sporicidal effect on selected strains of Bacillus and Clostridium. The species tested included Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium botulinum type A and type E. The plasmas were effective in inactivating selected Bacillus and Clostridia spores with D values (decimal reduction time) ranging from 2 to 8 min. Among all spores tested, C. botulinum type A and C. sporogenes were significantly more resistant to plasma inactivation than other species. Observations by phase contrast microscopy showed that B. subtilis spores were severely damaged by plasmas and the majority of the treated spores were unable to initiate the germination process. There was no detectable fragmentation of the DNA when the spores were treated for up to 20 min. The release of dipicolinic acid was observed almost immediately after the plasma treatment, indicating the spore envelope damage could occur quickly resulting in dipicolinic acid release and the reduction of spore resistance.
TI  - Recognition of greater diversity of Bacillus species and related bacteria in human faeces.
AB  - In a study looking at culturable aerobic Actinobacteria associated with the human gastrointestinal tract, the vast majority of isolates obtained from dried human faeces belonged to the genus Bacillus and related bacteria. A total of 124 isolates were recovered from the faeces of 10 healthy adult donors. 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses showed the majority belonged to the families Bacillaceae (n=81) and Paenibacillaceae (n=3), with Bacillus species isolated from all donors. Isolates tentatively identified as Bacillus clausii (n=32) and Bacillus licheniformis (n=28) were recovered most frequently, with the genera Lysinibacillus, Ureibacillus, Oceanobacillus, Ornithinibacillus and Virgibacillus represented in some donors. Phenotypic data confirmed the identities of isolates belonging to well-characterized species. Representatives of the phylum Actinobacteria were recovered in much lower numbers (n=11). Many of the bacilli exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more strains of Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, with some (n=12) found to have no detectable cytopathic effect on HEp-2 cells. This study has revealed greater diversity within gut-associated aerobic spore-formers than previous studies, and suggests that bacilli with potential as probiotics could be isolated from the human gut.
TI  - Development and characterization of a xylose-inducible gene expression system for Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A xylose-inducible gene expression vector for Clostridium perfringens was developed. Plasmid pXCH contains a chromosomal region from Clostridium difficile (xylR-P(xy)(lB)): xylR, encoding the xylose repressor, xylO, the xyl operator sequence, and P(xylB), the divergent promoter upstream of xylBA encoding xylulo kinase and xylose isomerase. pXCH allows tightly regulated expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter and the alpha-toxin genes in response to the inducer concentration. Thus, pXCH could constitute a new valuable genetic tool for study of C. perfringens.
TI  - Lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) is the host receptor for the binary toxin Clostridium difficile transferase (CDT).
AB  - Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. Hypervirulent strains of the pathogen, which are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality of CDI, produce the binary actin-ADP ribosylating toxin Clostridium difficile transferase (CDT) in addition to the Rho-glucosylating toxins A and B. CDT depolymerizes the actin cytoskeleton, increases adherence and colonization of Clostridia by induction of microtubule-based cell protrusions and, eventually, causes death of target cells. Using a haploid genetic screen, we identified the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor as the membrane receptor for CDT uptake by target cells. Moreover, we show that Clostridium perfringens iota toxin, which is a related binary actin-ADP ribosylating toxin, enters target cells via the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor. Identification of the toxin receptors is essential for understanding of the toxin uptake and provides a most valuable basis for antitoxin strategies.
TI  - ClosTron-mediated engineering of Clostridium.
AB  - The genus Clostridium is a diverse assemblage of Gram positive, anaerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. Whilst certain species have achieved notoriety as important animal and human pathogens (e.g. Clostridium difficile, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium tetani, and Clostridium perfringens), the vast majority of the genus are entirely benign, and are able to undertake all manner of useful biotransformations. Prominent amongst them are those species able to produce the biofuels, butanol and ethanol from biomass-derived residues, such as Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium beijerinkii, Clostridium thermocellum, and Clostridium phytofermentans. The prominence of the genus in disease and biotechnology has led to the need for more effective means of genetic modification. The historical absence of methods based on conventional strategies for "knock-in" and "knock-out" in Clostridium has led to the adoption of recombination-independent procedures, typified by ClosTron technology. The ClosTron uses a retargeted group II intron and a retro-transposition-activated marker to selectively insert DNA into defined sites within the genome, to bring about gene inactivation and/or cargo DNA delivery. The procedure is extremely efficient, rapid, and requires minimal effort by the operator.
TI  - Membrane translocation of binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins from Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens is facilitated by cyclophilin A and Hsp90.
AB  - Some hypervirulent strains of Clostridium difficile produce the binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxin C. difficile transferase (CDT) in addition to Rho-glucosylating toxins A and B. It has been suggested that the presence of CDT increases the severity of C. difficile-associated diseases, including pseudomembranous colitis. CDT contains a binding and translocation component, CDTb, that mediates the transport of the separate enzyme component CDTa into the cytosol of target cells, where CDTa modifies actin. Here we investigated the mechanism of cellular CDT uptake and found that bafilomycin A1 protects cultured epithelial cells from intoxication with CDT, implying that CDTa is translocated from acidified endosomal vesicles into the cytosol. Consistently, CDTa is translocated across the cytoplasmic membranes into the cytosol when cell-bound CDT is exposed to acidic medium. Radicicol and cyclosporine A, inhibitors of the heat shock protein Hsp90 and cyclophilins, respectively, protected cells from intoxication with CDT but not from intoxication with toxins A and B. Moreover, both inhibitors blocked the pH-dependent membrane translocation of CDTa, strongly suggesting that Hsp90 and cyclophilin are crucial for this process. In contrast, the inhibitors did not interfere with the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, receptor binding, or endocytosis of the toxin. We obtained comparable results with the closely related iota-toxin from Clostridium perfringens. Moreover, CDTa and Ia, the enzyme component of iota-toxin, specifically bound to immobilized Hsp90 and cyclophilin A in vitro. In combination with our recently obtained data on the C2 toxin from C. botulinum, these results imply a common Hsp90/cyclophilin A-dependent translocation mechanism for the family of binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins.
TI  - Bacterial enteritis in dogs and cats: diagnosis, therapy, and zoonotic potential.
AB  - A variety of bacteria are known or suspected of being able to cause enteritis in  dogs and cats. Campylobacter spp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella spp are most commonly implicated, but many other organisms are likely involved. Poor understanding of the intestinal microflora and the fact that many, if not all, of these microorganisms can also be found in healthy individuals complicates testing, thereby affecting the use of specific treatments and assessment of potential infection control and zoonotic disease risks. An understanding of the strengths and limitations of various diagnostic options is important for the management of canine and feline enteritis.
TI  - Determinants of the human infant intestinal microbiota after the introduction of  first complementary foods in infant samples from five European centres.
AB  - Although it is well established that early infant feeding has a major influence on the establishment of the gut microbiota, very little is understood about how the introduction of first solid food influences the colonization process. This study aimed to determine the impact of weaning on the faecal microbiota composition of infants from five European countries (Sweden, Scotland, Germany, Italy and Spain) which have different lifestyle characteristics and infant feeding practices. Faecal samples were collected from 605 infants approximately 4 weeks after the introduction of first solid foods and the results were compared with the same infants before weaning (6 weeks of age) to investigate the association with determining factors such as geographical origin, mode of delivery, previous feeding method and age of weaning. Samples were analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry using a panel of 10 rRNA targeted group- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes. The genus Bifidobacterium (36.5 % average proportion of total detectable bacteria), Clostridium coccoides group (14 %) and Bacteroides (13.6 %) were predominant after weaning. Similar to pre-weaning, northern European countries were associated with a higher proportion of bifidobacteria in the infant gut microbiota while higher levels of Bacteroides and lactobacilli characterized southern European countries. As before weaning, the initial feeding method influenced the Clostridium leptum group and Clostridium difficile+Clostridium perfringens species, and bifidobacteria still dominated the faeces of initially breast-fed infants. Formula-fed babies presented significantly higher proportions of Bacteroides and the C. coccoides group. The mode of birth influenced changes in the proportions of bacteroides and atopobium. Although there were significant differences in the mean weaning age between countries, this was not related to the populations of bifidobacteria or bacteroides. Thus, although the faecal microbiota of infants after first complementary foods was different to that before weaning commenced, many of the initial influences on microbiota composition were still evident.
TI  - Germination response of spores of the pathogenic bacterium Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile to cultured human epithelial cells.
AB  - Spores of pathogenic Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile must germinate in the food vehicle and/or host's intestinal tract to cause disease. In this work, we examined the germination response of spores of C. perfringens and C. difficile upon incubation with cultured human epithelial cell lines (Caco-2, HeLa and HT-29). C. perfringens spores of various sources were able to germinate to different extents; while spores of a non-food-borne isolate germinated very well, spores of food-borne and animal isolates germinated poorly in human epithelial cells. In contrast, no detectable spore germination (i.e., loss of spore heat resistance) was observed upon incubation of C. difficile spores with epithelial cells; instead, there was a significant (p < 0.01) increase in heat-resistant spore titers. In C. perfringens, the highest spore germination response observed with the HT-29 cell line, might be in part, due to the expression of germination factor with peptidoglycan cortex hydrolysis activity by HT-29 cells. Collectively, these findings might well have implications in understanding the mechanism of clostridial spore germination in vivo.
TI  - Intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis B virus infection. Intestinal microbiota of HBV cirrhotic patients.
AB  - To unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in Chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis B virus (HBV), chronic hepatitis B, decompensated HBV cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative PCR and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium perfringens in fecal crude DNA and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. Data analysis indicated that 16S rRNA gene copy numbers for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of HBV cirrhotic patients. The Bifidobacteria/Enterobacteriaceae (B/E) ratio, which may indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis B to 0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated HBV cirrhosis (for all, P < 0.01). This suggests that B/E ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. The data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. Fecal secretory IgA and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated HBV cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.
TI  - Small RNAs in the genus Clostridium.
AB  - The genus Clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not been investigated in clostridia. Research on sRNAs in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify sRNA candidates, thus delegating clostridial sRNA research to a hit-and-miss process. Thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential sRNAs in the Clostridium genus to open up the field of sRNA research in clostridia. Using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted sRNAs in 21 clostridial genomes: Clostridium acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, C. botulinum (eight strains), C. cellulolyticum, C. difficile, C. kluyveri (two strains), C. novyi, C. perfringens (three strains), C. phytofermentans, C. tetani, and C. thermocellum. Although more than one-third of predicted sRNAs have Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of SD sequences; thus, most of the predicted sRNAs are noncoding RNAs. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) and Northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of sRNAs in C. acetobutylicum and several C. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested sRNAs. We identified a conserved, novel sRNA which, together with the downstream gene coding for an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. The number of predicted sRNAs correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic, and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16S rRNA-based phylogeny.
TI  - Clostridial binary toxins: iota and C2 family portraits.
AB  - There are many pathogenic Clostridium species with diverse virulence factors that include protein toxins. Some of these bacteria, such as C. botulinum, C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. spiroforme, cause enteric problems in animals as well as humans. These often fatal diseases can partly be attributed to binary protein toxins that follow a classic AB paradigm. Within a targeted cell, all clostridial binary toxins destroy filamentous actin via mono-ADP-ribosylation of globular actin by the A component. However, much less is known about B component binding to cell-surface receptors. These toxins share sequence homology amongst themselves and with those produced by another Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium also commonly associated with soil and disease: Bacillus anthracis. This review focuses upon the iota and C2 families of clostridial binary toxins and includes: (1) basics of the bacterial source; (2) toxin biochemistry; (3) sophisticated cellular uptake machinery; and (4) host-cell responses following toxin-mediated disruption of the cytoskeleton. In summary, these protein toxins aid diverse enteric species within the genus Clostridium.
TI  - Fecal lactoferrin and Clostridium spp. in stools of autistic children.
AB  - Stools from autistic and healthy children were studied for fecal lactoferrin, Clostridium difficile toxins, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and cultured for Clostridium spp. Elevated level of FLA was demonstrated in 24.4% stools, all from boys (31.25%). No toxins were detected. Clostridium spp. was isolated with similar frequency from all samples. C. perfringens were isolated significantly often from the autistic stools, intermediate sensitive strains to penicillin 19%, to clindamycin 11.3%, and to metronidazole 7.5% were detected. Further studies on fecal microflora and inflammatory mediators, with larger groups of patients, are required in order to explain their role in neurological deficits.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens TpeL glycosylates the Rac and Ras subfamily proteins.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens TpeL belongs to a family of large clostridial cytotoxins  that encompasses Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL). We report here the identification of the TpeL-catalyzed modification of small GTPases. A recombinant protein (TpeL1-525) derived from the TpeL N-terminal catalytic domain in the presence of streptolysin O (SLO) induced the rounding of Vero cells and the glycosylation of cellular Rac1. Among several hexoses tested, UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) served as cosubstrates for TpeL1-525-catalyzed modifications. TpeL1-525 catalyzed the incorporation of UDP-Glc into Ha-Ras, Rap1B, and RalA and of UDP-GlcNAc into Rac1, Ha-Ras, Rap1B, and RalA. In Rac1, TpeL and TcdB share the same acceptor amino acid for glycosylation, Thr-35. In Vero cells treated with TpeL1-525 in the presence of SLO, glycosylation leads to a translocation of the majority of Rac1 and Ha-Ras to the membrane. We demonstrate for first time that TpeL uses both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Glc as donor cosubstrates and modifies the Rac1 and Ras subfamily by glycosylation to mediate its cytotoxic effects.
TI  - Prevalence and diversity of toxigenic Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile among swine herds in the midwest.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile are associated with scours in the neonatal piglet and are an economic concern in swine production. The objective of this study was to characterize the prevalence and diversity of C. perfringens and C. difficile isolates obtained from scouring neonatal piglets in a large integrated production system, as well as in smaller independently owned regional farms. Rectal swabs were collected from 333 pigs at 11 sites in an integrated swine production system and from an additional 180 pigs at 16 regional farms located throughout the Midwest. C. perfringens was isolated from 89.8% of the pigs swabbed at the integrated sites, and C. difficile was isolated from 57.7% of these pigs. Of the pigs from the regional farms sampled, 95.6% were positive for isolation of C. perfringens and 27.2% were positive for C. difficile. Toxigenic isolates were typed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR, and were placed in four dendrograms for C. perfringens and C. difficile populations isolated from the integrated sites and regional farms. Diversity indices showed that there was greater diversity in C. difficile populations and in populations isolated from the regional farms. A subset of isolates from the C. difficile dendrograms were further toxinotyped by amplification of the pathogenicity locus and subsequent digestion by HincII, AccI, and EcoRI. Of the 45 isolates typed, 44 were determined to be toxinotype V. The results of this study illustrate the diversity of C. perfringens and C. difficile isolates and the prevalence of these pathogens in swine production sites.
TI  - SleC is essential for germination of Clostridium difficile spores in nutrient-rich medium supplemented with the bile salt taurocholate.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is the major cause of infectious diarrhea and a major burden to health care services. The ability of this organism to form endospores plays a pivotal role in infection and disease transmission. Spores are highly resistant to many forms of disinfection and thus are able to persist on hospital surfaces and disseminate infection. In order to cause disease, the spores must germinate and the organism must grow vegetatively. Spore germination in Bacillus is well understood, and genes important for this process have recently been identified in Clostridium perfringens; however, little is known about C. difficile. Apparent homologues of the spore cortex lytic enzyme genes cwlJ and sleB (Bacillus subtilis) and sleC (C. perfringens) are present in the C. difficile genome, and we describe inactivation of these homologues in C. difficile 630Delta erm and a B1/NAP1/027 clinical isolate. Spores of a sleC mutant were unable to form colonies when germination was induced with taurocholate, although decoated sleC spores formed the same number of heat-resistant colonies as the parental control, even in the absence of germinants. This suggests that sleC is absolutely required for conversion of spores to vegetative cells, in contrast to CD3563 (a cwlJ/sleB homologue), inactivation of which had no effect on germination and outgrowth of C. difficile spores under the same conditions. The B1/NAP1/027 strain R20291 was found to sporulate more slowly and produce fewer spores than 630Delta erm. Furthermore, fewer R20291 spores germinated, indicating that there are differences in both sporulation and germination between these epidemic and nonepidemic C. difficile isolates.
TI  - Prevalence of diarrhea and enteropathogens in racing sled dogs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is highly prevalent in racing sled dogs, although the underlying causes are poorly understood. HYPOTHESIS: Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and Clostridium difficile Toxin A and B are associated with diarrhea in racing sled dogs. ANIMALS: One hundred and thirty-five sled dogs. METHODS: Freshly voided feces were obtained from 55 dogs before racing and from 80 dogs after 400 miles of racing. Samples were visually scored for diarrhea, mucus, blood, and melena. CPE and C. difficile Toxin A and B were detected by ELISA. Samples were cultured for C. perfringens, C. difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli O157; Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. were detected via immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Diarrhea occurred in 36% of dogs during racing, and hematochezia, fecal mucus or melena, or all 3 occurred in 57.5% of dogs. Salmonella was isolated from 78.2% of dogs before racing, and from 71.3% of dogs during racing. C. perfringens and C. difficile were isolated from 100 and 58.2% of dogs before racing, and from 95 and 36.3% of dogs during racing. Dogs were more likely to test positive for CPE during than before racing (18.8 versus 5.5%, P = .021); however, no enteropathogens or their respective toxins were significantly associated with hematochezia or diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Sled dogs participating in long distance racing have a high prevalence of diarrhea and hematochezia that is not associated with common enteropathogens. It is possible that diarrhea and hematochezia represent the effect of prolonged exercise on the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - [Antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to Clostridium perfringens].
AB  - A 40-year-old man undergoing allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for chronic myelogenous leukemia and developing diarrhea was administered prophylactic antibiotics including levofloxacin, fluconazole, cotrimoxazole, and vancomycin. Stool specimens were positive for toxin A in enzyme immunoassay but negative for toxin B in cell culture assay with a neutralization test, indicating that toxin A detection was false-positive. Stool culture yielded enterotoxin producing Clostridium perfringens, not Clostridium difficile. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the gene encoding C. perfringens enterotoxin in DNA extracted from stool specimens, but not the toxin B gene. Laboratory tests for enterotoxic C. perfingens may therefore be necessary for diagnosing antibiotic-associated diarrhea when culture for C. difficile is negative.
TI  - Clostridium difficile toxin CDT induces formation of microtubule-based protrusions and increases adherence of bacteria.
AB  - Clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous  colitis by production of the Rho GTPase-glucosylating toxins A and B. Recently emerging hypervirulent Clostridium difficile strains additionally produce the binary ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin CDT (Clostridium difficile transferase), which ADP-ribosylates actin and inhibits actin polymerization. Thus far, the role of CDT as a virulence factor is not understood. Here we report by using time-lapse- and immunofluorescence microscopy that CDT and other binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins, including Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin and Clostridium perfringens iota toxin, induce redistribution of microtubules and formation of long (up to >150 microm) microtubule-based protrusions at the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. The toxins increase the length of decoration of microtubule plus-ends by EB1/3, CLIP-170 and CLIP-115 proteins and cause redistribution of the capture proteins CLASP2 and ACF7 from microtubules at the cell cortex into the cell interior. The CDT-induced microtubule protrusions form a dense meshwork at the cell surface, which wrap and embed bacterial cells, thereby largely increasing the adherence of Clostridia. The study describes a novel type of microtubule structure caused by less efficient microtubule capture and offers a new perspective for the pathogenetic role of CDT and other binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins in host-pathogen interactions.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activities of Sinapis alba L. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. breve, B. longum, Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and L. casei. The active component of S. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and HPLC and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. The antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. Phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of C. difficile and C. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. Furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of E. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and E. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. In conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Infectious agents detected in the feces of diarrheic foals: a retrospective study of 233 cases (2003-2008).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is common in foals but there are no studies investigating the relative prevalence of common infectious agents in a population of hospitalized diarrheic foals. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of detection of infectious agents in a population of hospitalized foals with diarrhea and to determine if detection of specific pathogens is associated with age, outcome, or clinicopathologic data. ANIMALS: Two hundred and thirty-three foals < or = 10 months of age with diarrhea examined at a referral institution. METHODS: Retrospective case series. Each foal was examined for Salmonella spp., viruses, Clostridium difficile toxins, Clostridium perfringens culture, C. perfringens enterotoxin, Cryptosporidium spp., and metazoan parasites in feces collected at admission or at the onset of diarrhea. RESULTS: At least 1 infectious agent was detected in 122 foals (55%). Rotavirus was most frequently detected (20%) followed by C. perfringens (18%), Salmonella spp. (12%), and C. difficile (5%). Foals < 1 month of age were significantly more likely to be positive for C. perfringens (odds ratio [OR] = 15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.5-66) or to have negative fecal diagnostic results (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.7-5.2) than older foals. Foals > 1 month of age were significantly more likely to have Salmonella spp. (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.2-6.0), rotavirus (OR = 13.3, 95% CI = 5.3-33), and parasites (OR = 23, 95% CI = 3.1-185) detected compared with younger foals. Overall 191 of the 223 foals (87%) survived. The type of infectious agent identified in the feces or bacteremia was not significantly associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In the population studied, foals with diarrhea had a good prognosis regardless of which infectious agent was identified in the feces.
TI  - Enteric bacterial pathogen detection in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) is associated with coastal urbanization and freshwater runoff.
AB  - Although protected for nearly a century, California's sea otters have been slow to recover, in part due to exposure to fecally-associated protozoal pathogens like Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona. However, potential impacts from exposure to fecal bacteria have not been systematically explored. Using selective media, we examined feces from live and dead sea otters from California for specific enteric bacterial pathogens (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile and Escherichia coli O157:H7), and pathogens endemic to the marine environment (Vibrio cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus and Plesiomonas shigelloides). We evaluated statistical associations between detection of these pathogens in otter feces and demographic or environmental risk factors for otter exposure, and found that dead otters were more likely to test positive for C. perfringens, Campylobacter and V. parahaemolyticus than were live otters. Otters from more urbanized coastlines and areas with high freshwater runoff (near outflows of rivers or streams) were more likely to test positive for one or more of these bacterial pathogens. Other risk factors for bacterial detection in otters included male gender and fecal samples collected during the rainy season when surface runoff is maximal. Similar risk factors were reported in prior studies of pathogen exposure for California otters and their invertebrate prey, suggesting that land-sea transfer and/or facilitation of pathogen survival in degraded coastal marine habitat may be impacting sea otter recovery. Because otters and humans share many of the same foods, our findings may also have implications for human health.
TI  - Structural basis for substrate recognition in the enzymatic component of ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin CDTa from Clostridium difficile.
AB  - ADP-ribosylation is one of the favored modes of cell intoxication employed by several bacteria. Clostridium difficile is recognized to be an important nosocomial pathogen associated with considerable morbidity and attributable mortality. Along with its two well known toxins, Toxin A and Toxin B, it produces an ADP-ribosylating toxin that targets monomeric actin of the target cell. Like other Clostridial actin ADP-ribosylating toxins, this binary toxin, known as C. difficile toxin (CDT), is composed of two subunits, CDTa and CDTb. In this study, we present high resolution crystal structures of CDTa in its native form (at pH 4.0, 8.5, and 9.0) and in complex with ADP-ribose donors, NAD and NADPH (at pH 9.0). The crystal structures of the native protein show "pronounced conformational flexibility" confined to the active site region of the protein and "enhanced" disorder at low pH, whereas the complex structures highlight significant differences in "ligand specificity" compared with the enzymatic subunit of a close homologue, Clostridium perfringens iota toxin. Specifically in CDTa, two of the suggested catalytically important residues (Glu-385 and Glu-387) seem to play no role or a less important role in ligand binding. These structural data provide the first detailed information on protein-donor substrate complex stabilization in CDTa, which may have implications in understanding CDT recognition.
TI  - Clostridia as agents of zoonotic disease.
AB  - Clostridia are not normally considered to be zoonotic pathogens, although many species affect both humans and domestic animals. Three cases in which organisms occur, possibly via direct or indirect transmission, in both food animals and humans are considered here. Strains of Clostridium perfringens that produce enterotoxin (CPE) are typically transmitted to humans in contaminated, improperly handled foods. Pathogenesis is based upon action of CPE in the intestine, and disease is usually self-limiting. Infection of domestic animals by CPE-producing C. perfringens is uncommon. C. perfringens type C is best known as a pathogen of neonatal domestic animals, which acquire the infection from the dam. The course may be peracute, and prevention by vaccination of the dam is universally advocated. Humans consuming meat contaminated with type C may develop enteritis necroticans, with segmental hemorrhagic and necrotic jejunitis, which must usually be treated by bowel resection. Clostridium difficile is a pathogen of both humans and domestic animals. Examination of retail meats by bacteriologic culture has revealed genotypes of C. difficile that in many cases are identical to those from food animals and diseased humans. Transmission, food animals to foods to humans, has not been documented.
TI  - Nosocomial and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea caused by organisms other than Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Most cases of nosocomial and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are caused by alteration of the physiological gut microflora. This alteration leads to reduced microbial metabolism of carbohydrates and primary bile acids, resulting in osmotic or secretory forms of diarrhoea. Moreover, facultative enteropathogens may experience a growth advantage due to the antibiotic-induced microflora alteration that, in turn, can harm the gut mucosa by the toxins they produce. Clostridium difficile is the major infectious agent leading to pseudomembranous colitis. However, there is increasing evidence that certain other pathogens such as enterotoxin-producing Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella oxytoca can induce mucosal deterioration and diarrhoea after antibiotic use. But, as with C. difficile, these facultative enteropathogens can also be found in the healthy population. Their contribution to disease is, therefore, controversial and their presence in the stools of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea patients is often claimed to be mere colonisation. In this respect, the causal relationship of each suspected pathogen with the development of intestinal disease has to be proved clinically and experimentally.
TI  - Assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide CECT7121 against human Gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistant Gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. This work investigated the efficacy of AP-CECT7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121) against various pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: Strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard antibiotic treatments. Inhibitory activity of AP-CECT7121 was assessed using the agar-well diffusion method. The most resistant isolates from each species screened (Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis,Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. RESULTS: These bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus and C. perfringens: viable counts for C. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. CONCLUSIONS: AP-CECT7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - MLST analysis reveals a highly conserved core genome among poultry isolates of Clostridium septicum.
AB  - Clostridium septicum is a highly virulent, anaerobic bacterium capable of establishing necrotizing tissue infections and forming heat resistant endospores. Disease is primarily facilitated by secretion of numerous toxic products including a lethal pore-forming cytolysin. Spontaneously occurring clostridial myonecrosis involving C. septicum has recently reemerged as a concern for many poultry producers. However, despite its increasing prevalence, the epidemiology of infection and population structure of C. septicum remains largely unknown. In this study a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) approach was utilized to examine evolutionary relationships within a diverse collection of C. septicum isolates recovered from poultry flocks experiencing episodes of gangrenous dermatitis. The 109 isolates examined represented 42 turkey flocks and 24 different flocks of broiler chickens as well as C. septicum type strain, ATCC 12464. Isolates were recovered predominantly from gangrenous lesions although isolates from livers, gastrointestinal tracts, spleens and blood were included. The loci analyzed were csa, the major lethal toxin produced by C. septicum, and the housekeeping genes gyrA, groEL, dnaK, recA, tpi, ddl, colA and glpK. These loci were included in part because of their previous use in MLST analysis of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile. Results indicated a high level of conservation present within these housekeeping gene fragments when compared to what has been previously reported for the aforementioned clostridia. Of the 5352 bp of sequence data examined for each isolate, 99.7% (5335/5352) was absolutely conserved among the 109 isolates. Only one of the ten unique sequence types, or allelic profiles, identified among the isolates was recovered from both turkeys and broiler chickens suggesting some host species preference. Phylogenetic analyses identified two unique clusters, or clonal complexes, among these poultry isolates which may have important epidemiological implications for poultry producers in the United States. This work indicates a predominantly clonal population structure for C. septicum although some evidence of recombination was also observed.
TI  - Characterization of Clostridium species utilizing liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of intact proteins.
AB  - A method for biomarker candidate discovery and strain level pathogen characterization using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) with electrospray ionization is described. This method was applied to two pathogenic Clostridium species: C. difficile and C. perfringens. Seven marker proteins per species (fourteen total) were successfully implemented to speciate unknowns during a blind study and could enhance serological and genetic approaches by serving as new targets for detection. Two sets of C. perfringens isolates that were 100% similar by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were distinguished using LC/MS, demonstrating the high specificity of this approach. The use of LC/MS is less labor intensive than PFGE, affords greater specificity than real-time PCR, and requires no primers or antibodies.
TI  - Auranofin disrupts selenium metabolism in Clostridium difficile by forming a stable Au-Se adduct.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a nosocomial pathogen whose incidence and importance are on the rise. Previous work in our laboratory characterized the central role of selenoenzyme-dependent Stickland reactions in C. difficile metabolism. In this work we have identified, using mass spectrometry, a stable complex formed upon reaction of auranofin (a gold-containing drug) with selenide in vitro. X-ray absorption spectroscopy supports the structure that we proposed on the basis of mass-spectrometric data. Auranofin potently inhibits the growth of C. difficile but does not similarly affect other clostridia that do not utilize selenoproteins to obtain energy. Moreover, auranofin inhibits the incorporation of radioisotope selenium ((75)Se) in selenoproteins in both Escherichia coli, the prokaryotic model for selenoprotein synthesis, and C. difficile without impacting total protein synthesis. Auranofin blocks the uptake of selenium and results in the accumulation of the auranofin-selenide adduct in the culture medium. Addition of selenium in the form of selenite or L-selenocysteine to the growth medium significantly reduces the inhibitory action of auranofin on the growth of C. difficile. On the basis of these results, we propose that formation of this complex and the subsequent deficiency in available selenium for selenoprotein synthesis is the mechanism by which auranofin inhibits C. difficile growth. This study demonstrates that targeting selenium metabolism provides a new avenue for antimicrobial development against C. difficile and other selenium-dependent pathogens.
TI  - Epidemiology of Clostridium species bacteremia in Calgary, Canada, 2000-2006.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To define the incidence, risk factors for acquisition, and outcomes associated with clostridial bacteremia in a large Canadian health region. METHODS: Retrospective population-based surveillance for clostridial bacteremia was conducted among all residents of the Calgary Health Region (population 1.2 million) during 2000-2006. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight residents had incident Clostridium species bacteremia (1.8 per 100,000/year); 45 (33%) were nosocomial, 55 (40%) were healthcare-associated community onset, and 38 (28%) were community acquired. Older age and a number of underlying conditions were risk factors for acquiring Clostridium species bacteremia most importantly hemodialysis [relative risk (RR) 212.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 106.5-385.5], malignancy (RR 40.2; 95% CI 27.6-58.1), and Crohn's disease (RR 11.2; 95% CI 3.0-29.4). Clostridium perfringens was most commonly identified with 58 (42%) isolates followed by Clostridium septicum (19; 14%), Clostridium ramosum (13; 9%), Clostridium clostridiiforme (8; 6%), and Clostridium difficile (7; 5%). Reduced susceptibility to penicillin occurred in 14/135 (10%), to metronidazole in 2/135 (1%), and to clindamycin in 36/135 (27%) isolates. The median length of stay was 12.7 days and 39/130 (30%) patients died in hospital for mortality rate of 0.5 per 100,000/year. CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium species bacteremia is associated with a significant burden of illness and hemodialysis and cancer patients are at highest risk.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin in antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens type A is associated with 5-20% cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) even though Clostridium difficile is implicated in the most severe cases. Fecal specimens from one hundred hospitalized patients, who developed diarrhea regardless of antibiotic intake and who were negative for C. difficile toxin assay, were investigated for C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE). Simultaneously, cultures were set up for other possible aetiological factors. Ten healthy controls were also similarly investigated. CPE was positive in 2/100 (2%) of the patients and the samples were also positive for the organism in culture. Other organisms isolated were non-toxigenic C. difficile (4%), staphylococci (6%), Candida (18%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). Stool samples from healthy controls grew mixed growth of no significance and CPE was negative in all of them. Detection of CPE is not part of routine laboratory investigation due to resource implication. Criteria for initiating investigations have to be therefore established by understanding the true burden of C. perfringens-associated AAD by further research.
TI  - Nosocomial diarrhea caused by Clostridium perfringens in the Tsukuba-Tsuchiura district, Japan.
AB  - We examined the incidence of nosocomial diarrhea caused by Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPEnt) in three tertiary hospitals in the Tsukuba-Tsuchiura district, Japan. In addition, isolated strains were genomically characterized. Among 294 stool specimens submitted for C. difficile toxin A (CDTxA) assay during a period of 6 months, 6 (0.42 cases per 1000 beds monthly) and 79 (5.5) were positive for CPEnt and CDTxA, respectively. C. perfringens with the cpe gene was detected in 15 (5%) of the specimens. Genomically indistinguishable strains were isolated from one pair of specimens submitted from one hospital, and from three submitted from different hospitals. Four specimens submitted from one hospital contained C. perfringens with the cpe and the cpb2 genes. We concluded that C. perfringens caused nosocomial diarrhea one-tenth as frequently as C. difficile did in this district, and that strains causing nosocomial diarrhea might have already been acquired in the community.
TI  - Assessing the role of p-cresol tolerance in Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is an important nosocomial pathogen, resulting in antibiotic-associated disease ranging from mild diarrhoea to the life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis. Upon antibiotic exposure, it is believed that the normal bowel microflora of patients is disrupted, allowing C. difficile to proliferate. Significantly, C. difficile is among only a few bacteria able to ferment tyrosine to p-cresol, a phenolic compound that is toxic to other microbes via its ability to interfere with metabolism. Therefore, the ability of different C. difficile strains to produce and tolerate p-cresol may play an important role in the development and severity of C. difficile-associated disease. In this study, it was demonstrated that two C. difficile hypervirulent 027 strains (Stoke Mandeville and BI-16) are more tolerant to p-cresol than other C. difficile strains including 630, CF4 and CD196. Surprising, it was shown that Clostridium sordellii also has a high tolerance to p-cresol, suggesting an overlap in the tolerance pathways in these clostridial species.
TI  - [Detection of clostridia toxin markers in different types of the course of acute  intestinal infections].
AB  - The purpose of the investigation was to study the detection rates of markers and  the level of C. diffcile A and B toxins and C. perfringens type A enterotoxin in patients with acute intestinal infections (AII). Two hundred and seventy-three patients with AII of varying etiology were followed up. According to the clinical syndrome, the patients were divided into 3 groups: (1) patients with the gastroenteritic (GE) type; (2) those with the gastroenterocolitic (GEC) type; (3) those with enterocolitic (EC) type. The circulation of markers of C. difficile A and B toxins and C. perfringens type A enterotoxin was studied, by employing the immunological test systems in the coagglutination test using the plates. The higher levels of antigens of all toxins were identified in the acute period of the disease in the GE and EC types than in the GEC type. There was a short increase in the levels of antigens of the test toxins in the GEC type and a gradual decrease in the GE and EC types. By discharge from hospital, the markers of toxins (more commonly of C. diffcile A) were preserved in 16.4% of the patients mainly in the GEC type.
TI  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea: candidate organisms other than Clostridium difficile.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The direct toxic effects of antibiotics on the intestine can alter digestive functions and cause pathogenic bacterial overgrowth leading to antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is widely known to be responsible for 10 approximately 20% of AAD cases. However, Klebsiella oxytoca, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida species might also contribute to AAD. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed the organisms in stool and colon tissue cultures with a C. difficile toxin A assay in patients with AAD between May and December 2005. In addition, we performed the C. difficile toxin A assays using an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay technique. Patients were enrolled who had diarrhea with more than three stools per day for at least 2 days after the initiation of antibiotic treatment for up to 6 approximately 8 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation. RESULTS: Among 38 patients (mean age 59 +/- 18 years, M:F =18:20), the organism isolation rates were 28.9% (11/38) for stool culture, 18.4% (7/38) for colon tissue cultures and 13.2% (5/38) for the C. difficile toxin A assay. The overall rate of identification of organisms was 50.0% (19/38). Of the five patients that had a positive result by the C. difficile toxin A assay, two had no organism isolated by the stool or colon tissue culture. The organisms isolated from the stool cultures were C difficile (4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (3), Candida species (3), and Staphylococcus aureus (1). C. difficile (4) and K. pneumoniae (3) were isolated from the colon tissue culture. CONCLUSIONS: For C. difficile negative AAD patients, K. pneumoniae, Candida species and Staphylococcus aureus were found to be potential causative organisms.
TI  - Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the role of Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRPs) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. METHODS: A PCR-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for Qnr-like PRPs in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis in Escherichia coli DH10B. MIC values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and E. coli DH10B harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for PRPs. RESULTS: Amino acid identity of Qnr-like PRPs in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants QnrA1, QnrB1 and QnrS1 was in the range of 16% to 22%. Recombinant plasmids coding for Qnr-like PRPs conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/L for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/L), depending on the antimicrobial agent and PRP. The PRP from B. subtilis showed no protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: The PRPs analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in E. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in quinolone resistance of PRPs from different gram-positive species. These gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for Qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.
TI  - [Relationship between Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea and intestinal microecosystem disorder in patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].
AB  - This study was to investigate the relationship between Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) and intestinal microecosystem in patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and to clarify clinical characteristics of intestinal microecosystem disorder. Clostridium difficile (CD) was isolated and identified by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay using clostridium difficile Premier toxins A&B Kit and anaerobic culture in 44 cases with diarrhea. Fecal flora (bifidobacteria, lactobacillus, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, Clostridium perfringens, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, and yeasts) of patients were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed by Mitsuoka's methods. The results showed that CDAD occurred after using antibiotic or chemotherapy. Clostridium difficile was detected in 12 patients with diarrhea (positive rate was 27.27%). There was marked changes of intestinal microecosystem when patients suffered from CDAD. The number of lactobacillus, bifidobacteria, bacteroides, enterobacteriaceae and so on decreased significantly. It was effective to treat CDAD with vancomycin, metronidazole and probiotic, but the recurrence rate was 16.67%. In conclusion, CDAD complicated by allo-HSCT is related to change of intestinal microecosystem. While treating CDAD with the sensitive antibiotic, the intestinal flora of patients should be supported actively. This treatment contributes to improving disease status and reducing diarrhea recurrence.
TI  - Binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins and their use as molecular Trojan horses for drug delivery into eukaryotic cells.
AB  - Binary bacterial toxins are unique AB-type toxins, composed of two non-linked proteins that act as a binding/translocation component and an enzyme component. All known actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins from clostridia possess this binary structure. This toxin family is comprised of the prototypical Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, Clostridium perfringens iota toxin, Clostridium difficile CDT, and Clostridium spiroforme toxin. Once in the cytosol of host cells, these toxins transfer an ADP-ribose moiety from nicotinamide-adenosine-dinucleotide onto G-actin that then leads to depolymerization of actin filaments. In recent years much progress has been made towards understanding the cellular uptake mechanism of binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins, and in particular that of C2 toxin. Both components act in a precisely concerted manner to intoxicate eukaryotic cells. The binding/translocation (B-) component forms a complex with the enzyme (A-) component and mediates toxin binding to a cell-surface receptor. Following receptor-mediated endocytosis, the enzyme component escapes from acidic endosomes into the cytosol. Acidification of endosomes triggers pore formation by the binding/translocation component in endosomal membranes and the enzyme component subsequently translocates through the pore. This step requires a host cell chaperone, Hsp90. Due to their unique structure, binary toxins are naturally "tailor made" for transporting foreign proteins into the cytosol of host cells. Several highly specific and cell-permeable recombinant fusion proteins have been designed and successfully used in experimental cell research. This review will focus on the recent progress in studying binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins as highly effective virulence factors and innovative tools for cell physiology as well as pharmacology.
TI  - Prevalence of enterotoxin producing Staphylococcus aureus in stools of patients with nosocomial diarrhea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial diarrhea causes prolonged hospital stay leading to additional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures resulting in higher costs. A total of 20%-25% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) cases are attributed to Clostridium difficile. Other microorganisms like Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus are discussed to be associated with AAD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study evaluated the prevalence of enterotoxigenic S. aureus in stool samples submitted to the laboratory with the diagnosis nosocomial diarrhea. A total of 2,727 stools from clinical patients were investigated for S. aureus and C. difficile. Samples were cultured for both bacteria and a C. difficile toxin A and B assay was performed from all stools. Isolated S. aureus were investigated for enterotoxin production and for resistance against methicillin. In addition, both assays were evaluated for determination of S. aureus enterotoxins directly in stool samples. RESULTS: Out of 2,727 stools investigated, 198 grew S. aureus and 148 C. difficile. Toxins A/B from C. difficile were detected in 184 stools. A total of 114 S. aureus strains produced the following enterotoxins in vitro: A, 36; B, 20; C, 19; D, 68; E, 2. Both pathogens were found in 25 stools. Twenty-nine (14.6%) S. aureus strains were identified as methicillin-resistant. The two toxin assays evaluated in this study were not able to detect S. aureus enterotoxins directly in stools. CONCLUSION: The role of enterotoxigenic S. aureus in the pathogenesis of nosocomial and AAD needs further consideration. It might be necessary to investigate stool samples from patients with AAD/nosocomial diarrhea for S. aureus on a routine basis.
TI  - Antibiotic associated diarrhoea: infectious causes.
AB  - Nearly 25% of antibiotic associated diarrhoeas (AAD) is caused by Clostridium difficile, making it the commonest identified and treatable pathogen. Other pathogens implicated infrequently include Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Candida spp. and Salmonella spp. Most mild cases of AAD are due to non-infectious causes which include reduced break down of primary bile acids and decrease metabolism of carbohydrates, allergic or toxic effects of antibiotic on intestinal mucosa and pharmacological effect on gut motility. The antibiotics most frequently associated with C. difficile associated diarrhoea are clindamycin, cephalosporin, ampicillin and amoxicillin. Clinical presentation may vary from mild diarrhoea to severe colitis and pseudomembranous colitis associated with high morbidity and mortality. The most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for C. difficile infection is tissue culture assay for cytotoxicity of toxin B. Commercial ELISA kits are available. Though less sensitive, they are easy to perform and are rapid. Withdrawal of precipitating antibiotic is all that is needed for control of mild to moderate cases. For severe cases of AAD, oral metronidazole is the first line of treatment, and oral vancomycin is the second choice. Probiotics have been used for recurrent cases.
TI  - A novel toxin homologous to large clostridial cytotoxins found in culture supernatant of Clostridium perfringens type C.
AB  - An unknown cytotoxin was identified in the culture supernatant of Clostridium perfringens type C. The cytotoxin, named TpeL, which was purified using mAb-based affinity chromatography, had a lethal activity of 62 minimum lethal dose (MLD) mg(-1) in mice and a cytotoxic activity of 6.2x10(5) cytotoxic units (CU) mg(-1) in Vero cells. The nucleotide sequence of TpeL was determined. The entire ORF had a length of 4953 bases, and the same nucleotide sequence was not recorded in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases. The molecular mass calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence was 191 kDa, and a signal peptide region was not found within the ORF. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited 30-39 % homology to Clostridium difficile toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB), Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) and Clostridium novyi alpha-toxin (TcnA). The amino acid sequence of TpeL is shorter than these toxins, and the homologous region was located at the N-terminal site. Eighteen strains of C. perfringens types A, B and C were surveyed for the presence of the tpeL gene by PCR. The tpeL gene was detected in all type B (one strain) and C strains (five strains), but not in any type A strains (12 strains). TpeL was detected in culture filtrates of the five type C strains by dot-blot analysis, but not in the type B strain. It was concluded that TpeL is a novel toxin similar to the known large clostridial cytotoxins. Furthermore, the data indicated that TpeL is produced by many C. perfringens type C strains.
TI  - In vitro activity against anaerobes of retapamulin, a new topical antibiotic for  treatment of skin infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Retapamulin is the first agent of the pleuromutilin class formulated  as a topical antibacterial for treating skin infections. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of retapamulin by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of this new drug and comparators against a wide range of anaerobic bacteria of human origin. METHODS: The in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by the CLSI reference agar dilution method (M11-A6). RESULTS: Ceftriaxone, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance rates were 54%, 42% and 9.6%, respectively, within the Bacteroides fragilis group. Despite high resistance rates to various antibiotics, retapamulin inhibited 37/52 (71%) strains of the B. fragilis group and 85/87 (98%) of the other Gram-negative bacilli at a concentration of 2 mg/L or less. All the investigated strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 mg/L retapamulin. Three strains of C. difficile and one strain of C. clostridioforme demonstrated decreased susceptibility to retapamulin. Based on inhibitory concentrations, retapamulin was more active than clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone against Propionibacterium acnes and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, as all isolates were inhibited by <or=2 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: At <or=2 mg/L, retapamulin inhibited 90% of all 232 anaerobes tested, whereas overall resistance rates for the comparators were as follows: co-amoxiclav, 2%; metronidazole, 12%; clindamycin, 15% and ceftriaxone, 20%. The broad anaerobic spectrum demonstrated by retapamulin in vitro is attractive. Pending further clinical investigation, retapamulin may offer an alternative treatment for anaerobic skin infections in this era of increasing resistance.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a Polish pilot study into the clinical relevance of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens toxins.
AB  - In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of the Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPEnt) in stool samples originally submitted for detection of Clostridium difficile toxins. Fifty-two fecal samples from inpatients were screened simultaneously for C. difficile and C. perfringens toxins: 75% of the specimens were positive for TcdA/TcdB toxins, 40% were positive for CPEnt, and 31% gave positive test results for both. It is interesting to note that only a relatively small number of C. perfringens isolates were positive for the cpe gene. All C. difficile strains were susceptible to metronidazole, but intermediate metronidazole resistance was documented for the C. perfringens isolates, which decreased upon in vitro passaging in the absence of metronidazole. We recommend that CPEnt detection should be included when diagnosing patients with presumed antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
TI  - Antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide inhibits the pyruvate oxidoreductases of Helicobacter pylori, selected anaerobic bacteria and parasites, and Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Nitazoxanide (NTZ) exhibits broad-spectrum activity against anaerobic bacteria and parasites and the ulcer-causing pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Here we show that NTZ is a noncompetitive inhibitor (K(i), 2 to 10 microM) of the pyruvate:ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductases (PFORs) of Trichomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, H. pylori, and Campylobacter jejuni and is weakly active against the pyruvate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli. To further mechanistic studies, the PFOR operon of H. pylori was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli, and the multisubunit complex was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Pyruvate-dependent PFOR activity with NTZ, as measured by a decrease in absorbance at 418 nm (spectral shift from 418 to 351 nm), unlike the reduction of viologen dyes, did not result in the accumulation of products (acetyl coenzyme A and CO(2)) and pyruvate was not consumed in the reaction. NTZ did not displace the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) cofactor of PFOR, and the 351-nm absorbing form of NTZ was inactive. Optical scans and (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance analyses determined that the spectral shift (A(418) to A(351)) of NTZ was due to protonation of the anion (NTZ(-)) of the 2-amino group of the thiazole ring which could be generated with the pure compound under acidic solutions (pK(a) = 6.18). We propose that NTZ(-) intercepts PFOR at an early step in the formation of the lactyl-TPP transition intermediate, resulting in the reversal of pyruvate binding prior to decarboxylation and in coordination with proton transfer to NTZ. Thus, NTZ might be the first example of an antimicrobial that targets the "activated cofactor" of an enzymatic reaction rather than its substrate or catalytic sites, a novel mechanism that may escape mutation-based drug resistance.
TI  - Nosocomial diarrhoea.
AB  - Toroviruses have been reported as a new cause of nosocomial viral diarrhoea, and  the role of astroviruses has been further elucidated. Polymerase chain reaction methods promise to improve the diagnosis and understanding of the aetiology and control of hospital-acquired viral gastroenteritis. A clearer picture of the impact and extent of Clostridium difficile diarrhoea has emerged, and several control measures have been described. An epidemic Clostridium difficile strain and toxin A-deficient strains have been reported. There is growing evidence that enterotoxin-producing Clostridium perfringens can also cause antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
TI  - Effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  - Tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. However, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. In this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. Fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-O-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. Different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like Clostridium spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as Lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. This indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. Our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. The bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.
TI  - Complementation of a Clostridium perfringens spo0A mutant with wild-type spo0A from other Clostridium species.
AB  - To evaluate whether C. perfringens can be used as a model organism for studying the sporulation process in other clostridia, C. perfringens spo0A mutant IH101 was complemented with wild-type spo0A from four different Clostridium species. Wild-type spo0A from C. acetobutylicum or C. tetani, but not from C. botulinum or C. difficile, restored sporulation and enterotoxin production in IH101. The ability of spo0A from C. botulinum or C. difficile to complement the lack of spore formation in IH101 might be due, at least in part, to the low levels of spo0A transcription and Spo0A production.
TI  - Construction and analysis of chromosomal Clostridium difficile mutants.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is an emerging nosocomial pathogen of increasing importance and virulence but our ability to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of C. difficile-associated disease has been limited because of a lack of tools for its genetic manipulation. We have now developed a reproducible method for the targeted insertional inactivation of chromosomal C. difficile genes. The approach relies on the observation that an Escherichia coli-Clostridium perfringens shuttle vector is unstable in C. difficile and can be used as a form of conditional lethal vector to deliver gene constructs to the chromosome. We have used this methodology to insertionally inactivate two putative response regulator genes, rgaR and rgbR, which encode proteins with similarity to the toxin gene regulator, VirR, from C. perfringens. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the C. difficile RgaR protein positively regulated four genes, including a putative agrBD operon. The RgaR protein was also purified and shown to bind specifically to sites that contained two consensus VirR boxes located just upstream of the putative promoters of these genes. The development of this methodology will significantly enhance our ability to use molecular approaches to develop a greater understanding of the ability of C. difficile to cause disease.
TI  - Comparative analysis of prevalence, risk factors, and molecular epidemiology of antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We prospectively studied the comparative epidemiology and risk factors for Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Four thousand six hundred fifty-nine inpatient fecal specimens (11 months) were tested for C. difficile cytotoxin, C. perfringens enterotoxin, and S. aureus by Vero cell assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and growth on fresh blood agar, respectively. Two distinct age-, sex-, and location-matched control patient groups were used for multivariate logistic regression risk factor analyses: symptomatic patients who were AAD pathogen negative and asymptomatic patients with histories of recent antimicrobial therapy. All AAD pathogen isolates were DNA fingerprinted. In AAD cases, the prevalences of C. difficile cytotoxin, C. perfringens enterotoxin, and S. aureus were 12.7%, 3.3%, and 0.2%, respectively (15.8% overall). Age of >70 years was a common risk factor. Other risk factors for infective AAD and C. difficile AAD included length of hospital stay and use of feeding tubes (length of stay odds ratios [OR], 1.017 and 1.012; feeding tube OR, 1.864 and 2.808). Female gender and use of antacids were significantly associated with increased risk of C. perfringens AAD (OR, 2.08 and 2.789, respectively), but unlike what was found for C. difficile AAD, specific antibiotic classes were not associated with increased risk. A limited number of genotypes caused the majority of C. difficile and C. perfringens AAD cases. Similar to what was found for C. difficile AAD, there was epidemiological evidence of C. perfringens AAD case clustering and reinfection due to different strains. C. difficile AAD was approximately 4 and 60 times more common than C. perfringens AAD and S. aureus AAD, respectively. Risk factors for these AAD pathogens differed, highlighting the need to define specific control measures. There is evidence of nosocomial transmission in cases of C. perfringens AAD.
TI  - In vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, and penicillin against Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Finegoldia magna, and Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Daptomycin has in vitro activity against gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, although limited numbers of species have been tested. We studied the in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, and penicillin against more than 100 strains each of Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Finegoldia magna, and Propionibacterium acnes. Daptomycin Etest MICs and results from time-kill studies were determined for selected strains. For 392 of 421 strains (93%), daptomycin was inhibitory at < or =1 microg/ml, including 15 of 16 strains of C. difficile with elevated linezolid MICs of 8 and 16 microg/ml, all 32 strains with moxifloxacin MICs of > or =4 microg/ml, and all 16 strains resistant to clindamycin. Daptomycin MICs were also < or =1 microg/ml for all 16 F. magna strains resistant to clindamycin and all 32 strains resistant to tetracycline. Only one strain, a C. perfringens strain, had a MIC of >2 microg/ml to daptomycin. Eighty-five and 92.5% of the Etest MICs were within 1 dilution of the agar dilution method for all drugs at 24 and 48 h, respectively. In time-kill studies, a C. difficile strain was inhibited by both daptomycin and vancomycin at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h; colony counts were decreased by 2.3 to 2.9 log at 24 h. Vancomycin was not bactericidal for C. perfringens; however, daptomycin showed bactericidal activity as early as 1 h at four and eight times the MIC and at 2 and 4 h at two and four times the MIC.
TI  - The conjugative transposon Tn5397 has a strong preference for integration into its Clostridium difficile target site.
AB  - Tn5397 is a conjugative transposon, originally isolated from Clostridium difficile. The Tn5397 transposase TndX is related to the phage-encoded serine integrases and the Clostridium perfringens Tn4451 transposase TnpX. TndX is required for the insertion and excision of the transposon. Tn5397 inserts at one locus, attB(Cd), in C. difficile but at multiple sites in Bacillus subtilis. Apart from a conserved 5' GA dinucleotide at the recombination site, there appears to be little sequence conservation between the known target sites. To test the target site preference of Tn5397, attB(Cd) was introduced into the B. subtilis genome. When Tn5397 was transferred into this strain, 100% of the 50 independent transconjugants tested had Tn5397 inserted into attB(Cd). This experiment was repeated using a 50-bp attB(Cd) with no loss of target preference. The mutation of the 5' GA to 5' TC in the attB(Cd) target site caused a switch in the polarity of insertion of Tn5397, which is consistent with this dinucleotide being at the crossover site and in keeping with the mechanism of other serine recombinases. Tn5397 could also transpose into 50-bp sequences encoding the end joints attL and attR but, surprisingly, could not recombine into the circular joint of Tn5397, attTn. Purified TndX was shown to bind specifically to 50-bp attB(Cd), attL, attR, attTn, and attB(Bs)(3) with relative binding affinities attTn approximately attR > attL > attB(Cd) > attB(Bs3). We conclude that TndX has a strong preference for attB(Cd) over other potential recombination sites in the B. subtilis genome and therefore behaves as a site-specific recombinase.
TI  - Organization and regulation of the neurotoxin genes in Clostridium botulinum and  Clostridium tetani.
AB  - Botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins are structurally and functionally related 150 kDa proteins that are potent inhibitors of neuroexocytosis. Botulinum neurotoxin associates with non-toxic proteins to form complexes of various sizes. The botulinum neurotoxin and non-toxic protein genes are clustered in a DNA segment called the botulinum locus. This locus is probably located on a mobile or degenerate mobile element, which accounts for the various genomic localizations (chromosome, plasmid, phage) in different Clostridium botulinum types. The botulinum neurotoxin and non-toxic protein genes are organized in two polycistronic operons (ntnh-bont and ha operons) transcribed in opposite orientations. The gene that separates the two operons of the botulinum locus in C. botulinum A encodes a 21 kDa protein BotR/A, which is a positive regulator of the expression of the botulinum locus genes. Similarly, in Clostridium tetani, the gene located immediately upstream of the tetanus toxin gene, encodes a positive regulatory protein, TetR. BotR and TetR are possibly alternative sigma factors related to TxeR and UviA, which regulate C. difficile toxin and C. perfringens bacteriocin production, respectively. TxeR and UviA define a new sub-group of the sigma(70) family of RNA polymerase initiation factors. In addition, the C. botulinum genome contains predicted two-component system genes, some of which are possibly involved in regulation of toxinogenesis.
TI  - Insights in metabolism and toxin production from the complete genome sequence of  Clostridium tetani.
AB  - The decryption of prokaryotic genome sequences progresses rapidly and provides the scientific community with an enormous amount of information. Clostridial genome sequencing projects have been finished only recently, starting with the genome of the solvent-producing Clostridium acetobutylicum in 2001. A lot of attention has been devoted to the genomes of pathogenic clostridia. In 2002, the genome sequence of C. perfringens, the causative agent of gas gangrene, has been released. Currently in the finishing stage and prior to publication are the genomes of the foodborne botulism-causing C. botulinum and of C. difficile, the causative agent of a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Our team sequenced the genome of neuropathogenic C. tetani, a Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium predominantly found in the soil. In deep wound infections it occasionally causes spastic paralysis in humans and vertebrate animals, known as tetanus disease, by the secretion of potent neurotoxin, designated tetanus toxin. The toxin blocks the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic membranes of interneurons of the spinal cord and the brainstem, thus preventing muscle relaxation. Fortunately, this disease is successfully controlled through immunization with tetanus toxoid, a formaldehyde-treated tetanus toxin, but nevertheless, an estimated 400,000 cases still occur each year, mainly of neonatal tetanus. The World Health Organization has stated that neonatal tetanus is the second leading cause of death from vaccine preventable diseases among children worldwide. This minireview focuses on an analysis of the genome sequence of C. tetani E88, a vaccine production strain, which is a toxigenic non-sporulating variant of strain Massachusetts. The genome consists of a 2,799,250 bp chromosome encoding 2618 open reading frames. The tetanus toxin is encoded on a 74,082 kb plasmid, containing 61 genes. Additional virulence-related factors as well as an insight into the metabolic strategy of C. tetani with regard to its pathogenic phenotype will be presented. The information from other clostridial genomes by means of comparative analysis will also be explored.
TI  - Regulation of toxin and bacteriocin gene expression in Clostridium by interchangeable RNA polymerase sigma factors.
AB  - The production of major extracellular toxins by pathogenic strains of Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium tetani and Clostridium difficile, and a bacteriocin by Clostridium perfringens is dependent on a related group of RNA polymerase sigma-factors. These sigma-factors (BotR, TetR, TcdR and UviA) were shown to be sufficiently similar that they could substitute for one another in in vitro DNA binding and run-off transcription experiments. In cells, however, the sigma-factors fell into two subclasses. BotR and TetR were able to direct transcription of their target genes in a fully reciprocal manner. Similarly, UviA and TcdR were fully interchangeable. Neither BotR nor TetR could substitute for UviA or TcdR, however, and neither UviA nor TcdR could direct transcription of the natural targets of BotR or TetR. The extent of functional interchangeability of the sigma-factors was attributed to the strong conservation of their subregion 4.2 sequences and the conserved -35 sequences of their target promoters, while restrictions on interchangeability were attributed to variations in their subregion 2.4 sequences and the target site -10 sequences. The four sigma-factors have been assigned to group 5 of the sigma(70) family and seem to have arisen from a common ancestral protein that may have co-evolved with the genes whose transcription they direct. A fifth Clostridiumsigma-factor, sigma(Y) of Clostridium acetobutylicum, resembles the TcdR family, but was not functionally interchangeable with members of this family.
TI  - Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens species detected in infant faecal microbiota using 16S rRNA targeted probes.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile are pathogenic clostridia potentially associated with gastrointestinal infections and allergy in infants. To enable the molecular detection and quantification of these species in the infant gut, two 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probes were developed: Cdif198 for C. difficile and Cperf191 for C. perfringens. We defined the probes in silico using the RDP sequence database. The probes were then validated using FISH combined with flow cytometry and a collection of target and non-target strains, and faecal samples inoculated with dilutions of C. difficile and C. perfringens strains. These new probes were used to assess the composition of the intestinal microbiota of 33 infants of 1.5 to 18.5 months of age, associated with a panel of 8 probes targeting the predominant faecal bacterial groups of humans. The probes designed allowed detection and quantification of the relative proportions of C. difficile (0.5+/-1.0%) and C. perfringens (2.1+/-2.3%) in the microbiota of infants.
TI  - Acute diarrhea in the adult horse: case example and review.
AB  
TI  - Clostridial enteric infections in pigs.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens types A and C and Clostridium difficile are the principal enteric clostridial pathogens of swine. History, clinical signs of disease, and gross and microscopic findings form the basis for a presumptive diagnosis of C. perfringens type-C enteritis. Confirmation is based on isolation of large numbers of type-C C. perfringens and/or detection of beta toxin in intestinal contents. Diagnosis of C. perfringens type-A infection, however, remains controversial, mostly because the condition has not been well defined and because type-A organisms and their most important major (alpha) toxin can be found in intestinal contents of healthy and diseased pigs. Isolation of large numbers of C. perfringens type A from intestinal contents, in the absence of other enteric pathogens, is the most reliable criterion on which to base a diagnosis. Recently, beta2 (CPB2) toxin-producing C. perfringens type A has been linked to disease in piglets and other animals. However, implication of CPB2 in pathogenesis of porcine infections is based principally on isolation of C. perfringens carrying cpb2, the gene encoding CPB2, and the specific role of CPB2 in enteric disease of pigs remains to be fully defined. Clostridium difficile can also be a normal inhabitant of the intestine of healthy pigs, and diagnosis of enteric infection with this microorganism is based on detection of its toxins in feces or intestinal contents.
TI  - Regulation of toxin and bacteriocin synthesis in Clostridium species by a new subgroup of RNA polymerase sigma-factors.
AB  - Many Clostridium species are pathogenic for humans and animals, and most of the resulting diseases, such as tetanus, botulism, gas gangrene and pseudomembranous colitis, are due to the production of potent extracellular toxins. The biochemical mechanisms of action of Clostridium toxins have been extensively studied in the past ten years. However, detailed information about the regulation of toxin gene expression has only recently emerged. TcdR, BotR, TetR and UviA are now known to be related alternative RNA polymerase sigma factors that drive transcription of toxin A and toxin B genes in C. difficile, the neurotoxin genes in C. botulinum and C. tetani, and a bacteriocin gene in C. perfringens. Although the Clostridium sigma factors have some similarity to members of the ECF sigma factor group, they differ sufficiently in structure and function so that they have been assigned to a new group within the sigma(70)-family.
TI  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea: an overlooked aetiology?
AB  - Sixty-three faeces samples from hospital in-patients with probable antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) are investigated. All samples are examined for routine bacterial enteric pathogens, pus cells, red blood cells and parasites. The samples are also screened for Clostridium difficile cytotoxin B (CDT), C. perfringens enterotoxin and Candida spp. (by microscopy and quantitative culture). Faecal samples from two control groups (healthy volunteers and community samples from GP patients) are also screened. A possible pathogen was found in 71% of AAD cases. Candida spp. overgrowth was the most common (44.4%), followed by CDT (34.9%) and Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (9.5%). There was good agreement between the significant Gram films and quantitative Candida spp. culture (kappa=0.683). Clinical information revealed the majority of patients were on multiple antibiotic regimes, receiving 'high risk' antibiotics. Of community samples, 21% were positive for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, indicating that C. perfringens is a problem in the community, not necessarily associated with antibiotic use. The results suggest that quantitative Candida spp. culture should be performed on all specimens requesting AAD investigations.
TI  - Diarrhea in American infants and young children in the community setting: incidence, clinical presentation and microbiology.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The characteristics and microbiology of the full spectrum of pediatric diarrhea occurring in the U.S. community setting are not well-understood. METHODS: Six-month prospective cohort study of 604 healthy 6- to 36-month-old children recruited by the Slone Center Office-based Research Network. RESULTS: The incidence of parent-defined diarrhea was 2.2 episodes per person-year. The median duration of diarrhea was 2 days with a median of 6 stools per episode. Outpatient visits and hospitalization were prompted by 9.7 and 0.3% of episodes, respectively. The most common microorganisms identified in healthy baseline stools were atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (12.2%), enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (3.7%), Clostridium difficile (3.5%) and Clostridium perfringens (2.9%), and each of these was no more common in diarrhea stools. In contrast, all of the viruses analyzed were more prevalent in diarrhea specimens than in baseline specimens: enteric adenovirus (5.7% diarrhea versus 1.4% baseline), rotavirus (5.2% versus 1.4%), astrovirus (3.5% versus 1.4%), Sapporo-like virus (3.0% versus 0.8%) and norovirus (1.9% versus 0.8%). A likely pathogen was detected in 20.6% of diarrhea specimens. Vomiting and > or =16 stools in an episode were predictive of isolating a pathogen from the stool, each with a relative risk of approximately 2. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy young children in this study experienced more than 2 cases of diarrhea per person-year, but most were brief and do not require medical attention. Although most diarrhea-associated pathogens were viruses, no likely pathogen was found in almost 80% of cases; possible etiologies for these cases include currently unknown gastrointestinal infections, nongastrointestinal illnesses and dietary/environmental factors.
TI  - Detection and quantification of four species of the genus Clostridium in infant feces.
AB  - To determine the composition of Clostridium in the feces of infants approximately 30 days old, we have developed a detection and quantification method of Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tertium, and Clostridium difficile by species-specific primers. C. perfringens and C. difficile were detected in four fecal samples from 22 infants (18.2%), whereas C. paraputrificum was detected in three samples (16.7%). C. tertium was detected in two samples (9.1%). Moreover, the occurrences of the four species in bottle-and mix-fed infants were relatively higher than in breast-fed infants (P< 0.05). Subsequently, positive samples detected by nested PCR (polymerase chain reaction) were subjected to realtime PCR. The results showed that the numbers of C. paraputrificum, C. perfringens, C. tertium, and C. difficile ranged from about 1x10(5) to 3x10(7) cells/g wet feces.
TI  - Prevalence of Clostridium difficile toxins A and B and Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A in stool samples of patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a major nosocomial as well as a community health problem. Clostridium difficile toxins (CDT) can be detected in only 10-25% of patients with AAD. The role of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A (CPEnt) as a cause of AAD remains to be elucidated. We, therefore, prospectively investigated the prevalences of both CPEnt and CDT in stool samples of patients with AAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 693 stool samples consecutively submitted to our department from patients with AAD were screened for CDT and CPEnt using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA). C. difficile and C. perfringens were detected by standard culture techniques. In addition, samples being CPEnt positive and/ or harboring C. perfringens were screened for the CPEnt gene by duplex PCR. RESULTS: CDT was detected in 79 (11.4%) of 693 stool samples. Of these, 49 (62.0%) harbored C. difficile. In one (0.14%) of 693 samples, CPEnt could be detected by ELISA. This respective CPEnt-positive stool sample also harbored C. perfringens. 147 (21.2%) of all stool samples were culture positive for C. perfringens. We did not detect samples positive for both CPEnt and CDT. In five (3.4%) of 147 C. perfringens isolates, the CPEnt gene could be detected by duplex PCR. PCR was positive in two (40%) of the five stool samples harboring CPEnt gene-positive C. perfringens isolates. CONCLUSION: The present prospective study revealed a prevalence of CDT of 11.4%, whereas the prevalence of CPEnt was less than 1%. Routine screening of stool samples for CPEnt does not appear to be justified in patients with AAD.
TI  - Evidence for clostridial implication in necrotizing enterocolitis through bacterial fermentation in a gnotobiotic quail model.
AB  - Despite extensive research, the pathogenesis of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains elusive. The aim of our work was to investigate the role of bacterial strains involved in NEC in gnotobiotic quails as experimental model. Six groups of germ-free quails that were fed a lactose diet were associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, C. paraputrificum, or C. butyricum (two strains). Implantation level, incidence of cecal lesions, production of short-chain fatty acids, and histologic lesions of the cecal wall were investigated. Whatever the strain, the implantation level was high (10(9) UFC/g). Neither K. pneumoniae nor C. difficile induced any cecal lesions. In contrast, the four other clostridial strains led to cecal NEC-like lesions with a variable occurrence: four of 12 quails for C. perfringens, eight of 12 quails for C. paraputrificum, and the same highest value, nine of 12 quails and eight of 10 quails for both C. butyricum strains. Gross aspects of the lesions may be linked to the short-chain fatty acid profiles and/or concentrations: thickening of the cecal wall (C. butyricum and C. perfringens) with high proportion of butyric acid, hemorrhages (C. paraputrificum) with high proportion of iso-butyric acid, and presence of other iso-acids. In addition, C. butyricum was characterized by pneumatosis, linked to a high gas production. Microscopic aspects confirmed the presence of edemas and intramucosa hemorrhages. Clostridia species, whose role is controversial, seem to be strongly implicated in NEC through excessive production of butyric acid as a result of colonic lactose fermentation. These results call for anaerobe detection in feces of infants who have NEC.
TI  - Genomics of clostridial pathogens: implication of extrachromosomal elements in pathogenicity.
AB  - The recently decoded genomes of the major clostridial toxin-producing pathogens Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium difficile have provided a huge amount of new sequence data. Recent studies have focused on the identification and investigation of pathogenic determinants and the regulatory events governing their expression. The sequence data revealed also the genomic background of virulence genes, as well as the contribution of extrachromosomal elements to a pathogenic phenotype. This has generated new insights in clostridial pathogenesis - and will continue to do so in the future - and has deepened our understanding of the anaerobic lifestyle of clostridial species.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens type A & antibiotic associated diarrhoea.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Clostridium perfringens type A (CPA) isolates produce lethal necrotizing antigens and the heat resistant forms of the organism are associated with pathogenic outcome in humans. CPA has also been implicated in antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD). We therefore undertook this study to investigate the presence of CPA in stool samples of patients with AAD in a tertiary care setting in north India. METHODS: A total of 285 stool samples obtained from patients suspected for Clostridium difficile aetiology were examined for the presence of CPA antigens. Four sets of reagents (CP-I, CP-II, CP-III and CP- IV) comprising latex beads coated with polyvalent immune sera to 17 serotypes of heat resistant CPA were used in the study. Agglutination reaction was carried out using the reagents with the stool supernatants. RESULTS: Of the 285 stool samples tested, 25 (8.77%) were positive for at least one or more of the four polyvalent sets. Briefly, 48 per cent were positive for all the four sets, 12 per cent for 3 sets, 28 per cent for 2 sets and 12 per cent for only one set, indicating the prevalence of multiple serotypes of CPA. Twenty three (92%) of the 25 positive samples came from patients who were on antibiotics. C. difficile toxin was also present in 9 of 25 (36%) of the samples positive for CPA antigens. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: In our setting, CPA could thus be associated with AAD either by itself or in synergy with C. difficile infection. Assessment of true burden of CPA associated AAD would be required to take appropriate steps for its control in our country.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium perfringens by a novel strain of Bacillus subtilis isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to isolate beneficial strains of microorganisms from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens and to screen them against Clostridium perfringens, a causative agent of necrotic enteritis in poultry. One of the bacteria isolated, a strain of Bacillus subtilis, was found to possess an anticlostridial factor that could inhibit the C. perfringens ATCC 13124 used in this study. The anticlostridial factor produced by B. subtilis PB6 was found to be fully or partially inactivated in the presence of pronase, trypsin, and pepsin. In contrast, the antimicrobial activity of the anticlostridial factor was not affected by treatment at 100 or 121 degrees C or by treatment with any of the organic solvents used in the study. The optimum growth temperature and optimum pH for production of the anticlostridial factor were 37 degrees C and 6.20, respectively. Using the mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy technique, the apparent molecular mass of the anticlostridial factor was estimated to be in the range from 960 to 983 Da. In terms of the antimicrobial spectrum, the anticlostridial factor was inhibitory toward various strains of C. perfringens implicated in necrotic enteritis in poultry, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of commercial canine and feline raw diets.
AB  - Twenty-five commercial raw diets for dogs and cats were evaluated bacteriologically. Coliforms were present in all diets, ranging from 3.5 x 10(3) to 9.4 x 10(6) CFU/g (mean 8.9 x 10(5); standard deviation 1.9 x 10(6)). Escherichia coli was identified in 15/25 (64%) diets; however, E. coli O157 was not detected. Salmonella spp. were detected in 5/25 (20%) diets; 1 each of beef-, lamb-, quail-, chicken-, and ostrich-based diets. Sporeforming bacteria were identified from 4/25 (16%) samples on direct culture and 25/25 (100%) samples using enrichment culture. Clostridium perfringens was identified in 5/25 (20%) samples. A toxigenic strain of C. difficile was isolated from one turkey-based food. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 1/25 (4%) diets. Campylobacter spp. were not isolated from any of the diets.
TI  - Tylosin-responsive chronic diarrhea in dogs.
AB  - Fourteen dogs had shown chronic or intermittent diarrhea for more than 1 year. Diarrhea had been successfully treated with tylosin for at least 6 months but recurred when treatment was withdrawn on at least 2 occasions. Tylosin-responsive diarrhea (TRD) affects typically middle-aged, large-breed dogs and clinical signs indicate that TRD affects both the small and large intestine. Treatment with tylosin eliminated diarrhea in all dogs within 3 days and in most dogs within 24 hours. Tylosin administration controlled diarrhea in all dogs, but after it was discontinued, diarrhea reappeared in 12 (85.7%) of 14 dogs within 30 days. Prednisone given for 3 days did not completely resolve diarrhea. Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG did not prevent the relapse of diarrhea in any of 9 dogs so treated. The etiology of TRD, a likely form of antibiotic-responsive diarrhea (ARD) is unclear. The following reasons for chronic diarrhea were excluded or found to be unlikely: parasites, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, enteropathogenic bacteria (Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Yersinia spp., or Lawsoni intracellularis), and Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and Clostridium difficile A toxin. A possible etiologic factor is a specific enteropathogenic organism that is a common resident in the canine gastrointestinal tract and is sensitive to tylosin but difficult to eradicate. Additional studies are required to identify the specific cause of TRD.
TI  - Transcription activation of a UV-inducible Clostridium perfringens bacteriocin gene by a novel sigma factor.
AB  - Expression of the plasmid-encoded Clostridium perfringens gene for bacteriocin BCN5 was shown to depend in vivo and in vitro on the activity of UviA protein. UviA, also plasmid-encoded, proved to be an RNA polymerase sigma factor and was also partly autoregulatory. The uviA gene has two promoters; one provided a UviA-independent, basal level of gene expression while the stronger, UviA-dependent promoter was only utilized after the cell experienced DNA damage. As a result, BCN5 synthesis is induced by treatment with UV light or mitomycin C. UviA is related to a special class of sigma factors found to date only in Clostridium species and responsible for activating transcription of toxin genes in Clostridium difficile, Clostridium tetani, and Clostridium botulinum.
TI  - Strains and toxins of Clostridium.
AB  
TI  - Clinical features of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea due to binary toxin (actin-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase)-producing strains.
AB  - Toxins A and B are known to be the primary virulence factors of Clostridium difficile. Other potential virulence factors have been identified such as binary toxin (actin-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin, or CDT). A retrospective case-control study was performed in order to identify clinical features and risk factors of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea due to binary toxin-producing strains. Each case (a patient with diarrhoea due to binary toxin-producing strain) was compared with two controls (patients with diarrhoea due to a C. difficile strain that did not produce binary toxin) matched for ward and date of hospitalization. cdtA and cdtB genes were screened by PCR. Production of CDT was studied by Western blotting using an antiserum against Ia and Ib from the Clostridium perfringens iota toxin, and the activity of the binary toxin was assessed using an ADP-ribosyltransferase assay. Twenty-six cases (14 males and 12 females) were identified in 1999 and 2000. Cases and controls did not differ significantly for sex, age, previous administration of antibiotics or frequency of endoscopic examination. Diarrhoea was community-acquired more often in cases than in controls (65.4 vs 35.7 %, P = 0.017) and more often represented the cause of hospitalization (61.5 vs 26.2 %, P = 0.003). Moreover, diarrhoea in cases was more frequently associated with abdominal pain (63.6 vs 39.4 %, P = 0.07) and with liquid stools (76.9 vs 59.5 %, P = 0.14) than in controls. These results suggest that there could be a correlation between the production of binary toxin and the severity of diarrhoea.
TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of bacteria and host factors in an outbreak situation of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) represents a clinical entity leading to prolonged hospital stays and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and results in additional costs. The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence and characteristics of different bacteria in stools of patients with AAD. The reliability of diagnostic procedures under routine conditions was evaluated. Host factors were also analysed. From June 2002 to April 2003 89 cases of diarrhoea were reported at a hospital unit for internal medicine. Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens toxin enzyme-immunoassays (EIAs), and culture for C. difficile, C. perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus were performed on stool samples from all patients. Toxin production was determined in isolated S. aureus strains. In vitro susceptibility of S. aureus for oxacillin and of C. difficile for vancomycin, metronidazole, linezolid, fusidic acid and tetracycline was tested. Host factors, such as age, comorbidities, antibiotic exposure and contact with other patients, were evaluated. Twenty-six stools were positive for C. difficile toxins by an EIA technique, while C. difficile was cultured from 39. C. difficile was isolated from 21 stools that were EIA negative. Additionally, from 28 stools S. aureus and/or C. perfringens could be isolated. Nine samples contained only S. aureus and/or C. perfringens. Thirty-one stools were negative in all tests. All C. difficile isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and metronidazole. Age >60 years, and diseases of the vascular system, the heart, the kidneys and the lungs were identified as risk factors for acquiring C. difficile in this setting (P values < 0.05). Stool culture for C. difficile was shown to be more sensitive than toxin EIA in this study. Risk factors for the acquisition of C. difficile in outbreak situations seem to differ from risk factors in the normal hospital setting. The role of toxin-producing S. aureus in cases of AAD needs further investigation.
TI  - Quorum sensing in Clostridium difficile: analysis of a luxS-type signalling system.
AB  - The increasing incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated disease, and the problems associated with its control, highlight the need for additional countermeasures. The attenuation of virulence through the blockade of bacterial cell-to-cell communication (quorum sensing) is one potential therapeutic target. Preliminary studies have shown that C. difficile produces at least one potential signalling molecule. Through the molecule's ability to induce bioluminescence in a Vibrio harveyi luxS reporter strain, it has been shown to correspond to autoinducer 2 (AI-2). In keeping with this observation, a homologue of luxS has been identified in the genome of C. difficile. Adjacent to luxS(Cd) a potential transcriptional regulator and sensor kinase, rolA and rolB, have been located. RT-PCR has been used to confirm the genetic organization of the luxS(Cd) locus. While AI-2 production has not been blocked so far using antisense technology, AI-2 levels could be modulated by controlling expression of the putative transcriptional regulator rolA. RolA, therefore, acts as a negative regulator of AI-2 production. Finally, it has been shown that the exogenous addition of AI-2 or 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H) furanone has no discernible effect on the production of toxins by C. difficile.
TI  - BotR/A and TetR are alternative RNA polymerase sigma factors controlling the expression of the neurotoxin and associated protein genes in Clostridium botulinum type A and Clostridium tetani.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium tetani, respectively, produce potent toxins, botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and tetanus neurotoxin (TeTx), which are responsible for severe diseases, botulism and tetanus. Neurotoxin synthesis is a regulated process in Clostridium. The genes botR/A in C. botulinum A and tetR in C. tetani positively regulate expression of BoNT/A and associated non-toxic proteins (ANTPs), as well as TeTx respectively. The botR/A gene lies in close vicinity of the two operons which contain bont/A and antps genes in C. botulinum A, and tetR immediately precedes the tetX gene in C. tetani. We show that BotR/A and TetR function as specific alternative sigma factors rather than positive regulators based on the following results: (i) BotR/A and TetR associated with target DNAs only in the presence of the RNA polymerase core enzyme (Core), (ii) BotR/A and TetR directly bound with the core enzyme, (iii) BotR/A-Core recognized -35 and -10 regions of ntnh-bont/A promoter and (iv) BotR/A and TetR triggered in vitro transcription from the target promoters. In C. botulinum A, bont/A and antps genes are transcribed as bi- and tricistronic operons controlled by BotR/A. BotR/A and TetR are seemingly related to a new subgroup of the sigma70 family that includes TcdR and UviA, which, respectively, regulate production of toxins A and B in C. difficile and bacteriocin in C. perfringens. Sequences of -35 region are highly conserved in the promoter of target toxin genes in C. botulinum, C. tetani, C. difficile and C. perfringens. Overall, a common regulation mechanism probably controls toxin gene expression in these four toxigenic clostridial species.
TI  - CdeA of Clostridium difficile, a new multidrug efflux transporter of the MATE family.
AB  - The cdeA gene, cloned from Clostridium difficile clinical strain 714 under the control of its natural promoter made Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens resistant to ethidium bromide and acriflavin but had no effect on the susceptibility of the hosts to the following antibiotics: norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, erythromycin, tetracyclin, and chloramphenicol. However, it was responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli when it was cloned under the control of the Plac promoter. Quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR showed that growth of C. difficile clinical strain 253 in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of ethidium bromide significantly increased the transcription of cdeA, but this was not observed with ciprofloxacin. The deduced protein was homologous to the protein sequences of known efflux pumps from the third cluster (the so-called DinF branch) of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family. CdeA caused ethidium bromide energy-dependent efflux in whole cells of E. coli. Efflux activity was stimulated by addition of Na+ ions, suggesting that CdeA, like other pumps of the MATE family, is a Na+-coupled efflux pump. CdeA is the first multidrug efflux transporter identified in C. difficile.

TI  - Binary bacterial toxins: biochemistry, biology, and applications of common Clostridium and Bacillus proteins.
AB  - Certain pathogenic species of Bacillus and Clostridium have developed unique methods for intoxicating cells that employ the classic enzymatic "A-B" paradigm for protein toxins. The binary toxins produced by B. anthracis, B. cereus, C. botulinum, C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. spiroforme consist of components not physically associated in solution that are linked to various diseases in humans, animals, or insects. The "B" components are synthesized as precursors that are subsequently activated by serine-type proteases on the targeted cell surface and/or in solution. Following release of a 20-kDa N-terminal peptide, the activated "B" components form homoheptameric rings that subsequently dock with an "A" component(s) on the cell surface. By following an acidified endosomal route and translocation into the cytosol, "A" molecules disable a cell (and host organism) via disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, increasing intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, or inactivation of signaling pathways linked to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases. Recently, B. anthracis has gleaned much notoriety as a biowarfare/bioterrorism agent, and of primary interest has been the edema and lethal toxins, their role in anthrax, as well as the development of efficacious vaccines and therapeutics targeting these virulence factors and ultimately B. anthracis. This review comprehensively surveys the literature and discusses the similarities, as well as distinct differences, between each Clostridium and Bacillus binary toxin in terms of their biochemistry, biology, genetics, structure, and applications in science and medicine. The information may foster future studies that aid novel vaccine and drug development, as well as a better understanding of a conserved intoxication process utilized by various gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria.
TI  - Intestinal microecology and quality of life in irritable bowel syndrome patients.
AB  - AIM: It has been noticed that gastroenteritis or dysentery plays a role in pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and antibiotics can increase functional abdominal symptoms, both of which may be partly due to intestinal flora disorders. This study was to determine the change of gut flora of IBS, a cluster of abdominal symptoms. Because of the chronic course and frequent occurrence of the disease, IBS patients suffered much from it. So the quality of life (Qol) of IBS patients was also evaluated in this study. METHODS: Twenty-five Rome II criteria-positive IBS patients were recruited, and 25 age and gender-matched healthy volunteers were accepted as control. The fecal flora, including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, C. perfringens Enterobacteriacea and Enterococus, were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. We also calculated the ratio of Bifidobacterium to Enterobacteriaceae (B/E ratio) in both IBS patients and controls. In both groups, the data were further analyzed based on age difference, and comparisons were made between the younger and elder subgroups. We also evaluated the quality of life (QoL) of IBS patients and the control group using the Chinese version of SF-36 health questionnaire. RESULTS: In IBS patients, the number of fecal Bifidobacterium was significantly decreased and that of Enterobacteriaceae was significantly increased compared with that in healthy controls (both P<0.05). The mean microbial colonization resistance (CR) of the bowel in IBS patients was smaller than 1, making a significant difference compared with that in control which was more than 1 (P<0.01). There was no significant difference in gut flora between two subgroups. While in control, the elder subgroup presented more Enterobacteriacea than the younger one (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, IBS patients had significantly lower scores on all SF-36 scales, with the exception of physical functioning. However, there was no significant correlation between quality of life and enteric symptoms in IBS patients. CONCLUSION: There are intestinal flora disorders in IBS patients, which may be involved in triggering the IBS-like symptoms. IBS patients experience significant impairment in QoL, however, the impairment is not caused directly by enteric symptoms.
TI  - Screening of the equine intestinal microflora for potential probiotic organisms.
AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Probiotics have not been demonstrated to provide any beneficial health effects in horses, possibly because of improper selection of probiotic organisms. This study was designed to identify lactic acid bacteria of equine origin with predetermined beneficial properties which might make them useful as therapeutic probiotics. HYPOTHESIS: A small percentage of lactic acid bacteria that are native to the intestinal tract of horses possess properties that may be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of gastrointestinal disease in horses. METHODS: Faecal samples were collected from healthy mature horses and foals. Lactic acid bacteria were isolated and tested for the ability to grow in acid and bile environments, aerotolerance and in vitro inhibition of enteropathogens. One isolate that possessed these properties was administered orally to healthy mature horses and foals and gastrointestinal survival was assessed. RESULTS: Of the 47 tested organisms, 18 were deemed to be adequately acid- and bile-tolerant. All were aerotolerant. Four organisms markedly inhibited Salmonella spp. One isolate, Lactobacillus pentosus WE7, was subjectively superior and chosen for further study. It was also inhibitory against E. coli, moderately inhibitory against S. zooepidemicus and C. difficile and mildly inhibitory against C. perfringens. After oral administration, this isolate was recovered from the faeces of 8/9 (89%) foals and 7/8 (87.5%) mature horses. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus pentosus WE7 possesses in vitro and in vivo properties that may be useful for the prevention and treatment of enteric disease in horses. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: The beneficial in vitro and in vivo properties that L. pentosus WE7 possesses indicate that randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled efficacy studies are warranted.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of a binary toxin (actin-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase) from Clostridium difficile.
AB  - In addition to the two large clostridial cytotoxins (TcdA and TcdB), some strains of Clostridium difficile also produce an actin-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase, called binary toxin CDT. We used a PCR method and Southern blotting for the detection of genes encoding the enzymatic (CDTa) and binding (CDTb) components of the binary toxin in 369 strains isolated from patients with suspected C. difficile-associated diarrhea or colitis. Twenty-two strains (a prevalence of 6%) harbored both genes. When binary toxin production was assessed by Western blotting, 19 of the 22 strains reacted with antisera against the iota toxin of C. perfringens (anti-Ia and anti-Ib). Additionally, binary toxin activity, detected by the ADP-ribosyltransferase assay, was present in only 17 of the 22 strains. Subsequently, all 22 binary toxin-positive strains were tested for the production of toxins TcdA and TcdB, toxinotyped, and characterized by serogrouping, PCR ribotyping, arbitrarily primed PCR, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All binary toxin-positive strains also produced TcdB and/or TcdA. However, they had significant changes in the tcdA and tcdB genes and belonged to variant toxinotypes III, IV, V, VII, IX, and XIII. We could differentiate 16 profiles by using typing methods, indicating that most of the binary toxin-positive strains were unrelated.
TI  - Microbial-gut interactions in health and disease. Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  - Most cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) are directly or indirectly due to the alteration of gut microflora by antibiotics. 'Functional' diarrhoea, usually limited to a mild and brief change in stool frequency, is considered as the most frequent pattern of AAD. Reduced carbohydrate fermentation and impaired metabolism of bile acids have been claimed as the potential causes of this transient digestive discomfort but a critical analysis of the data supporting these theories is necessary. Alternatively, changes in the gut flora ecosystem allow pathogens to proliferate. Clostridium difficile is responsible for approximately 10% of cases of AAD and almost all cases of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. The level of evidence which supports the potential responsibility of other candidate pathogens (Klebsiella oxytoca, enterotoxin-producing Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus, Candida) needs to be appreciated according to the updated postulates of causality relationships between a bacterium and a disease.
TI  - The host cell chaperone Hsp90 is necessary for cytotoxic action of the binary iota-like toxins.
AB  - The heat shock protein Hsp90 is essential for uptake of the binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins Clostridium perfringens iota-toxin and Clostridium difficile transferase into eukaryotic cells. Inhibition of Hsp90 by its specific inhibitor radicicol delayed intoxication of Vero cells by these toxins. A common Hsp90-dependent mechanism for their translocation is discussed.
TI  - The large resolvase TnpX is the only transposon-encoded protein required for transposition of the Tn4451/3 family of integrative mobilizable elements.
AB  - Chloramphenicol resistance in Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile is often encoded by catP genes located within the 6.3 kb integrative mobilizable elements Tn4451 and Tn4453 respectively. This family of transposons is capable of being mobilized into a recipient cell in the presence of another conjugative element. Transposition is mediated by the large resolvase TnpX, which excises the element to produce a circular molecule that is the integrative intermediate. In this study, in vivo deletion analysis of the transposon-encoded tnpV and tnpY genes showed that they are not essential for excision or integration of this group of elements. Similar studies on tnpW suggested either that this gene is not essential for these functions or that TnpW does not function when provided in trans. Development and use of an in vivo insertion assay showed that TnpX is the only transposon-encoded protein required for the integration reaction. Subsequently, a TnpXLEH6 protein was purified and shown to catalyse excision in vitro in the absence of any other protein and preferentially to excise a supercoiled DNA substrate. In summary, these studies have shown that TnpX is the only transposon protein required in vivo and in vitro for the excision process and that, like excision, integration also occurs by a serine recombinase-mediated site-specific recombination mechanism.
TI  - The role of bacterial and non-bacterial toxins in the induction of changes in membrane transport: implications for diarrhea.
AB  - Bacterial toxins induce changes in membrane transport which underlie the loss of  electrolyte homeostasis associated with diarrhea. Bacterial- and their secreted toxin-types which have been linked with diarrhea include: (a) Vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin, E1 Tor hemolysin and accessory cholera enterotoxin); (b) Escherichia coli (heat stable enterotoxin, heat-labile enterotoxin and colicins); (c) Shigella dysenteriae (shiga-toxin); (d) Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens enterotoxin, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin and theta-toxin); (e) Clostridium difficile (toxins A and B); (f) Staphylococcus aureus (alpha-haemolysin); (g) Bacillus cereus (cytotoxin K and haemolysin BL); and (h) Aeromonas hydrophila (aerolysin, heat labile cytotoxins and heat stable cytotoxins). The mechanisms of toxin-induced diarrhea include: (a) direct effects on ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, i.e. direct toxin interaction with intrinsic ion channels in the membrane and (b) indirect interaction with ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells mediated by toxin binding to a membrane receptor. These effects consequently cause the release of second messengers, e.g. the release of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate/guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, IP(3), Ca2+ and/or changes in second messengers that are the result of toxin-formed Ca2+ and K+ permeable channels, which increase Ca2+ flux and augment changes in Ca2+ homeostasis and cause depolarisation of the membrane potential. Consequently, many voltage-dependent ion transport systems, e.g. voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, are affected. The toxin-formed ion channels may act as a pathway for loss of fluid and electrolytes. Although most of the diarrhea-causing toxins have been reported to act via cation and anion channel formation, the properties of these channels have not been well studied, and the available biophysical properties that are needed for the characterization of these channels are inadequate.
TI  - Evaluation of in vitro properties of di-tri-octahedral smectite on clostridial toxins and growth.
AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Clostridial colitis and endotoxaemia of intestinal  origin are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in horses. Intestinal adsorbents are available for treatment of these conditions; however, little information exists supporting their use. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the ability of di-tri-octahedral smectite to bind to Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, C. perfringens enterotoxin and endotoxin, inhibit clostridial growth and the actions of metronidazole in vitro. METHODS: Clostridium difficile toxins, C. perfringens enterotoxin and endotoxin were mixed with serial dilutions of di-tri-octahedral smectite, then tested for the presence of clostridial toxins or endotoxin using commercial tests. Serial dilutions of smectite were tested for the ability to inhibit growth of C. perfringens in culture broth, and to interfere with the effect of metronidazole on growth of C. perfringens in culture broth. RESULTS: Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, and C. perfringens enterotoxin were completely bound at dilutions of 1:2 to 1:16. Partial binding of C. difficile toxins occurred at dilutions up to 1:256 while partial binding of C. perfringens enterotoxin occurred up to a dilution of 1:128. Greater than 99% binding of endotoxin occurred with dilutions 1:2 to 1:32. No inhibition of growth of C. difficile or C. perfringens was present at any dilution, and there was no effect on the action of metronidazole. CONCLUSIONS: Di-tri-octahedral smectite possesses the ability to bind C. difficile toxins A and B, C. perfringens enterotoxin and endotoxin in vivo while having no effect on bacterial growth or the action of metronidazole. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: In vivo studies are required to determine whether di-tri-octahedral smectite might be a useful adjunctive treatment of clostridial colitis and endotoxaemia in horses.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - Bacterial-associated diarrhea in the dog: a critical appraisal.
AB  - The clinical documentation of enteropathogenic bacteria causing diarrhea in dogs  is clouded by the presence of many of these organisms existing as normal constituents of the indigenous intestinal flora. The diagnosis of a putative bacterial enteropathogen(s) in dogs should be made based on a combination of parameters, including signalment and predisposing factors, clinical signs, serologic assays for toxins, fecal culture, and PCR. Relying on results of fecal culture alone is problematic, because C perfringens, C difficile, Campylobacter spp, and pathogenic and non-pathogenic E coli are commonly isolated from apparently healthy dogs [10,13,33]. Nevertheless, culture may be useful in procuring isolates for the application of molecular techniques, such as PCR, for detection of specific toxin genes or molecular typing of isolated strains to establish clonality in suspected outbreaks. The oversimplistic attempt to characterize bacterially associated diarrhea by anatomic localization of clinical signs should be discouraged, because most of the previously mentioned bacteria have been associated with small and large intestinal diarrhea. Accurate diagnosis of infections may require diagnostic laboratories to incorporate PCR-based assays using genus- and species-specific primers to facilitate detection of toxin genes and differentiation of species that appear phenotypically and biochemically similar. There has been tremendous interest in the application of microarray technology for the simultaneous detection of thousands of genes or target DNA sequences on one glass slide. This powerful tool could be used for detection of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in fecal specimens obtained from dogs in the future.
TI  - Construction of a fusion protein carrying antigenic determinants of enteric clostridial toxins.
AB  - Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens type A are infectious agents of enteric diseases. The main virulence factors of these microorganisms include toxins A and B of C. difficile (ToxA and ToxB) and enterotoxin of C. perfringens (Cpe). In this study genetic constructions have been created for the expression of ToxA, ToxB and Cpe fragments either as individual components or as a hybrid multidomain (ToxA-ToxB-Cpe) protein. Rabbit monospecific sera raised against individual peptides reacted with the chimeric product indicating that the corresponding antigenic determinants were correctly expressed on the hybrid molecule. Furthermore, mice immunized with the fusion protein produced antibodies specific to each of the three separate components. These data suggest that the constructed three-domain molecule could be used in future studies for development of a vaccine against enteric clostridial diseases.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of SMAP-29 against the Bacteroides fragilis group and clostridia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The cathelicidin-derived peptide SMAP-29 exerts rapid and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against aerobic bacteria and fungi. In this study, the effects of the peptide against the Bacteroides fragilis group, including antibiotic-resistant isolates, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile reference and clinical isolates, were investigated. METHODS: The microbicidal activity of SMAP-29 against eight reference and 100 clinical anaerobic strains from a national collection was assessed using a microdilution susceptibility assay, and by determining the killing kinetics on selected strains. The killing mechanism was investigated further by means of a two-colour fluorescent permeabilization assay, and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: The Bacteroides fragilis group, Clostridium reference strains and most clinical isolates were inhibited in vitro by 1-2 microM (3.2-6.4 mg/L) SMAP-29, and killed by 1.5- to 2-fold higher peptide concentrations. The anaerobic bacterial cells were 90%-100% permeabilized within 2 h of exposure to bactericidal concentrations of the peptide. The SEM images of bacteria exposed to SMAP-29 provide morphological evidence that the envelope is an important target of the bactericidal activity of this peptide. These results are consistent with earlier studies indicating that SMAP-29 kills aerobic bacteria with a membranolytic mechanism, and suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria share surface features that are targeted by this peptide. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that the spectrum of antibacterial activity of SMAP-29 includes the B. fragilis group and Clostridium species, and encourage further investigations of the therapeutic potential of this peptide.
TI  - Detection of Clostridium difficile cytotoxin and Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin in cases of diarrhoea in the community.
AB  - Faecal specimens from 843 cases of diarrhoea in the community were tested for the presence of Clostridium difficile cytotoxin and Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin. C. difficile cytotoxin was detected in faecal specimens from 0.6 % of cases aged at least 2 years by using a Vero cell assay. Factors associated with detection of C. difficile cytotoxin were antibiotic therapy, age over 60 years and living in a home with other elderly people. Three methods were used for the detection of C. perfringens enterotoxin: a Vero cell assay, a commercial (TechLab) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and an in-house EIA. The lower level of detection of pure C. perfringens enterotoxin in buffer was 0.01 micro g ml(-1) by the TechLab EIA and 1.0 micro g ml(-1) by the Vero cell assay. C. perfringens enterotoxin was detected by using the TechLab EIA in faecal specimens from 2.5 % of cases. This commercial EIA was less sensitive than the in-house EIA, detecting only 31 % of positive cases, but was specific and could be used for outbreak investigation by routine diagnostic laboratories. Age over 60 years was a factor associated with C. perfringens enterotoxin detection; this age group may be targeted for testing.
TI  - The host cell chaperone Hsp90 is essential for translocation of the binary Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin into the cytosol.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin is the prototype of the binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins and consists of the binding component C2II and the enzyme component C2I. The activated binding component C2IIa forms heptamers, which bind to carbohydrates on the cell surface and interact with the enzyme component C2I. This toxin complex is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In acidic endosomes, heptameric C2IIa forms pores and mediates the translocation of C2I into the cytosol. We report that the heat shock protein (Hsp) 90-specific inhibitors, geldanamycin or radicicol, block intoxication of Vero cells, rat astrocytes, and HeLa cells by C2 toxin. ADP-ribosylation of actin in the cytosol of toxin-treated cells revealed that less active C2I was translocated into the cytosol after treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors. Under control conditions, C2I was localized in the cytosol of toxin-treated rat astrocytes, whereas geldanamycin blocked the cytosolic distribution of C2I. At low extracellular pH (pH 4.5), which allows the direct translocation of C2I via C2IIa heptamers across the cell membrane into the cytosol, Hsp90 inhibitors retarded intoxication by C2I. Geldanamycin did not affect toxin binding, endocytosis, and pore formation by C2IIa. The ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of C2I was not affected by Hsp90 inhibitors in vitro. The cytotoxic actions of the actin-ADP-ribosylating Clostridium perfringens iota toxin and the Rho-ADP-ribosylating C2-C3 fusion toxin was similarly blocked by Hsp90 inhibitors. In contrast, radicicol and geldanamycin had no effect on anthrax lethal toxin-induced cytotoxicity of J774-A1 macrophage-like cells or on cytotoxic effects of the glucosylating Clostridium difficile toxin B in Vero cells. The data indicate that Hsp90 is essential for the membrane translocation of ADP-ribosylating toxins delivered by C2II.
TI  - In vitro activities of dalbavancin and nine comparator agents against anaerobic gram-positive species and corynebacteria.
AB  - Dalbavancin is a novel semisynthetic glycopeptide with enhanced activity against  gram-positive species. Its comparative in vitro activities and those of nine comparator agents, including daptomycin, vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin, against 290 recent gram-positive clinical isolates strains, as determined by the NCCLS agar dilution method, were studied. The MICs of dalbavancin at which 90% of various isolates tested were inhibited were as follows: Actinomyces spp., 0.5 microg/ml; Clostridium clostridioforme, 8 microg/ml; C. difficile, 0.25 microg/ml; C. innocuum, 0.25 microg/ml; C. perfringens, 0.125 microg/ml; C. ramosum, 1 microg/ml; Eubacterium spp., 1 microg/ml; Lactobacillus spp., >32 microg/ml, Propionibacterium spp., 0.5 microg/ml; and Peptostreptococcus spp., 0.25 microg/ml. Dalbavancin was 1 to 3 dilutions more active than vancomycin against most strains. Dalbavancin exhibited excellent activity against gram-positive strains tested and warrants clinical evaluation.
TI  - Hepatitis associated with Clostridium difficile in an ostrich chick.
AB  - A live 19-day-old male ostrich chick was euthanized and necropsied. It was one of 12 chicks in a group in which 8 had died with history of anorexia, diarrhoea and weight loss. The birds had been treated with amikacin, piperacillin and enrofloxacin. Necropsy of the ostrich revealed dehydration, mild ascites and serous atrophy of fat around the heart. The liver had numerous yellow tan foci on the capsular surface as well as on the cut surface. Caecal contents were watery. Microscopic examination of the liver revealed multifocal necrosis of hepatocytes with infiltration of heterophils mixed with fibrin, few lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells. A Gram stain of the liver revealed a few gram-positive bacilli scattered within the necrotic foci. Clostridium difficile was isolated from the liver, and toxin A was detected by ELISA. A retrospective examination of approximately 1000 ostriches submitted during a seven year period to the laboratory system revealed seven cases of hepatitis due to Clostridium perfringens, two additional cases due to C. difficile and two cases due to C. sordelli.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of canine Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens isolates to commonly utilized antimicrobial drugs.
AB  - Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens are anaerobic, Gram-positive bacilli that are common causes of enteritis and enterotoxemias in both domestic animals and humans. Both organisms have been associated with acute and chronic large and small bowel diarrhea, and acute hemorrhagic diarrheal syndrome in the dog. The objective of this study was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of canine C. difficile and C. perfringens isolates in an effort to optimize antimicrobial therapy for dogs with clostridial-associated diarrhea. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antibiotics recommended for treating C. difficile (metronidazole, vancomycin) and C. perfringens-associated diarrhea in the dog (ampicillin, erythromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, tylosin) were determined for 70 canine fecal C. difficile isolates and 131 C. perfringens isolates. All C. difficile isolates tested had an MIC of <or=1 for both metronidazole and vancomycin. Ninety-five percent (124/131) of C. perfringens isolates tested had an MIC for ampicillin of <or=0.125 microg/ml. Two C. perfringens isolates had an MIC of >or=256 microg/ml for both erythromycin and tylosin. A third C. perfringens isolate had an MIC of 32 microg/ml for metronidazole. Based on the results of this study, ampicillin, erythromycin, metronidazole, and tylosin appear to be effective antibiotics for the treatment of C. perfringens-associated diarrhea, although resistant strains do exist. However, because there is limited information regarding breakpoints for veterinary anaerobes, and because intestinal concentrations are not known, in vitro results should be interpreted with caution.
TI  - Identification and characteristics of nisin Z-producing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from Kimchi.
AB  - We isolated bacteriocin-producing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis from Kimchi. The bacteriocin inhibited strains of Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Listeria monocytogenes, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and one out of four methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, as well as some closely related lactic acid bacteria. In tricine-SDS-PAGE, the bacteriocin migrated with an apparent molecular weight of about 4 kDa to the same location as nisin A and crude nisin Z. The gene encoding this bacteriocin was found to be identical to that of nisin Z with direct PCR sequence methods. The inhibitory activity was stable against heat and pH, but it was lost at 100 degrees C for 1 h and at 121 degrees C for 15 min. The bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but was not affected by lysozyme, lipase, catalase, or beta-glucosidase. There were some differences in characteristics from those of nisins described previously.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile in diarrheic and healthy dogs.
AB  
TI  - Expression of Clostridium difficile toxins A and B and their sigma factor TcdD is controlled by temperature.
AB  - Growth temperature was found to control the expression of toxins A and B in Clostridium difficile VPI 10463, with a maximum at 37 degrees C and low levels at 22 and 42 degrees C in both peptone yeast (PY) and defined media. The up-regulation of toxin A and B mRNA and protein levels upon temperature upshift from 22 to 37 degrees C followed the same kinetics, showing that temperature control occurred at the level of transcription. Experiments with Clostridium perfringens using gusA as a reporter gene demonstrated that both toxin gene promoters were temperature controlled and that their high activity at 37 degrees C was dependent on the alternative sigma factor TcdD. Furthermore, tcdD was found to be autoinduced at 37 degrees C. Glucose down-regulated all these responses in the C. perfringens constructs, similar to its impact on toxin production in C. difficile PY broth cultures. C. difficile proteins induced at 37 degrees C and thus coregulated with the toxins by temperature were demonstrated by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified as enzymes involved in butyric acid production and as electron carriers in oxidation-reduction reactions. The regulation of toxin production in C. difficile by temperature is a novel finding apparently reflecting an adaptation of the expression of its virulence to mammalian hosts.
TI  - The clostridial mobilisable transposons.
AB  - Mobilisable transposons are transposable genetic elements that also encode mobilisation functions but are not in themselves conjugative. They rely on coresident conjugative elements to facilitate their transfer to recipient cells. Clostridial mobilisable transposons include Tn4451 and Tn4452 from Clostridium perfringens, and Tn4453a and Tn4453b from Clostridium difficile, all of which are closely related, and Tn5398 from C. difficile. The Tn4451 group of elements encodes resistance to chloramphenicol and is unusual in that transposition is dependent upon a large resolvase protein rather than a more conventional transposase or integrase. This group of elements also encodes the mobilisation protein TnpZ that, by acting at the RS(A) or oriT site located on the transposon, and in the presence of a coresident conjugative element, promotes the movement of the nonreplicating circular intermediate and of plasmids on which the transposon resides. The erythromycin resistance element Tn5398 is unique in that it encodes no readily identifiable transposition or mobilisation proteins. However, the element is still capable of intraspecific transfer between C. difficile isolates, by an unknown mechanism. The detailed analysis of these mobilisable clostridial elements provides evidence that the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes is a complex process that may involve the interaction of genetic elements with very different properties.
TI  - In vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, quinupristin- dalfopristin, linezolid, and five other antimicrobials against 307 gram-positive anaerobic and 31 Corynebacterium clinical isolates.
AB  - The activities of daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide, and eight other agents were determined against 338 strains of gram-positive anaerobic bacteria and corynebacteria by the NCCLS reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella agar for the anaerobes and Mueller-Hinton agar for the corynebacteria. The daptomycin MICs determined on Ca(2+)-supplemented (50 mg/liter) brucella agar plates were one- to fourfold lower than those determined in unsupplemented media. Daptomycin was highly active (MICs, <or=2 microg/ml) against many strains including 36 of 37 peptostreptococci, 37 of 48 isolates of the Eubacterium group, and all strains of Propionibacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, and other Clostridium spp. It was fourfold or greater more active than vancomycin against Clostridium innocuum and 16 of 34 strains of vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli. Three strains of C. difficile for which quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid MICs were >8 microg/ml were inhibited by <1 microg of daptomycin per ml. Daptomycin MICs were >or=4 microg/ml for most strains of Clostridium clostridioforme, Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium tertium, and Clostridium ramosum; the isolates were generally more resistant to other antimicrobials. Daptomycin was two- to fourfold less active against Actinomyces spp. than vancomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, or linezolid. Twenty-nine of 31 strains of Corynebacterium spp., including Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium amycolatum, and Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of daptomycin per ml. For two strains of "Corynebacterium aquaticum," 8 microg of daptomycin per ml was required for inhibition. Daptomycin demonstrated very good activities against a broad range of gram-positive organisms including vancomycin-resistant C. innocuum and lactobacillus strains and quinupristin-dalfopristin- and linezolid-resistant C. difficile strains.
TI  - The uptake machinery of clostridial actin ADP-ribosylating toxins--a cell delivery system for fusion proteins and polypeptide drugs.
AB  - Several bacterial protein toxins, including Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, Clostridum perfringens iota toxin, Clostridium difficile ADP-ribosyltransferase, and the Bacillus-produced vegetative insecticidal proteins, target the cytoskeleton by ADP-ribosylation of actin. All these toxins are binary in structure and consist of an enzyme component, possessing ADP-ribosyltransferase activity and a separated binding and translocation component, which is involved in the delivery of the enzyme component into the cell. The toxins are not only important virulence factors but also cell biological tools to study the function of the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, the binary toxins turned out to be effective transporter systems for the delivery of specific fusion toxins (e.g., Rho-ADP-ribosylating C3 exoenzyme) into cells. The present review describes the biological functions of the toxins, focuses on recent studies on the uptake and delivery mechanism and discusses the usage as a drug delivery system.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of Clostridium perfringens antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens has been reported as the cause of up to 15% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) and may be diagnosed by detection of enterotoxin (CPEnt) in faeces. The performance of a commercial ELISA method for CPEnt, with culture and PCR methods to confirm the presence of enterotoxigenic C. perfringens, was evaluated in 200 consecutive specimens from patients with clinical details suggestive of AAD: 8% of the specimens were positive for CPEnt, 16% were positive for C. difficile cytotoxin and 2% gave positive test results for both C. perfringens and C. difficile toxins. Culture and PCR results confirmed the majority of ELISA results, although 2 (12.5%) reactive specimens were only weakly positive. C. perfringens is a potentially important cause of infective AAD and can be detected with the C. perfringens enterotoxin ELISA kit, although weak positive results should be considered with caution.
TI  - Evaluation of a routine diagnostic fecal panel for dogs with diarrhea.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic yield of a routine fecal panel and determine whether Clostridium perfringens or C difficile toxin production is associated with acute hemorrhagic diarrheal syndrome (AHDS) in dogs. DESIGN: Case-control study. ANIMALS: 260 dogs with diarrhea and 177 dogs with normal feces. PROCEDURE: Medical records were reviewed for results of culture for C difficile, Campylobacterspp, and Salmonella spp; C perfringens fecal enterotoxin (CPE) assay via ELISA or reverse passive latex agglutination (RPLA) assay; fecal endospore enumeration; C difficile toxin A assay; and parasite evaluation. RESULTS: Prevalence of CPE in dogs with diarrhea was 22/154 (14.3%) via ELISA and 47/104 (45.2%) via RPLA assay, versus 9/74 (12%) via ELISA and 26/103 (25%) via RPLA assay in control dogs. Prevalence of C difficile was 47/260 (18%) in dogs with diarrhea and 41/74 (55%) in control dogs. Prevalence of C difficile toxin A was 26/254 (10.2%) in dogs with diarrhea and 0/74 in control dogs. Diagnosis of AHDS was made in 27 dogs; 8 had positive results for CPE, 7 had positive results for toxin A, and 1 had positive results for both toxins. Campylobacter spp were isolated from 13 of 260 (5%) dogs with diarrhea and 21 of 74 (28.4%) control dogs. Salmonella spp were isolated from 3 (1.2%) dogs with diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Diagnostic value of a fecal panel in dogs with diarrhea appears to below.
TI  - Environmental response and autoregulation of Clostridium difficile TxeR, a sigma  factor for toxin gene expression.
AB  - TxeR, a sigma factor that directs Clostridium difficile RNA polymerase to recognize the promoters of two major toxin genes, was shown to stimulate its own synthesis. Whether expressed in C. difficile, Clostridium perfringens, or Escherichia coli, TxeR stimulated transcription of fusions of the txeR promoter region to reporter genes. As is the case for the tox genes, txeR expression was responsive to the cellular growth phase and the constituents of the medium. That is, the level of expression in broth culture was low during the exponential growth phase, but rapidly increased as cells approached the stationary phase. In the presence of excess glucose, expression from the txeR promoter was repressed. The results support a model for toxin gene expression in which synthesis of TxeR is induced by specific environmental signals. The increased level of TxeR then permits high-level expression of the toxin genes. The study of txeR gene regulation in C. difficile was made possible by introduction of a mobilizable, replicative plasmid via conjugation with E. coli.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile in diarrheic and healthy dogs.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine the potential roles of Clostridium difficile and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens in diarrhea in dogs by comparison of isolation, determination of toxin status via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and application of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These techniques were used to evaluate fecal specimens in 132 healthy and diarrheic dogs. These dogs were prospectively evaluated by grouping them into the following 3 categories: hospitalized dogs with diarrhea (n = 32), hospitalized dogs without diarrhea (n = 42), and apparently healthy outpatient dogs without diarrhea (n = 58). All fecal specimens were cultured using selective media for C difficile, Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp. and selective media after heat shock for C perfringens. No significant difference was found in the isolation of C perfringens or C difficile among the 3 groups. A significant association was found between the presence of diarrhea and detection of C perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) or toxin A via ELISA for both C perfringens and C difficile, respectively. PCR performed on C difficile isolates for toxin A and toxin B genes revealed no significant differences among the 3 groups, but diarrheic dogs were significantly more likely to be positive for the enterotoxin gene of C perfringens. Based on the results of this study, the use of ELISA for detection of CPE in feces combined with the detection of enterotoxigenic fecal isolates obtained via heat shock provides the strongest evidence for the presence of C perfringens-associated diarrhea.
TI  - A survey of agents associated with neonatal diarrhea in Iowa swine including Clostridium difficile and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.
AB  - This survey was undertaken to determine the relative frequency of agents that are currently associated with neonatal diarrhea in swine, including Clostridium difficile and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The subjects for this study were the first 100 live 1-7-day-old piglets submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory with a clinical signalment of diarrhea, beginning on January 1, 2000. The evaluation of each pig included bacterial culture of a section of ileum, 2 sections of jejunum, and a single section of colon; a fluorescent antibody test (FAT) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV); ELISA's for rotavirus and C. difficile toxins; IHC for PRRSV; and microscopic examination of ileum, midjejunum, spiral colon, liver, spleen, and lung. Survey results demonstrate a decline in the relative number of diagnoses of TGEV, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens type C compared with retrospective data. The combined case frequency rate for these 3 pathogens dropped from 70% in 1988 to 21% in 2000. This survey also demonstrated the emergence of C. difficile as an important pathogen of neonatal swine. Clostridium difficle toxin was detected in the colon contents of 29% of the piglets, and at least 1 toxin-positive animal was identified in 55% of the cases. All 29 C. difficile toxin-positive piglets had mesocolonic edema, and colitis was observed in 21 of 29 toxin-positive animals. PRRSV-positive macrophages were detected in the lamina propria of intestinal villi by IHC in 10 piglets with diarrhea. In 6 of these cases, PRRSV was the only pathogen detected. Gross and microscopic lung lesions were not a reliable indicator of PRRSV infection in these neonatal pigs with diarrhea. The addition of tests for C. difficile and PRRSV to a routine neonatal diarrhea diagnostic protocol resulted in a significant increase in thediagnostic success rate on both individual animal and case bases.
TI  - Design of species-specific primers to identify 13 species of Clostridium harbored in human intestinal tracts.
AB  - The genus Clostridium is dominant in human intestinal tracts and plays an important role in human health. We designed species-specific primers to identify 13 species of Clostridium (C. perfringens, C. paraputrificum, C. bifermentans, C. difficile, C. clostridiiforme, C. nexile, C. sphenoides, C. indolis, C. ramosum, C. cocleatum, C. butyricum, C. sordellii, and C. innocuum) easily and rapidly. The PCR annealing temperature was set at a uniform 60 C for application to all strains at the same time. To confirm the specificities of these primers, 85 intestinal bacteria in total, including type strains, reference strains, and isolates were used. Ten primers (including those for C. perfringens to C. cocleatum) indicated high specificities. Although there were some cross-reactions with the other three primers, the target species were distinguishable from other bacteria by the different sizes of PCR products.
TI  - Analysis of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) resistance determinant in strains of Clostridium difficile.
AB  - The macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) resistance determinants have been detected among Clostridia in both C. perfringens and C. difficile strains. Previous studies have shown that MLSB-resistant C. difficile strains can be differentiated by specific hybridizing bands using an erm(B) probe. A recent study has demonstrated that C. difficile 630, a strain highly resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin (MIC > or = 256 ml/L), showing a hybridizing band at 9.7 kb, contains two copies of an erm(B) gene. It was also hypothesized that C. difficile 630 erm(B) determinant has arisen from a progenitor, represented by the C. perfringens CP592 determinant, which contains only one copy of an erm(B) gene that differs from C. difficile 630 erm(B) for seven nucleotide substitutions. To investigate the possibility that C. difficile strains with hybridizing fragments of different molecular size have an erm(B) determinant not identical to the one described in C. difficile 630, we performed a genetic analysis on the erm(B) determinant in 18 C. difficile strains, isolated from different sources. The results showed a heterogeneity in erm(B) determinant: C. difficile strains with hybridizing bands at 7.3 or 3.7 kb contained only one erm(B) copy, whereas strains with a band at 9.7 kb had two copies. The majority of the toxigenic strains examined was characterized by only one erm(B) copy with a sequence identical to the one found in C. difficile 630 and a lower resistance level for erythromycin (MICs ranging from 16 to 24 ml/L). Differently, some strains had an erm(B) gene identical to the one found in C. perfringens CP592. PCR ribotyping and clustering analysis indicate that the examined resistant strains, except one, belong to the same genetic lineage. These results seem to support the hypothesis of the evolution of the C. difficile 630 erm(B) determinant. The functional significance of one or two copies of erm(B) gene in C. difficile strains should be further investigated.
TI  - Characterization of Clostridium perfringens strains isolated from Polish patients with suspected antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of our research was to investigate the role of enterotoxin- producing anaerobic bacteria other than Clostridium difficile in the etiology of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This article presents data related to C. perfringens. MATERIAL/METHODS: Stool samples taken from 158 patients with suspected antibiotic-associated diarrhea were specifically cultured for Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. In order to associate the presence of virulence factors in the bacterial isolates thus collected with disease features, all strains were genetically and phenotypically analyzed for toxin production. All isolated C. perfringens strains were cultured in Ellner sporulation-promoting medium. RESULTS: In 21 of the 158 patients (13%) C. perfringens could be cultivated from the fecal specimen. None of the strains produced enterotoxin, and consequently the cpe gene was not detected by PCR in any of these strains. C. perfringens and C. difficile were cultivated from the same stool samples in 4 cases. Interestingly, in one case toxin A-negative/toxin B positive C. difficile and non-enterotoxigenic C. perfringens were co-cultured. After application of a heat shock (100 degrees C at 30 min.) only two C. perfringens strains producing thermoresistant spores were detected. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) demonstrated genetic heterogenicity among the C. perfringens strains, suggesting that these bacteria were already presented upon hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: It seems unlikely that nosocomial transfer has taken place. The relatively low incidence suggests that C. perfringens is not a major primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
TI  - Antianaerobic activity of a cecropin---melittin peptide.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several small, 15-residue peptides that contain portions of the amino  acid sequences of both cecropin A and melittin have previously been shown to have broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against aerobic microorganisms, with no undesirable hemolytic properties. It would also be useful to know what effect these hybrid peptides have on anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of one hybrid, CA(1--7)M(2--9)NH2, were compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against 111 clinical anaerobic strains; Bacteroides fragilis, 24 strains; other Bacteroides fragilis group, 14 strains; other Bacteroides species, 13 strains; Fusobacterium nucleatum, six strains; Clostridium difficile, 22 strains; Clostridium perfringens, 10 strains, Propionibacterium spp., nine strains; and anaerobic cocci, 13 strains. RESULTS: Ninety per cent of strains belonging to the B. fragilis group, fusobacteria, propionibacteria and peptostreptococci were inhibited by 4 mg/L CA(1--7)M(2--9)NH2, and the antimicrobial activity was approximately in the same range as that of chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: This investigation showed that the antimicrobial spectrum of this cecropin---melittin hybrid also includes anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Similar frequency of detection of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and Clostridium difficile toxins in patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  
TI  - Evidence for antibiotic induced Clostridium perfringens diarrhoea.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a well documented cause of antibiotic associated diarrhoea in hospitalised patients, but may account for only approximately 20% of all cases. This leader reviews the current knowledge and understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and diagnosis of non-food borne Clostridium perfringens diarrhoea. Although enterotoxigenic C perfringens has been implicated in some C difficile negative cases of antibiotic associated diarrhoea, C perfringens enterotoxin detection methods are not part of the routine laboratory investigation of such cases. Testing for C perfringens enterotoxin in faecal samples from patients with antibiotic associated diarrhoea and sporadic diarrhoea on a routine basis would have considerable resource implications. Therefore, criteria for initiating investigations and optimum laboratory tests need to be established. In addition, establishing the true burden of C perfringens antibiotic associated diarrhoea is important before optimum control and treatment measures can be defined.
TI  - Characterization of the enzymatic component of the ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin CDTa from Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Certain strains of Clostridium difficile produce the ADP-ribosyltransferase CDT,  which is a binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxin. The toxin consists of the binding component CDTb, which mediates receptor binding and cellular uptake, and the enzyme component CDTa. Here we studied the enzyme component (CDTa) of the toxin using the binding component of Clostridium perfringens iota toxin (Ib), which is interchangeable with CDTb as a transport component. Ib was used because CDTb was not expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. Similar to iota toxin, CDTa ADP-ribosylates nonmuscle and skeletal muscle actin. The N-terminal part of CDTa (CDTa1-240) competes with full-length CDTa for binding to the iota toxin binding component. The C-terminal part (CDTa244-263) harbors the enzyme activity but was much less active than the full-length CDTa. Changes of Glu428 and Glu430 to glutamine, Ser388 to alanine, and Arg345 to lysine blocked ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Comparison of CDTa with C. perfringens iota toxin and Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin revealed full enzyme activity of the fragment Ia208-413 but loss of activity of several N-terminally deleted C2I proteins including C2I103-431, C2I190-431, and C2I30-431. The data indicate that CDTa belongs to the iota toxin subfamily of binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins with respect to interaction with the binding component and substrate specificity. It shares typical conserved amino acid residues with iota toxin and C2 toxin that are suggested to be involved in NAD-binding and/or catalytic activity. The enzyme components of CDT, iota toxin, and C2 toxin differ with respect to the minimal structural requirement for full enzyme activity.
TI  - A prospective study of the roles of clostridium difficile and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens in equine diarrhoea.
AB  - Faecal samples from adult horses and from foals with diarrhoea or with normal faeces were evaluated for the presence of Clostridium difficile, C. difficile toxins, C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and C. perfringens spore counts. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 7/55 horses (12.7%) and 11/31 foals (35.5%) with colitis, but from 1/255 normal adults (0.4%) and 0/47 normal foals (P<0.001). Clostridium difficile toxins A and/or B were detected in 12/55 diarrhoeic adults (21.8%) and 5/30 diarrhoeic foals (16.7%) but in only 1/83 adults (1.2%) and 0/21 foals with normal faeces (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 9/47 diarrhoeic adults (19%) and 8/28 diarrhoeic foals (28.6%), but was not detected in 47 adult horses (P<0.002) or 4 foals (P = 0.22) with normal faeces. The positive predictive value of isolation of C. perfringens with respect to the presence of CPE was only 60% in adult horses and 64% in foals. There was no association between total C. perfringens spore count and CPE in the faeces. The overall mortality rate from colitis was 22% for adult horses and 18% for foals. Clostridium difficile toxin-positive adult horses with colitis were less likely to survive than C. difficile-negative horses with colitis (P = 0.03). This study provides further evidence that C. difficile and enterotoxigenic C. perfringens are associated with equine enterocolitis.
TI  - The roles of Clostridium difficile and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens in diarrhea in dogs.
AB  - In this prospective study, feces of dogs with diarrhea were compared with feces of normal dogs for the presence of Clostridium difficile, C difficile toxins A and B, C perfringens, and C perfingens enterotoxin (CPE). C difficile toxins A, B, or both were present in feces of 18 of 87 (21%) dogs with diarrhea and 4 of 55 (7%) normal dogs (P = 0.03), whereas CPE was present in the feces of 24 of 87 (28%) dogs with diarrhea and 3 of 55 (5%) normal dogs (P = 0.01). C difficile was isolated from 2 of 87 (2%) dogs with diarrhea but was not isolated from the feces of 55 normal dogs, possibly because of poor survival of the organism in fecal samples. C perfringens was isolated from the feces of 23 of 24 (96%) CPE-positive dogs with diarrhea, 52 of 63 (83%) CPE-negative dogs with diarrhea, and 39 of 55 (71%) CPE-negative dogs with normal feces. No correlation was found between C perfringens spore number and the presence of CPE.
TI  - Intestinal epithelial damage in sids babies and its similarity to that caused by  bacterial toxins in the rabbit.
AB  - Sections of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and large intestine from 14 sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) babies were examined by scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The type and amount of damage was characterised and quantitated and compared with the presence of Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in faecal samples from the babies and toxins from the bacteria in faecal samples and serum from the babies. The data were compared with the damage that these toxins cause to the rabbit intestinal epithelium (see the previous paper in this issue). Damage was present in most of the SIDS samples, varying from 0 to 96%, and most damage occurred when the faecal samples contained the above bacteria and their toxins. Damage varied from removal of microvilli, damage to villus tips, separation of and removal of epithelial cells from the lamina propria, and removal of enterocytes leaving goblet and tuft cells, to damage and breakdown of the lamina propria. The results support the hypothesis that the cause of death in a significant proportion of SIDS babies may result from the absorption of toxins from the intestinal tract initiating a toxic shock reaction.
TI  - The effect of bacterial enterotoxins implicated in SIDS on the rabbit intestine.
AB  - The aim of this project was to characterise the type of damage caused to the intestine of the infant rabbit by bacterial enterotoxins implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Samples of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and large intestine exposed to the toxins for up to 6 hours were examined by scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The damage was quantitatively assessed (% villi damaged) by SEM and qualitatively by SEM and TEM. Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin B and Clostridium difficile toxin A + toxin B combined all caused severe damage to the villi in the small intestine (80-90% damage). Clostridium difficile toxin B caused only slight damage (17% to the jejunum, 26% to the caecum). Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin caused moderate damage to the small intestine (duodenum 34%, caecum 35%), and Escherichia coli STa caused significant damage to the small (53-70%) and large intestine (51%). The level of toxin damage increased with time, the small intestine being more susceptible generally to damage than the large intestine. Each toxin differed in its ability to damage the villi, microvilli, enterocytes and lamina propria.
TI  - Linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. It has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroidesfragilis. In controlled phase III studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. Further phase III studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments, including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated SSTIs. Oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated SSTIs or community-acquired pneumonia. Linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. The most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of S. aureus (including GISA), Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis (including VRE). In controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. As the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among S. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
TI  - Comparison of Tn5397 from Clostridium difficile, Tn916 from Enterococcus faecalis and the CW459tet(M) element from Clostridium perfringens shows that they have similar conjugation regions but different insertion and excision modules.
AB  - Comparative analysis of the conjugative transposons Tn5397 from Clostridium difficile and Tn916 from Enterococcus faecalis, and the CW459tet(M) element from Clostridium perfringens, has revealed that these tetracycline-resistance elements are closely related. All three elements contain the tet(M) resistance gene and have sequence similarity throughout their central region. However, they have very different integration/excision modules. Instead of the int and xis genes that are found in Tn916, Tn5397 has a large resolvase gene, tndX. The C. perfringens element encodes the putative Int459 protein, which is a member of the integrase family of site-specific recombinases but is not closely related to Int from Tn916. Based on these studies it is concluded that the clostridial elements have a modular genetic organization and were derived independently from distinct mobile genetic elements.
TI  - [Intestinal flora of patients with suspected antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD). I. Clostridium perfringens].
AB  - Stool samples of 158 patients suspected of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD)  were studied. Toxin A of C. difficile and enterotoxin of C. perfringens were detected in stool samples by immunoenzymatic assays and PCR. In 35 stool samples toxin A of C. difficile was detected and in 48 cases (30%) C. difficile strains were cultured from 21 stool samples (13%). The presence of the cpe gene of C. perfringens, enabling the production of enterotoxin, could not be detected by PCR, both in stool samples and in isolated strains, using ent 1 and ent 2 primer pairs. C. difficile and C. perfringens were isolated from the same stool samples in 4 cases. From stool samples of two patients with AAD C. perfringens strains, thermoresistant spores were cultured.
TI  - In vitro activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against 502 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In a previous study, we compared HMR 3004 with azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin against 502 anaerobic bacteria using NCCLS-approved procedures. This report extends this study by reporting the activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against these strains. Telithromycin inhibited 10% of Bacteroides fragilis, 50% of other B. fragilis group organisms and 93% of other Bacteroides spp. Telithromycin inhibited all Porphyromonas spp. and 98% of Prevotella spp. Activity against Bilophila wadsworthia (85-96%) was excellent. Telithromycin was not active against the Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium group. Telithromycin inhibited 100% of Clostridium perfringens, 46-56% of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium ramosum and approximately 90% of non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Clostridial enterocolitis.
AB  - Equine clostridial enterocolitis is being recognized with increasing frequency. It has been identified in foals with diarrhea, antibiotic-associated enterocolitis, or nosocomial enterocolitis. The sporadic occurrence of clostridial enterocolitis, the variety of types of clostridia involved, and the difficulty of experimentally reproducing the disease suggest that it is a poorly defined multifactorial syndrome. The risk factors associated with susceptibility to colonization and progressive infection are largely based on anecdotal observations and extrapolation from human studies. Quantitative studies are needed to decipher the complex interactions between host and indigenous microflora that provide for and maintain a healthy colonization resistance environment. It seems that such studies might be more beneficial in furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of clostridial enterocolitis than attempting to implicate another agent or toxin as the sole cause of the disease in equids. Treatment protocols that interrupt the pathogenesis of the disease need to be devised and critically evaluated to complement the present protocols emphasizing supportive care. Perhaps it is time to consider clostridial enterocolitis as yet another consequence of the use of antimicrobials analogous to the selective pressures that result in the emergence of multiple drug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for Actinomyces spp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. The MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for Eubacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium ramosum. The MIC(90) for Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for Prevotella bivia and other Prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC(90) for Fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. The MIC(90)s for the Bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for B. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for Bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. Telithromycin MICs for the B. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than ABT-773 MICs. For all strains, ABT-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
TI  - Bacterial toxins modifying the actin cytoskeleton.
AB  - Numerous bacterial toxins recognize the actin cytoskeleton as a target. The clostridial binary toxins (Iota and C2 families) ADP-ribosylate the actin monomers causing the dissociation of the actin filaments. The large clostridial toxins from Clostridium difficile, Clostridium sordellii and Clostridium novyi inactivate, by glucosylation, proteins from the Rho family that regulate actin polymerization. In contrast, the cytotoxic necrotic factor from Escherichia coli activates Rho by deamidation and increases the formation of actin filaments. The enterotoxin of Bacteroides fragilis is a protease specific for E-cadherin and it promotes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The bacterial toxins that modify the actin cytoskeleton induce various cell disfunctions including changes in cell barrier permeability and disruption of intercellular junctions.
TI  - Transposition of Tn4451 and Tn4453 involves a circular intermediate that forms a  promoter for the large resolvase, TnpX.
AB  - Tn4451 is the paradigm element of a family of mobilizable chloramphenicol resistance transposons from Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile. The unique feature of these 6.3 kb elements is that their excision to form a circular molecule is mediated by TnpX, a member of the large resolvase family of site-specific recombinases. By optimizing the transposition assay system in Escherichia coli, we showed that Tn4453a from C. difficile transposed at a higher frequency than the C. perfringens element, Tn4451, and that transposition of both Tn4451 and Tn4453a was significantly enhanced by the provision of a multicopy tnpX gene in trans. The complete nucleotide sequence of Tn4453a was determined, but its comparison with Tn4451 did not reveal why it transposed at a higher frequency. Using experiments involving a chromosomal derivative of Tn4453a, we have confirmed that the circular form is the transposition intermediate. As the tnpX gene is located very close to one end of these elements, primer extension analysis was used to determine the transcription start point. The results showed that the formation of the circular intermediate creates a strong tnpX promoter, which consists of a -10 box originally located at the left end of the transposon and a -35 box originally located at the right end. The data provide strong evidence that transcription of tnpX is likely to occur from the non-replicating circular intermediate, which would facilitate the subsequent insertion of the transient circular molecule. It is postulated that, when the transposon is in an integrated state, transcription of tnpX would depend on the presence of an appropriately spaced -35 sequence in the DNA flanking the insertion site or the presence of an alternative upstream promoter.
TI  - [Detection of toxin-producing pathogenic bacterial strains by polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of pathogenic Clostridium  botulinum, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, and Escherichia coli. With this aim in view, primers to botulinic toxins types A, B, C1, D, E, F, and G, perfringens enterotoxin, difficile toxin, and types 1 and 2 Shigella-like toxins were chosen and synthesized. Optimal amplification conditions were selected for each pair of primers, with DNA and the respective agent as the reaction mixture matrices. PCR was highly specific and sensitive in all cases. Its sensitivity was 10-100 cells/sample. Among the tested C. botulinum, C. perfringens, C. difficile, and E. coli strains, specific amplification products of expected size were observed only in the strains containing the respective toxin genes. These findings recommend the use of these methods in clinical microbiology. Strains containing type 2 Shigella-like toxin gene were detected among E. coli strains isolated from patients with the hemolytic uremic syndrome, which for the first time indicates that the problem with E. coli epidemic strain O157 is valid for Russia. As a result of our studies, test systems for detection of types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G C. botulinum strains, C. perfringens and C. difficile, and E. coli O157 strains are now available.
TI  - Characterization of the ends and target sites of the novel conjugative transposon Tn5397 from Clostridium difficile: excision and circularization is mediated by the large resolvase, TndX.
AB  - Tn5397 is a conjugative transposon that was originally isolated from Clostridium  difficile. Previous analysis had shown that the central region of Tn5397 was closely related to the conjugative transposon Tn916. However, in this work we obtained the DNA sequence of the ends of Tn5397 and showed that they are completely different to those of Tn916. Tn5397 did not contain the int and xis genes, which are required for the excision and integration of Tn916. Instead, the right end of Tn5397 contained a gene, tndX, that appears to encode a member of the large resolvase family of site-specific recombinases. TndX is closely related to the TnpX resolvase from the mobilizable but nonconjugative chloramphenicol resistance transposons, Tn4451 from Clostridium perfringens and Tn4453 from C. difficile. Like the latter elements, inserted copies of Tn5397 were flanked by a direct repeat of a GA dinucleotide. The Tn5397 target sites were also shown to contain a central GA dinucleotide. Excision of the element in C. difficile completely regenerated the original target sequence. A circular form of the transposon, in which the left and right ends of the element were separated by a GA dinucleotide, was detected by PCR in both Bacillus subtilis and C. difficile. A Tn5397 mutant in which part of tndX was deleted was constructed in B. subtilis. This mutant was nonconjugative and did not produce the circular form of Tn5397, indicating that the TndX resolvase has an essential role in the excision and transposition of Tn5397 and is thus the first example of a member of the large resolvase family of recombinases being involved in conjugative transposon mobility. Finally, we showed that introduction of Tn916 into a strain containing Tn5397 induced the loss of the latter element in 95.6% of recipients.
TI  - Intestinal colonization leading to fecal urobilinoid excretion may play a role in the pathogenesis of neonatal jaundice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia remains of concern because of the potential danger for the central nervous system. Because urobilinogen is a nontoxic derivative of bilirubin, the current study was conducted to examine the fecal excretion of urobilinoids and bilirubin in healthy newborns and infants, as well as their intestinal bacteria capable of reducing bilirubin, to assess a possible relation to serum bilirubin levels during the first weeks of life. METHODS: Bilirubin pigments, urobilinoids, and porphyrins were measured in stools of infants during the first week (group A, n = 60) and between the second week and the first 6 months of life (group B, n = 64). Microbiologic analysis of stools was performed in selected cases and bilirubin-converting activity of isolated bacteria was determined in vitro. RESULTS: Urobilinoids were detectable in stools of 57% of the neonates at day 5, but not before. However, fecal urobilinoid production on that day was only a fraction of that observed in adults (0.07 vs. 0.7-3.6 mg/kg per day), whereas at week 6 it increased significantly to an average of 0.9 mg/kg per day. Microbiologic analysis of neonatal stools revealed two novel bacterial strains of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile capable of reducing bilirubin to urobilinoids. CONCLUSIONS: Urobilinoids can be detected in stools of 57% of newborns at day 5 after delivery. However, the urobilinoid production during the first week of life is quantitatively insufficient to contribute significantly to the removal of bilirubin. Enhancement of the microbial conversion of bilirubin could decrease the intestinal concentration of bilirubin and may decrease the degree or enhance the removal of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
TI  - The macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance determinant from Clostridium difficile 630 contains two erm(B) genes.
AB  - The ErmB macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) resistance determinant from  Clostridium difficile 630 contains two copies of an erm(B) gene, separated by a 1.34-kb direct repeat also found in an Erm(B) determinant from Clostridium perfringens. In addition, both erm(B) genes are flanked by variants of the direct repeat sequence. This genetic arrangement is novel for an ErmB MLS resistance determinant.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Aristolochia paucinervis Pomel.
AB  - Several fractions of the methanolic extract of the rhizome or the leaves of Aristolochia paucinervis Pomel were screened for antibacterial activity using the agar dilution method against fourteen reference bacterial strains. Only three fractions (defatted chloroformic rhizome fraction: APRC, rhizome ethyl acetate fraction: APRE and leaf chloroform fraction: APLC) showed an activity against at least one of the microorganisms tested. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination showed that APRC was the most active against Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis. The high bacteriostatic activity of APRC was confirmed by its MIC determination against clinical strains of C. perfringens (n = 32), C. difficile (n = 31), and E. faecalis (n = 22). Results of this study suggest the potential interest of this highly active fraction and support the use of A. paucinervis Pomel in Moroccan traditional medicine to treat skin and soft-tissue infections, especially gas gangrene and intestinal diseases.
TI  - Epidemics of diarrhea caused by a clindamycin-resistant strain of Clostridium difficile in four hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large outbreaks of diarrhea caused by a newly recognized strain of Clostridium difficile occurred in four hospitals located in different parts of the United States between 1989 and 1992. Since frequent use of clindamycin was associated with the outbreak in one of the hospitals, we examined the resistance genes of the epidemic-strain isolates and studied the role of clindamycin use in these outbreaks. METHODS: Case-control studies were performed at three of the four hospitals to assess the relation of the use of clindamycin to C. difficile-associated diarrhea. All isolates of the epidemic strain and representative isolates of other strains identified during each outbreak were tested for susceptibility to clindamycin. Chromosomal DNA from these representative isolates was also analyzed by dot blot hybridization and amplification with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the use of probes and primers from a previously described determinant of erythromycin resistance - the erythromycin ribosomal methylase B (ermB) gene - found in C. perfringens and C. difficile. RESULTS: In a stratified analysis of the case-control studies with pooling of the results according to the Mantel-Haenszel method, we found that the use of clindamycin was significantly increased among patients with diarrhea due to the epidemic strain of C. difficile, as compared with patients whose diarrhea was due to nonepidemic strains (pooled odds ratio, 4.35; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.02 to 9.38; P<0.001). Exposure to other types of antibiotics or hospitalization in a surgical ward was not significantly associated with the risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea due to the epidemic strain. All epidemic-strain isolates were highly resistant to clindamycin (minimal inhibitory concentration, >256 microg per milliliter). DNA hybridization and PCR analysis showed that all these isolates had an ermB gene, which encodes a 23S ribosomal RNA methylase that mediates resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin antibiotics. Only 15 percent of the nonepidemic strains were resistant to clindamycin. CONCLUSIONS: A strain of C. difficile that is highly resistant to clindamycin was responsible for large outbreaks of diarrhea in four hospitals in different states. The use of clindamycin is a specific risk factor for diarrhea due to this strain. Resistance to clindamycin further increases the risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea, an established complication of antimicrobial use.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - Immunological evidence for a bacterial toxin aetiology in sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Toxin-specific antibodies to clostridial, enterobacterial and staphylococcal toxins implicated in sudden infant death syndrome were studied in sera from sudden infant death syndrome infants and a comparison group of infants (babies with phenylketonuria). The results indicated a higher proportion of sera from sudden infant death syndrome infants contained IgA that bound to clostridial and enterobacterial toxins but a higher proportion of sera from the phenylketonuria comparison group contained IgA that bound staphylococcal toxins. The higher proportion of serum samples with IgG and IgM in the healthy comparison babies serum probably indicated immunity in this group of babies to these toxins. The effect of gender and age had a minimal effect on the incidence of these antibodies. The presence of toxin-specific antibodies in sudden infant death syndrome and the of comparison infants suggests that all infants are exposed to these toxins and most babies successfully overcome the toxic challenge. Some infants with predisposing risk factors (temperature change, smoking, infection, immune development, sleeping position, etc.) that could affect the baby's immune competency could succumb to these and possibly other toxins. This immunological evidence further strengthens the view that bacterial toxins are a significant cause of sudden infant death syndrome.
TI  - Prevalence of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and Clostridium difficile toxin A in feces of horses with diarrhea and colic.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence of clostridial enterotoxins in feces of horses with diarrhea and colic, and to determine whether an association exists between detection of clostridial enterotoxins in feces and development of diarrhea as a complication of colic. DESIGN: Prospective case series and case-control study. ANIMALS: 174 horses with diarrhea, colic, or problems not related to the gastrointestinal tract. PROCEDURE: Horses were assigned to 1 of 4 groups: colic with diarrhea (group 1; n = 30); colic without diarrhea (group 2; 30); diarrhea without colic (group 3; 57); and control (group 4; 57). Feces were evaluated by use of ELISA to detect Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and C difficile toxin A (TOXA). Frequency of detection of CPE or TOXA in groups 1 and 3 was compared with that in groups 2 and 4, respectively. RESULTS: Prevalence of enteric clostridiosis in horses in group 3 was 25%. Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 9 of 57 (16%), TOXA in 8 of 57 (14%), and both toxins in 3 of 57 (5%) fecal samples collected from these horses. Neither toxin was detected in feces of the age-matched horses in group 4. Clostridial enterotoxins were detected in feces of 7 of 60 (12%) horses with colic (groups 1 and 2), however, a significant association was not found between detection of enterotoxins in feces and development of diarrhea as a complication of colic. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clostridia are important etiologic agents of diarrhea in horses. Additionally, changes in intestinal flora of horses with colic may allow for proliferation of clostridia and elaboration of enterotoxins regardless of whether diarrhea develops.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY 333328 against anaerobic gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - LY 333328 is a new semisynthetic glycopeptide with reported activity against aerobic Gram-positive cocci such as enterococci, pneumococci, streptococci and staphylococci. The present investigation was undertaken to determine the in vitro activity of LY 333328 against 178 Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria recently isolated from human infections. The activity was compared with that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. Peptostreptococci (48 strains): LY 333328, range 0.016-1.0 mg/l; vancomycin, 0.125-2.0 mg/l; teicoplanin, 0.032-2.0 mg/l; cefoxitin, 0.064-8.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.016-0.064 mg/l; clindamycin, 0.016-1.0 mg/l; metronidazole, 0.125-8.0 mg/l. Propionibacterium acnes (31 strains): LY 333328, range 0.032-0.125 mg/l; vancomycin, 0.25-0.5 mg/l; teicoplanin, 0.25-0.5 mg/l; cefoxitin, 0.125-1.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.032-0.064 mg/l; clindamycin, 0.016-0.064 mg/l; metronidazole, 32-> or =64 mg/l. Clostridium difficile (50 strains): LY 333328, range 0.016-2.0 mg/l; vancomycin, 0.5-4.0 mg/l; teicoplanin, 0.064-0.5 mg/l; cefoxitin, 64-128 mg/l; imipenem, 8.0 mg/l; clindamycin, 0.25-128 mg/l; metronidazole, 0.125-0.25 mg/l. Clostridium perfringens (49 strains): LY 333328, range 0.016-2.0 mg/l; vancomycin, 0.025-4.0 mg/l; teicoplanin, 0.064-4.0 mg/l; cefoxitin, 0.5-1.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.016-0.5 mg/l; clindamycin, 0.008-1.0 mg/l; metronidazole, 1.0-4.0 mg/l. LY 333328 had an excellent in vitro activity against anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Human diseases caused by exotoxins produced by anaerobes and their rapid detection.
AB  - Major human diseases caused by exotoxins produced by anaerobes include botulisms, tetanus, foodborne illness caused by enterotoxin-producing Clostridium perfringens, and diarrhea/colitis caused by toxigenic Clostridium difficile. Recently, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) has been recognized, that may be related to childhood diarrheal disease. Detection test of botulinal neurotoxin is hardly performed at clinical laboratories since the most reliable means of detection and identification of botulinal toxin is by using mouse toxicity and neutralization tests. Clinical laboratories should request the tests to a reference laboratory. Since tetanus is easily diagnosed clinically on the basis of its unique, recognizable sings, the bacteriological tests is not usually requested. C. perfringens foodborne illness can be confirmed by testing stool specimens or the suspect food(s) for enterotoxin by the reversed passive latex agglutination test or counting > 10 5 C. perfringens per g of suspected food or > 10 6 C. perfringens spores per g of stool. Diagnosis of C. difficile-associated diarrhea/colitis is confirmed by detection of toxins A or B of C. difficile and/or recovery of toxigenic C. difficile. Isolation of C. difficile strains or detection C. difficile-speciffic antigen from stool specimens is less diagnostic since nontoxic or toxin A positive-toxin B negative strains are prevalent in Japan. Reliable laboratory tests for ETBF-associated childhood diarrhea are not established yet although ETBF can be proved by polymerase chain reaction for detection of the enterotoxin gene.
TI  - Comparative anti-anaerobic activity of Men 10700, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Men 10700, a new penem, has been compared with that of metronidazole, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav, imipenem and three third generation cephalosporins against 120 strains of anaerobes. The organisms tested comprised Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis and speciated members of the genera Fusobacterium, Veillonella and Peptostreptococcus. Men 10700 showed activity similar to that of imipenem, and was more potent than metronidazole against all species except C. difficile and P. anaerobius. The spectrum of activity of Men 10700 suggests this agent may be useful for treating infections caused by anaerobes.
TI  - Clostridial pathogenicity in experimental necrotising enterocolitis in gnotobiotic quails and protective role of bifidobacteria.
AB  - The pathogenesis of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remains unclear. Gnotobiotic quails fed a lactose diet have been used to investigate the role of clostridial strains originating from faecal specimens of neonates through the intestinal lesions, the changes in microflora balance and the production of bacterial metabolites, i.e., short-chain fatty acids and hydrogen. Bifidobacteria are thought to exert various beneficial effects on host health, including interaction with the colonic microflora. Therefore, it was hypothesised that a protective role could be exercised through bifidobacterial colonisation. A Clostridium butyricum strain (CB 155-3) and a whole faecal flora including three clostridial species (C. butyricum, C. perfringens, C. difficile), each from premature infants suffering from NEC, caused caecal lesions in quails similar to those observed in man, i.e., thickening of the caecal wall with gas cysts, haemorrhagic ulceration and necrotic areas. Conversely, a whole faecal flora including bifidobacteria (identified as Bifidobacterium pseudo-catenulatum) and no clostridia, isolated from a healthy premature infant, was unable to produce NEC-like lesions. When the two clostridial groups were associated with a Bifidobacterium strain (B. infantis-longum, CUETM 89-215, isolated from a healthy infant), bifidobacterial colonisation suppressed all pathological lesions. This study is the first demonstration of a protective role for bifidobacteria against NEC via the inhibition of growth of C. butyricum or the disappearance of C. perfringens. C. difficile was not found to be responsible for the aetiology of the caecal lesions in quails. The main effect of bifidobacteria on lactose fermentation was either a dramatic decrease or a disappearance of butyric acid. The protective role was not associated with changes in H2 production. Therefore, a new step between colonic colonisation and its relevance to NEC is thought to involve the fermentation of unabsorbed lactose into butyric acid at the onset of the disease.
TI  - TetR is a positive regulator of the tetanus toxin gene in Clostridium tetani and  is homologous to botR.
AB  - The TetR gene immediately upstream from the tetanus toxin (TeTx) gene was characterized. It encodes a 21,562-Da protein which is related (50 to 65% identity) to the equivalent genes (botR) in Clostridium botulinum. TetR has the feature of a DNA binding protein with a basic pI (9.53). It contains a helix-turn-helix motif and shows 29% identity with other putative regulatory genes in Clostridium, i.e., uviA from C. perfringens and txeR from C. difficile. We report for the first time the transformation of C. tetani by electroporation, which permitted us to investigate the function of tetR. Overexpression of tetR in C. tetani induced an increase in TeTx production and in the level of the corresponding mRNA. This indicates that TetR is a transcriptional activator of the TeTx gene. Overexpression of botR/A (60% identity with TetR at the amino acid level) in C. tetani induced an increase in TeTx production comparable to that for overexpression of tetR. However, botR/C (50% identity with TetR at the amino acid level) was less efficient. This supports that TetR positively regulates the TeTx gene in C. tetani and that a conserved mechanism of regulation of the neurotoxin genes is involved in C. tetani and C. botulinum.
TI  - Mechanisms and management of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  - Only 10%-20% of all cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) are caused by infection with Clostridium difficile. Other infectious organisms causing AAD include Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Candida species, and Salmonella species. Most of the clinically mild AAD cases are due to functional disturbances of intestinal carbohydrate or bile acid metabolism, to allergic and toxic effects of antibiotics on intestinal mucosa, or to pharmacological effects on motility. Saccharomyces boulardii and Enterococcus SF68 can reduce the risk of developing AAD. Patients receiving antibiotic treatment should avoid food containing high amounts of poorly absorbable carbohydrates. Mild cases of AAD that may or may not be caused by C. difficile can be resolved by discontinuation of antibiotic therapy and by dietary carbohydrate reduction. Only severe AAD caused by C. difficile requires specific antibiotic treatment.
TI  - In vitro activity of HMR 3647 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to determine the in vitro activity of HMR 3647 compared with other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria. The activity of HMR 3647 was determined against 342 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria by the agar dilution method and was compared with azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, erythromycin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. Among the macrolides HMR 3647 and among the beta-lactams imipenem were the most active agents tested. Anaerobic cocci (50 strains) had the following minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs): HMR 3647, range 0.016-0.125 mg/l; imipenem, range 0.016-0.064 mg/l. Propionibacterium acnes (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-1.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.032-0.064 mg/l. Clostridium perfringens (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.125 mg/l; imipenem, 0.016-0.5 mg/l. Clostridium difficile (50 strains): HMR 3647, 0.125-256 mg/l; imipenem, 4.0-8.0 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis (102 strains): HMR 3647, 0.032-16 mg/l; imipenem, 0.064-0.25 mg/l. Bacteroides and Prevotella species (50 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-4.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.016-0.25 mg/l. Fusobacterium nucleatum (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-8.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.008-0.064 mg/l. HMR 3647 may be useful as treatment and prophylaxis for infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039 and five other antimicrobial agents  against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039 against 360 anaerobic clinical isolates was  determined by the agar dilution method and compared to that of five other antimicrobial agents. BAY 12-8039 and imipenem were the most active agents tested. The following MIC90 values were determined for BAY 12-8039: Peptostreptococcus spp. (50 isolates), 1 mg/l; Propionibacterium acnes (30 isolates). 0.25 mg/l; Clostridium perfringens (30 isolates), 0.5 mg/l; Clostridium difficile (50 isolates), 2 mg/l; Bacteroides fragilis (50 isolates), 1 mg/l; non-fragilis Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella spp. (100 isolates), 2 mg/l; and Fusobacterium spp. (50 isolates), 0.25 mg/l. The results of the present study show that BAY 12-8039 may be useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Chloramphenicol resistance in Clostridium difficile is encoded on Tn4453 transposons that are closely related to Tn4451 from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The chloramphenicol resistance gene catD from Clostridium difficile was shown to  be encoded on the transposons Tn4453a and Tn4453b, which were structurally and functionally related to Tn4451 from Clostridium perfringens. Tn4453a and Tn4453b excised precisely from recombinant plasmids, generating a circular form, as is the case for Tn4451. Evidence that this process is mediated by Tn4453-encoded tnpX genes was obtained from experiments which showed that in trans these genes complemented a Tn4451tnpX delta 1 mutation for excision. Nucleotide sequencing showed that the joint of the circular form generated by the excision of Tn4453a and Tn4453b was similar to that from Tn4451. These results suggest that the Tn4453-encoded TnpX proteins bind to similar DNA target sequences and function in a manner comparable to that of TnpX from Tn4453. Furthermore, it has been shown that Tn4453a and Tn4453b can be transferred to suitable recipient cells by RP4 and therefore are mobilizable transposons. It is concluded that, like Tn4451, they must encode a functional tnpZ gene and a target oriT or RSA site. The finding that related transposable elements are present in C. difficile and C. perfringens has implications for the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and the mobile elements on which they are found within the clostridia.
TI  - Protease activity of Clostridium difficile strains.
AB  - The production of proteolytic enzymes by 10 Clostridium difficile isolates of varying toxigenicity and clinical origin was studied to determine if all isolates secreted proteases. Different protease substrates were studied: gelatin, collagen, phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-glycyl-L-prolyl-D-arginine (Pz-peptide), casein, azocasein, and azocoll. All isolates degraded gelatin, collagen, and azocoll. The supernatants of all isolates contained an enzyme capable of attacking gelatin incorporated in a polyacrylamide gel (zymograms) and forming two closely spaced lytic bands with an estimated molecular mass of 35-40 kDa. Polyclonal antibodies, produced against the C. difficile gelatinase, revealed in Western blots a 35-kDa protein in the culture supernatants of all C. difficile isolates. In the same manner, Clostridium perfringens collagenase polyclonal antibodies detected a 120-kDa protein in the culture supernatants of all isolates; this suggests that at least two proteases may exist in C. difficile. The protease activities of the 10 strains examined did not seem strikingly different quantitatively but were in general weak and their role in pathogenicity is suspect.
TI  - Regulated transcription of Clostridium difficile toxin genes.
AB  - The Clostridium difficile toxA and toxB genes, encoding cytotoxic and enterotoxic proteins responsible for antibiotic-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis, were shown to be transcribed both from gene-specific promoters and from promoters of upstream genes. However, the gene-specific transcripts represented the majority of tox gene mRNAs. The 5' ends of these mRNAs were shown to correspond to DNA sequences that had promoter activity when fused to the Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase (gusA) gene and introduced into C. perfringens. The appearance of tox mRNA in C. difficile was repressed during exponential growth phase but increased substantially as cells entered stationary phase. When glucose or other rapidly metabolizable sugars were present in the medium, the stationary phase-associated induction was inhibited, indicating that the toxin genes are subject to a form of catabolite repression. This glucose effect was general to many toxinogenic strains having varying levels of toxin production.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of AM-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of AM-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. Although AM-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group and Prevotella bivia (MIC90s > or =3.13 mg/mL), 76% of the B. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at AM-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/L. AM-1155 was highly active against Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens and Mobiluncus spp. (MIC90s < or =0.39 mg/L). An in-vivo study using a mixed infection with AM-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible B. fragilis and Escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. AM-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against E. coli. These results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of AM-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. Clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in AM-1155-treated mice. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of AM-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the B. fragilis group and P. bivia should be evaluated further.
TI  - [Anti-anaerobic activity of carbapenems].
AB  - The critical concentrations of sensitivity and resistance for meropenem versus anaerobic bacterias were analyzed. It is demonstrated the meropenem is a powerful inhibitor of the microorganisms of the Bacteroides groups (MIC90 < 1 mg/l), Prevotella > Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Veillonella, Clostridium perfringens is inhibited at a MIC < 0.06 mg/l. The MIC of meropenem versus C. difficile is 2 mg/l. They are also highly susceptible to the Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Peptococcus type microorganisms. Meropenem is comparable to imipenem and is more active than piperacillin, metronidazole and clindamycin. The mechanism of action and acquisition of resistance versus meropenem is evaluated and discussed. The percentage of highly resistant strains (MIC > 256 mg/l) isolated in the Hospital Gregorio Maranon in Madrid (Spain) is low (1.2%). The influence of pH on the in vitro activity of the carbapenemicos is also analyzed providing experimental data suggesting that meropenem maintains its bactericide activity more effectively in low pH conditions (5.6). Finally, the authors analyze the literature and the evidence reported regarding the use of meropenem in clinical practice, as a treatment of intraabdominal infections with a clinical response of 91%-100% and bacteriologic efficacy of 84%-95%.
TI  - Antibody responses to clostridial infection in humans.
AB  - Serum antibody responses to the major toxins produced by Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium tetani, and Clostridium botulinum have been documented following infection. Effective toxoid vaccines for tetanus and enteritis necroticans due to C. perfringens type C demonstrate the potential of antitoxin responses. Although individual serum and mucosal antibody responses to C. difficile enterotoxin (toxin A) vary, one-third of patients with C. difficile diarrhea develop neutralizing serum antibodies. IgA in the serum, not IgG, is typically responsible for this neutralization, suggesting a unique role for serum IgA in response to C. difficile infection, an infection that is usually limited to the intestinal mucosa. The relationship of naturally occurring antitoxin antibodies to the clinical course of C. difficile infection is controversial. However, patients with chronic relapsing C. difficile diarrhea and low levels of IgG to toxin A have shown clinical responses following intravenous therapy with immune globulin. Antibody responses to non-toxin C. difficile proteins also occur, but their significance is only partially known.
TI  - The effect of enteric bacterial toxins on the catecholamine levels of the rabbit.
AB  - The rabbit catecholamine responses to bacterial toxins commonly found in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) victims were studied as part of a proposed animal model for SIDS. Six bacterial toxins commonly isolated from SIDS baby feces and a comparison endotoxin were injected intravenously (i.v.) and intraluminarily (i.l.) to determine their effects on catecholamine levels. I.v. injected toxins clearly altered catecholamine levels causing sharp rises in adrenaline and noradrenaline levels and at critical toxin concentrations sudden death ensued. Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and alpha-toxin, Clostridium difficile enterotoxin (A) and cytotoxin (B), Escherichia coli STa toxin and staphylococcal enterotoxin B caused rises in catecholamine levels similar to that caused by E. coli endotoxin. Control rabbits showed very little or no obvious change in catecholamine levels. Clostridium difficile enterotoxin (A) and cytotoxin (B) injected i.v. exhibited synergy. Toxins injected into the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and large intestine caused behavioural changes ranging from reduced appetite and diarrhea to, in rare cases, death. Changes in the catecholamine levels of these animals however were not significantly different from those of the control animals. The results are discussed in relation to the possible effect of certain conditions (physiological, viral infections and environmental) which increase toxin permeability and allow absorption of these toxins, possibly resulting in sudden infant death.
TI  - The association of erythromycin ethylsuccinate with acute colitis in horses in Sweden.
AB  - In Sweden there are several reports of mares developing acute colitis while their foals were being treated orally for Rhodococcus equi pneumonia with the combination of erythromycin and rifampicin. In this study 6 adult horses were given low oral dosages of these antibiotics, singly or in combination. Within 3 days post administration of erythromycin, in one case in combination with rifampicin, 2 horses developed severe colitis (one fatal). Clostridium difficile was isolated from one of the horses, whereas no specific pathogens were isolated from the other. Both horses had typical changes in blood parameters seen in acute colitis. Clostridium difficile was also isolated from the faeces of a third horse given an even lower dosage of erythromycin in combination with rifampicin. This horse developed very mild clinical symptoms and recovered spontaneously. In the fourth horse given erythromycin only, very high numbers of Clostridium perfringens were isolated. The horses given rifampicin only did not develop any clinical symptoms and there were no major changes in their faecal flora. In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that low dosages of erythromycin ethylsuccinate can induce severe colitis in horses associated with major changes of the intestinal microflora. Clostridium difficile has been demonstrated as a potential aetiological agent in antibiotic-induced acute colitis.
TI  - The intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  - Bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. In infants delivered by Caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. The first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. Among them, Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from the newborn faecal flora at birth. Facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by Bifidobacterium sp. Clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a Caesarean section. Clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as Bacteroides and other Clostridium sp. The impact of Caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. Feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. In humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. Formula feeding seems to promote implantation and persistence of Clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of C. difficile in newborns.
TI  - Production of a complete binary toxin (actin-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase) by  Clostridium difficile CD196.
AB  - A Clostridium difficile isolate was found to produce an actin-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase (CDT) homologous to the enzymatic components of Clostridium perfringens iota toxin and Clostridium spiroforme toxin (M. R. Popoff, E. J. Rubin, D. M. Gill, and P. Boquet, Infect. Immun. 56:2299-2306, 1988). The CDT locus from C. difficile CD196 was cloned and sequenced. It contained two genes (cdtA and cdtB) which display organizations and sequences similar to those of the iota toxin gene. The deduced enzymatic (CDTa) and binding (CDTb) components have 81 and 84% identity, respectively, with the corresponding components of iota toxin. CDTa and CDTb induced actin cytoskeleton alterations similar to those caused by other clostridial binary toxins. The lower level of production of binary toxin by CD196 than of iota toxin by C. perfringens was related to a lower transcript level, possibly due to a promoter region different from that of iota toxin genes. The cdtA and cdtB genes have been detected in 3 of 24 clinical isolates examined, and cdtB alone was found in 2 additional strains. One strain (in addition to CD196) was shown by Western blotting to produce CDTa and CDTb. These results indicate that some C. difficile strains synthesize a binary toxin that could be an additional virulence factor.
TI  - Transcription analysis of the genes tcdA-E of the pathogenicity locus of Clostridium difficile.
AB  - To analyse the transcription pattern of the five tcdA-E genes of the pathogenicity locus (PaLoc) of Clostridium difficile a protocol was established to purify RNA from strain VPI10463. Transcription analysis of the five tcdA-E genes showed that they were all transcribed. In the early exponential phase, a high level of tcdC and low levels of tcdA,B,D,E transcripts were detectable; this was inverted in the stationary phase, suggesting that TcdC might have a negative influence on transcription of the other genes. Three transcription initiation sites, one for tcdA and two for tcdB were determined by primer extension analysis. Readthrough transcripts from outside the locus were not obtainable, so that parts of the transcription of tcdD, tcdB, tcdA and tcdC must occur by monocistronic transcription. Within the locus all possible intergenic readthrough transcripts were detectable except that between tcdC and tcdA, a stretch of DNA interrupted by a functional transcription terminator. Thus we found mono- and polycistronic transcription of tcdA and tcdB to occur which should lead to production of a surplus of tcdA over tcdB transcripts. This would explain the surplus of TcdA over TcdB expression observed in vitro. Due to its basic nature and similarity to BcnA of Clostridium perfringens and to Orf-22 of Clostridium botulinum, TcdD is most probably a regulatory protein with DNA-binding properties. On the basis of the presented study we discuss a model for the growth-phase-related, coordinate regulation of toxin expression wherein tcdC has a negative and tcdD a positive regulatory function on transcription of the tcdD,B,E and tcdA genes.
TI  - [Anaerobic bacteria as the cause of endogenous infections].
AB  - Most mucocutaneous surfaces of humans harbor a rich indigenous microbial flora with predominance of anaerobes. Anaerobic infections are usually endogenous indicating that they originate from the host's own flora. Important exceptions are botulism, tetanus, food poisoning by Clostridium perfringens, some cases of gas gangrene and cases of hospital-acquired C. difficile-induced diarrhea. Endogenous anaerobic infections often occur in adjacent to the mucosal surfaces. Other organs are infected by penetration or hematogenous spread. A predisposing condition to anaerobic infections is a low redox potential resulting from tissue destruction, foreign bodies, malignancy or vascular insufficiency. A mixed anaerobic-aerobic infection is often found in abscesses or tissue necrosis. Antimicrobial therapy must take into account that anaerobic infections are often associated with aerobic bacteria.
TI  - Intracellular transport and processing of protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial toxins are associated with disease in humans and animals. Toxins can either be preformed in food or produced by bacteria in the intestine. There are two types of toxins: heat-labile protein toxins and heat stabile toxins. Heat labile toxins are produced by Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholerae, and heat-stabile enterotoxins consisting of relatively few amino acids are produced by Escherichia coli and acts by activation of guanylate cyclase. Similarly, heat-stabile entero-toxins are also produced by Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of food poisoning in the United States, and Yersenia enterocolitica. Protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria can intoxicate intestinal cells and can also be taken up from the gut and reach other cells in the body. For example the Shiga-like toxins (vero-toxins) can intoxicate endothelial cells in the kidney and cause kidney failure. Intracellular transport and processing of a few of the protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria, namely Clostridium difficile toxin A and B, cholera toxin and the related heat-labile toxin produced by Escherichia coli, and Shiga toxin and Shiga-like toxins are presented.
TI  - Effect of lactulose on short-chain fatty acids and lactate production and on the  growth of faecal flora, with special reference to Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Lactulose exerts a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy by decreasing toxic short-chain (iC4-nC6) fatty acid (isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate, valerate, isocaproate and caproate) production. However, the precise mechanism by which lactulose exerts this effect remains uncertain. This study investigated the effect of lactulose on faecal flora, particularly Clostridium difficile, which produces mostly iC4-nC6 fatty acids. An in-vitro faecal incubation system was used to estimate how lactulose influences production of short-chain (C2-nC6) fatty acids and lactate. Faecal specimens were collected from patients with liver cirrhosis, who carried C. difficile in the colon. Supplementation of lactulose along with blood in faecal specimens decreased iC4-nC6 fatty acids production and increased acetate and lactate production, resulting in increased faecal acidity. These changes were statistically significant when compared with supplementation by blood alone. Quantitative faecal culture demonstrated that lactulose supplementation suppressed the growth of C. difficile and Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group), iC4-nC6 fatty acids-producing organisms. These results suggest that decreased faecal levels of iC4-nC6 fatty acids after lactulose supplementation may be related to suppression of iC4-nC6 fatty acids-producing faecal organisms, especially C. difficile.
TI  - Incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  - Rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  More than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. Clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for C. difficile enterotoxin. However, 27 cefmetazole-induced diarrheic cases were not associated with C. difficile. Other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as Campylobacter spp., Bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. However, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. This was ascribed to the overgrowth of Clostridium innocuum and Clostridium sporogenes. There were no remarkable differences in changes in other bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinolones and other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic  bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and DU-6859a against peptostreptococci, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium were determined by an agar dilution method. These activities were compared with those of piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, and metronidazole. Imipenem, metronidazole, and DU-6859a were the most active antimicrobial agents that were tested. The in vitro activity of DU-6859a was superior to those of ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, and sparfloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem compared to nine other antimicrobial agents: importance of its stability when used in agar dilution systems.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem was tested against 426 clinical isolates  representing a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic species. The in vitro activity of meropenem was compared with that of iminpenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and tobramycin against aerobic isolates, and also compared with that of imipenem, metronidazole, cefoxitin, clindamycin and piperacillin against the anaerobic isolates. Meropenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against Gram negative aerobes, anaerobes, Gram positive anaerobes and most of the Gram positive aerobes. The MIC90 of meropenem against the Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.03 mg/l to 0.125 mg/l. Meropenem was very active against extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, most Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium difficile (MIC90 of 1.0 mg/l), Clostridium perfringens and other Clostridium species. Even though imipenem exhibited better activity against the coagulase negative staphylococci, meropenem still had MIC's which were less than the break point (8.0 mg/l). The stability of meropenem in agar was determined indirectly by plotting the geometric mean MIC of control strains over a period of two weeks. Mean MIC of six control strains for meropenem was 0.05 mg/l and remained constant over 10 days, whereas the mean MIC of imipenem rose to 0.24 mg/l after two days and to 3.4 mg/l after 10 days. Meropenem was therefore far more stable in agar than imipenem. This has implications for laboratories using agar dilution as it requires less frequent plate preparation and decreased labour costs.
TI  - Genetic organization and distribution of tetracycline resistance determinants in  Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The Tet P determinant from the conjugative Clostridium perfringens R plasmid pCW3 two functional overlapping tetracycline resistance genes, tetA(P) and tetB(P). The tetA(P) gene encodes a putative 46-kDa transmembrane protein which mediates active efflux of tetracycline from the cell, while tetB(P) encodes a putative 72.6-kDa protein which has significant similarity to Tet M-like tetracycline resistance proteins (J. Sloan, L.M. McMurry, D. Lyras, S. B. Levy, and J. I. Rood, Mol. Microbiol. 11:403-415, 1994). In the present study, hybridization and PCR analysis of 81 tetracycline-resistant isolates of C. perfringens showed that they all carried the tetA(P) gene. Most of these isolates (93%) carried a second tetracycline resistance gene, with 53% carrying tetB(P) and 40% carrying a tet(M)-like gene. Despite the wide distribution of the tetB(P) and tet(M) genes, no isolate which carried both of these determinants was detected. In isolates that carried both tetA(P) and tetB(P) these genes overlapped, as in pCW3. Isolates carrying this combination of genes originated from diverse geographical locations and environmental sources. The single Clostridium paraputrificum isolate examined carried tetA(P), indicating that this gene is not confined to C.perfringens. However, neither tetA(P) nor tetB(P) was detected in the nine Clostridium difficile isolates tested. Nucleotide sequence analysis of isolates lacking tetB(P) revealed that they contained the tetA408(P) gene, which lacked the codons for the 12 carboxy-terminal amino acids of the TetA(P) protein.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of activities of nitazoxanide and tizoxanide against anaerobes and aerobic organisms.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of nitazoxanide and its main metabolite, tizoxanide, were tested against a broad range of bacteria, including anaerobes. Metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, and clindamycin were used as positive controls. MICs were determined by reference agar dilution methods. The 241 anaerobes were all inhibited by nitazoxanide, with the MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC90S) being between 0.06 and 4 mg/liter with the exception of those for Propionibacterium species, for which the MIC90 was 16 mg/liter. The MIC90s of nitazoxanide were 0.5 mg/liter for the Bacteroides fragilis group (80 strains), 0.06 mg/liter for Clostridium difficile (21 strains), and 0.5 mg/liter for Clostridium perfringens (16 strains). Metronidazole showed a level of activity comparable to that of nitazoxanide except against Bifidobacterium species, against which it was poorly active, and Propionibacterium species, which were resistant to metronidazole. The other antibiotics showed various levels of activity against anaerobes, with imipenem along with nitazoxanide being the most active agents tested. Tizoxanide was less effective than nitazoxanide except against the B. fragilis group, against which its activity was similar to that of nitazoxanide. Under aerobic conditions, nitazoxanide demonstrated poor activity against members of the family Enterobacteriacae and Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus species. The same results were obtained when culture was performed under anaerobic conditions with the notable exception of the results against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of nitazoxanide were in the range of 2 to 4 mg/liter for 34 clinical isolates of S. aureus, 12 of which were methicillin resistant, while tizoxanide was not effective.
TI  - Genetic characterisation of the botulinum toxin complex of Clostridium botulinum  strain NCTC 2916.
AB  - An 8 kb segment of the Clostridium botulinum NCTC 2916 genome 5' to the type A botulinum neurotoxin gene has been sequenced revealing five open reading frames. Four encode components (HA70, HA17, HA34 and NTNH/A) of the progenitor toxin complex. The product of the fifth, OrfX, possesses a putative C-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, exhibits homology with known regulatory proteins (including MsmR from Streptococcus mutans, UviA from C. perfringens and Orftxe1 located upstream of the C. difficile toxin B gene) and is also found within the vicinity of genes encoding tetanus toxin and types B, C, D and G botulinum toxins. Primer extension and Northern blotting analysis demonstrates that the genes are expressed as two divergent operons [HA34, HA17, HA70] and [NTNH/A, type A toxin gene], with the OrfX gene expressed singly. Immediately adjacent to the transcriptional start sites of the HA34 and NTNH/A genes are two highly conserved motifs (5'-ATTTTagGTTTACAAAA-3' and 5'-ATGTTATATgTaA-3'), separated by 12 bp, that span the putative -35 and -10 promoter regions. Homologous sequences occur in the equivalent position relative to the genes at type C botulinum toxin gene and the tetanus toxin gene loci. It is likely that these sequence motifs, together with OrfX, are involved in the co-ordinate expression of the genes encoding the various components of the botulinum toxin complex in groups I, III and IV C. botulinum strains and in that of the tetanus toxin gene.
TI  - [In vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, marbofloxacin (RO 09-1168) against strictly anaerobic bacteria and some bacteria from human fecal flora].
AB  - As recommended by the EEC, the in vitro activity of a veterinary quinolone has to be evaluated on human strains isolated from the gut and especially against anaerobes. Thus, the MICs for Marbofloxacin were determined by the reference agar method (Norma NCCLS M11 A3) using Wilkins Chalgren medium for the 124 anaerobic strains and Mueller Hinton agar for E. coli, Proteus, Enterococcus and Lactobacillus. On the whole aerobes, the activity of Marbofloxacin was equal or slightly greater to that of ofloxacin. The modal MIC was 0.03 mg/l for Enterobacteriaceae, 2 mg/l and 16 mg/l for Enterococcus and Lactobacillus strains, respectively. Considering the anti-anaerobic activity of this new drug, in comparison with that of ofloxacin, MICs for ofloxacin were generally one log2 higher for Gram negative bacilli and two log2 higher for Gram positive bacilli. Modal MICs for marbofloxacin were 0.12 mg/l for Clostridium perfringens, 0.5 mg/l for Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus strains, 1 mg/l for Bifidobacteria, 2 mg/l for non-fragilis members of the B. fragilis group, and 4 mg/l for C. difficile strains, respectively. It appears in vitro that Marbofloxacin was a more potent agent than ofloxacin on the whole anaerobes.
TI  - Nested polymerase chain reaction for detection of low levels of enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens in animal feces and meat.
AB  - A rapid and sensitive method for detecting enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens in animal feces and meat is described. The method consists of a combination of nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with enrichment culture of the sample. In the PCR, two pairs of oligonucleotide primers homologous to the C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) gene were used: the first primer pair amplified a 425-bp fragment and the second one amplified a 199-bp fragment within the fragment amplified by the first PCR. When the specificity and sensitivity of nested PCR in the detection of the CPE gene of isolated C. perfringens were compared with those of the single PCR, the former amplified specifically the 199-bp fragment and the sensitivity was about 10(3)-fold higher that that of the latter. The nested PCR combined with enrichment culture was applied to detecting the CPE gene in samples inoculated artificially with enterotoxigenic C. perfringens. This method detected within 22-26 hr the CPE gene in samples of animal feces and meat inoculated with fewer than 10(1) CFU/g of enterotoxigenic C. perfringens. When the method was applied to detection of indigenous enterotoxigenic C. perfringens in cattle feces, pig feces, beef and pork, C. perfringens was found in one case (10%) of 10 cattle fecal samples, and the PCR-amplified product corresponded to the fragment of the CPE gene in restriction endonucleases digestion pattern.
TI  - Fibronectin and laminin binding of eighteen Clostridium species.
AB  - The ability of Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium sporogenes and fifteen other Clostridium species to bind to human serum fibronectin or laminin was tested by using protein-coated latex particles. Three groups of Clostridium species were formed, namely the pseudomembranous colitis-causing species Clostridium difficile, the gas gangrene-causing Clostridium species and other Clostridium species, which are infrequently found in human infections. Significantly more strains of gas gangrene-causing Clostridium species, and strains of Clostridium species other than Clostridium difficile recognized fibronectin or laminin than did Clostridium difficile. Experiments with monoclonal antibodies revealed the specificity of the bacterial binding to fibronectin or laminin.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin-resistant cell line: evidence for possible involvement of the cellular C2II receptor in growth regulation.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, which consists of the binding component C2II and  the enzyme component C2I, acts on eukaryotic cells by selective ADP-ribosylation of G-actin. To obtain C2 toxin-resistant cells, we mutagenized CHO-K1 cells with N-nitroso-N-methylurea and selected for C2 resistance. Cells which survived the selection procedure with 50 ng of C2I and 100 ng of C2II per ml were obtained with a frequency of 30 x 10(-6). The colony-forming ability of CHO wild-type cells was reduced to 50% with 10 ng of C2I and 20 ng of C2II per ml. In contrast, the colony-forming ability of the isolated CHO mutant cells was not influenced by up to 200 ng of C2I and 400 ng of C2II per ml. Toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation of G-actin was not impaired in lysates of mutant cells. The C2 toxin-resistant phenotype remained sensitive to the cell-rounding activities of cytotoxins from C. perfringens (iota-toxin), C. novyi, C. difficile, and C. botulinum (C3) and to cytochalasin D. Binding of component C2II was impaired in resistant CHO cells, suggesting mutation of the toxin cell surface receptor. Serum factors protected wild-type cells against the cytotoxic effect of C2 toxin. Furthermore, the C2-resistant phenotype correlated with an increased serum dependency. The data suggest that the action of C. botulinum C2 toxin is mediated by its binding and uptake via a cell surface receptor which might be involved in growth regulation.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY y 3118, and nine other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of BAY y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone, was determined against 257 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activities of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, and ornidazole. Overall, BAY y 3118 was the most active agent tested against the Bacteroides fragilis group. Its activity (MIC90, 0.5 mg/L) was 16-fold lower than that of sparfloxacin (MIC90, 8 mg/L), and more than 100-fold lower than that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 64 mg/L) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 128 mg/L) against the group. No strains belonging to this group were resistant to metronidazole (MICs range, 0.12-2 mg/L) and ornidazole (MICs range, 0.12-4 mg/L). BAY y 3118 was more active than those quinolones against Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., Fusobacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens and C. difficile (MIC90, 0.12, 0.06, 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively). The activity of BAY y 3118 against Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 1 mg/L) was slightly lower than that of the other Gram-positive bacteria tested. In general, BAY y 3118 was more active than cefoxitin, and it was superior to antianaerobic chemical agents like metronidazole, ornidazole and clindamycin. Pharmacokinetic and clinical trials are required to define the role of BAY y 3118 in the treatment of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Clostridial disease of the gut.
AB  - Clostridia are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. Some of the most common clostridial infections are those of the gut. The primary infections in humans are Clostridium perfringens food poisoning and Clostridium difficile-mediated antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. Less common but important infections include non-food poisoning C. perfringens nosocomial diarrhea and C. perfringens type C necrotizing jejunitis (pig-bel). C. perfringens is also the dominant cause of gastrointestinal infections in animals, although Clostridium septicum causing braxy in sheep, Clostridium colinum causing ulcerative enteritis is avian species, and Clostridium spiroforme causing enterotoxemia in rabbits are important exceptions.
TI  - Is cardiorespiratory failure induced by bacterial toxins the cause of sudden infant death syndrome? Studies with an animal model (the rabbit).
AB  - Recent studies have implicated various toxigenic bacteria and their toxins in the aetiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Therefore the effect of six bacterial toxins on the cardiorespiratory system of the rabbit was studied as a model for SIDS. The toxins' effect on the heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and breathing of anaesthetized rabbits was determined and their action compared to that of endotoxin. Intravenous injection of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and alpha-toxin, Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, Escherichia coli heat-stable toxin (STa), Clostridium difficile toxin A and B reduced heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and increased, slowed and prolonged thorax expansion, and at higher concentrations caused sudden death without visible stress or trauma. A combination of a low concentration of enterotoxins caused a greater reduction of these activities and sudden death. These effects were generally similar to those produced by endotoxin. In non-anaesthetized rabbits, the toxins slowed metabolism until death occurred without agitation, spasms, visible distress or prolonged illness. Intestinal production of these toxins by toxigenic strains, when conditions are suitable, and their systemic absorption, could therefore cause SIDS by an endotoxin-like shock mechanism.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of C.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  - The synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the Clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. A vector free digoxigenin-dUTP-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cloned plc gene of C.perfringens strain ATCC 13124. In a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of C.perfringens were tested for plc. None of the strains failed in hybridization. Presence of plc was even demonstrated in C.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. Specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. None different Clostridia sp. tested, e.g. C.bifermentans, C.tertium, C.novyi, C.chauvoei, C.sporogenes, C.difficile, C.putrifucum, C.sordellii, C.botulinum, C. septicum and C.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. Strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. Comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with DNA hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of C.perfringens plc.
TI  - Antibiotic-induced diarrhea.
AB  - Diarrhea is a common complication of antibiotic therapy and can range from mild soiling of a cast to severe and life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis. Although clindamycin is the most notorious, almost all antibiotics, particularly penicillins and cephalosporins, may also be responsible (Bartlett, 1992; Kelly, Pothoulakis, & LaMont, 1994). Because of the frequent use of these antibiotics in orthopaedic patients, antibiotic-associated enteric disease is a common problem in this population. About 15% to 25% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea are caused by Clostridium difficile (Bartlett, 1992; George, 1984; Kelly et al., 1994). The majority of patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea have no identifiable etiologic agent. Salmonella, enterotoxin-producing Clostridium perfringens (Borriello et al., 1984) and Candida albicans (Danna et al., 1991) have rarely been identified as causative agents. This article describes the role of C. difficile as an enteric pathogen and its spectrum of clinical disease, including diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosocomial transmission.
TI  - Clostridial infection in children.
AB  - A survey of the isolation of Clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. The isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified Clostridium spp., 37 (33%) C. perfringens, 13 (12%) C. ramosum, five (4%) C. innocuum, six (5%) C. botulinum, three (3%) C. difficile, two (2%) C. butyricum, and one isolate each of C. bifermentans, C. clostridiiforme, C. limosum and C. paraputrificum. Most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). Predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. These were immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). The clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. The species most commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group) (50), Escherichia coli (22), pigmented Prevotella or Porphyromonas spp. (18) and Fusobacterium spp. (10). Most Bacteroides and Escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck sites. Antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). Only two patients died. These data illustrate the importance of Clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.
TI  - Differentiation of Clostridium difficile, Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium sordellii, and Clostridium perfringens from diarrheal stool by API ZYM and API LRA oxidase test.
AB  - A simple, rapid and reliable outline for identification of clostridia isolates from human infections was developed. It consists of a combination of API ZYM and API LRA Oxidase tests. The enzymatic activities were performed with strains sub-cultured onto carbohydrate-free medium (Columbia blood agar). Fifty-five strains of Clostridium difficile, C. bifermentans, C. sordellii, and C. perfringens from clinical specimens and eight reference standard strains representing different species of the same genus were analyzed. The accuracy of the new method was evaluated by comparison with the results obtained by DNA/DNA analysis.
TI  - [Presence of Campylobacter spp., Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens and salmonellae in litters of puppies and in adult dogs in a shelter].
AB  - In order to ascertain the importance of Campylobacter spp., C.difficile, C.perfringens and Salmonella as agents of bacterial gastroenteritis in dogs, two groups of animals were studied prospectively. The first group consisted of 77 puppies in 14 litters, with fecal cultures performed weekly for 10 weeks, starting at birth. The second group consisted of a kennel population with every dog cultured at entry, and at two-month intervals thereafter. Incidence of Campylobacter spp. was 32 and 31 per 100 dog-month of observation for healthy pups and healthy adult dogs respectively, 46 and 0 for C.difficile, 51 and 36 for C.perfringens and 6.5 and 1.3 for Salmonella. The incidence of Campylobacter spp. in pups peaked at 8 weeks of age. This incidence (43 per 100 dog-months) was higher in pups reared together with older dogs than in pups reared without contact to other dogs (0 per 100 dog-months). Toxigenic strains of C.difficile were found in 61.5% of the healthy neonate dogs. None of the cases of non-watery and non-inflammatory diarrhea we observed was associated with any of the pathogens studied. Furthermore newly acquired colonization with Campylobacter spp. or Salmonella was never associated with episodes of diarrhea. No conclusions could be drawn about the role of bacterial pathogens for causation of watery or inflammatory diarrhea which were not observed in our study.
TI  - In vitro activity of DU-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of a new quinolone agent, DU-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-approved Wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of DU-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin, metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. DU-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every group of organisms. MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis (57), other B. fragilis group species (84), Bilophila wadsworthia (15), Clostridium species (27) (including C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum), Fusobacterium nucleatum (16), Fusobacterium mortiferum-F. varium group species (10), Peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and Prevotella species (25).
TI  - Toxin-related diarrheas.
AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ICI 194660, CAS 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. They included Bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), Prevotella bivia (n = 11), Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), Clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated species and genera, e.g. Selenomonas sputigena and Clostridium symbiosum. Bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, Clostridium species, including C. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. Meropenem was especially active against Bacteroides gracilis (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml), Prevotella disiens (MIC90 0.03 microgram/ml), Fusobacterium nucleatum (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml), Clostridium perfringens (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml) and Veillonella parvula (MIC90 0.03 microgram/ml). The results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.
TI  - Two-year study of endemic enteric pathogens associated with acute diarrhea in New Caledonia.
AB  - A longitudinal study of diarrheal disease among patients of all ages with acute diarrhea was carried out in New Caledonia from January 1990 to December 1991. Stool samples from 2,088 diarrheal patients were examined for parasites, rotavirus, and bacterial pathogens. Potential sources of contamination (drinking water, seawater and bovine and porcine feces) were investigated. One or more enteric pathogens were identified in 41.8 and 40.6% of the persons with diarrhea, in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., HEp-2 cell adherent Escherichia coli (diffuse adherent and enteroaggregative), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (EPEC adherence factor-positive strains belonging to classical serotypes), localized adherent E. coli (non-EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli were the frequently identified enteropathogenic bacteria. Other major enteropathogens were Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia. Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia enterocolitica, and rotavirus were isolated from only a few patients. No Vibrio spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Shiga-like-toxin-producing E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, or enteroinvasive E. coli were identified. Shiga-like toxin I-producing E. coli were present in adult bovines and calves, and heat-stable enterotoxin II-producing enterotoxigenic E. coli were found in pigs.
TI  - Genetic basis for antibiotic resistance in anaerobes.
AB  - This review focuses on genetic and molecular data regarding antibiotic resistance in anaerobes, particularly Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides species, and Prevotella species. The determinants of resistance are frequently transferable through a conjugation-like process; plasmid self-transfer, plasmid mobilization, or (in Bacteroides species) chromosomal conjugative elements can be involved. The determinants can be localized on transposons. At the genetic level, resistance determinants can be highly specific for one or several anaerobes or may exhibit homology with genes from aerobes. The latter observation suggests that anaerobes are able to exchange genetic material from a "gene pool" shared with aerobic organisms.
TI  - Characterization of six murine monoclonal antibodies specific for toxin B of Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Six murine hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Toxin B of Clostridium difficile have been generated from toxin-immunized female RBF/DnJ mice. All six antibodies were reactive in Western blots with a > 200-kD protein in the supernatants of the toxigenic strain 10463 and were unreactive with similarly prepared material from the nontoxigenic strain 2037. Polyclonal antisera from rabbits immunized with Toxin B reacted on Western blots primarily with Toxin B, a 40-kD and a 55-kD band with a minor set of triplet bands at approximately 100 kD. None of the MAbs reacted in a direct EIA with purified Toxin A from C. difficile but two MAbs reacted weakly with a trypsin-sensitive band (> 200 kD) in Western blots of C. sordellii. Polyclonal antisera developed against Toxin B reacted strongly with supernatants from C. sordellii, C. bifermentans, and the nontoxigenic strain 2037. Toxin B-specific antisera was unreactive with supernatants from C. perfringens or purified Toxin A from C. difficile in direct EIA. Toxin B-specific MAbs linked to an affinity column were able to deplete bacterial supernatant of cytotoxigenic activity.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens in stool, intrapartum antibiotics and gastrointestinal signs in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - In 1989, we observed in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), an increased number of infants with gastrointestinal signs, including five cases of necrotizing enterocolitis. Clostridium perfringens was found in 26% of newborns (n = 168) and was associated significantly with the occurrence of flatulence, distended abdomen, foul-smelling stools, diarrhea and blood in stool (all p < 0.001). C. difficile was found in 17% of the newborns (n = 72). Cesarean section, low gestational age and low birth weight were significantly associated with C. perfringens in stools (all p < 0.001). Treatment with antibiotics was not associated with occurrence of C. perfringens. However, in infants with C. perfringens, intrapartum antibiotics were associated with increased appearance of abdominal distension (p < 0.05). Thus the antibiotics, which disturb primary colonization, may also favor the pathogenic role of opportunistic gut bacteria, such as C. perfringens.
TI  - Growth inhibition of Clostridium difficile by intestinal flora of infant faeces in continuous flow culture.
AB  - Growth of Clostridium difficile was inhibited more strongly in continuous flow (CF) culture with C. difficile-negative faeces of infants than with C. difficile-positive faeces. Culture of faecal flora of infants yielded a greater variety of bacterial species in C. difficile-negative than in C. difficile-positive faeces. In the mixed CF culture of C. difficile with Enterococcus avium, Bacteroides distasonis, Eubacterium lentum, C. ramosum, C. perfringens and either Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from C. difficile-negative faeces, inhibition of growth of C. difficile was demonstrated when the pH of the culture medium was decreased. Amino-acid analysis of CF cultures showed considerable utilisation of aspartic acid, serine, threonine, arginine and asparagine. A marked increase in concentrations of citrulline and ornithine was found in the culture that inhibited growth of C. difficile. The addition of citrulline and ornithine into a Gifu anaerobic medium (GAM) broth produced no inhibition of growth of C. difficile. The addition of the mixture of the depleted amino acids (aspartic acid, serine, threonine, arginine and asparagine) to the culture filtrate or adjustment of the pH of the culture filtrate induced considerable growth of C. difficile. These results suggest that the inhibition of growth of C. difficile may be due to consumption of amino acids by intestinal flora, and not to the presence of inhibitors produced by the intestinal flora.
TI  - In vitro activity of DMG-Mino and DMG-DM Dot, two new glycylcyclines, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of DMG-Mino and DMG-DM Dot against 350 anaerobic bacterial  strains including anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species and fusobacteria was determined by the agar dilution method. Their activity was compared with that of minocycline, doxycycline, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. DMG-Mino and DMG-DM Dot and imipenem were the most active agents tested. DMG-Mino and DMG-DM Dot had in vitro activity superior to that of minocycline and doxycycline.
TI  - Trypsin-dependent production of an antibacterial substance by a human Peptostreptococcus strain in gnotobiotic rats and in vitro.
AB  - An antibacterial substance appeared within 1 day in feces of gnotobiotic rats harboring a human intestinal Peptostreptococcus strain. It disappeared when the rat bile-pancreatic duct was ligatured or when the rats ingested a trypsin inhibitor. Anaerobic cultures of the Peptostreptococcus strain in a medium supplemented with trypsin also exhibited an antibacterial activity, which was also inhibited by the trypsin inhibitor. In vitro the antibacterial substance from both feces and culture medium was active against several gram-positive bacteria, including other Peptostreptococcus spp., potentially pathogenic Clostridium spp. such as C. perfringens, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. septicum, and C. sordellii, Eubacterium spp., Bifidobacterium spp., and Bacillus spp. Whatever the order of inoculation of the strains, a sensitive strain of C. perfringens was eliminated within 1 day from the intestine of rats monoassociated with the Peptostreptococcus strain. These findings demonstrate for the first time that very potent antibacterial substances can be produced through a mechanism involving intestinal bacteria and exocrine pancreatic secretions.
TI  - Clostridia-associated enterocolitis in adult horses and foals.
AB  - A review of the literature describing clostridia-associated enterocolitis is presented. The bacteria, their toxins, and possible factors that interact to contribute to the pathogenesis of enterocolitis are described. Clinical signs associated with clostridia-associated enterocolitis, methods of diagnosis, treatments, and preventive strategies are discussed.
TI  - Enterotoxigenic bacteria in the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Faecal samples from 123 infants who died with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and from a comparative group of 52 age-matched babies were analysed for toxigenic bacteria and their toxins. Serum samples from the SIDS infants were also analysed for these toxins. A significantly higher proportion of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins were found in faecal samples of SIDS babies than in samples from the comparative group. These toxins were also found in serum from the SIDS babies. Clostridium perfringens was found in 54 (45.4%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 10 (19.6%) of 51 healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.1, p < 0.01); C. difficile in 33 (27.7%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 8 (14.8%) of 54 healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.43ns, p < 0.1); Staphylococcus aureus in 12 (27.3%; 66.7% enterotoxigenic) of 44 SIDS cases compared with 12 (85.7%; non-enterotoxigenic) of 14 healthy babies (chi 2 = 14.9, p < 0.001); C. botulinum in 6 (5.0%) of 120 SIDS cases compared with 0 of 53 healthy babies (chi 2 = 2.74, p < 0.1). Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonellae and Bacillus cereus were not detected. Heat-labile toxin, lethal to mice (HLML) was found in 32 (27.1%) of 118 SIDS faecal samples compared with 5 (10.6%) of 47 healthy babies (chi 2 = 5.24, p < 0.05); cytotoxins in 38 (30.9%) of 123 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 21 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 8.8, p < 0.01) and 24 (27.6%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 33 (34.4%) of 96 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 23 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.94, p < 0.001), and in 27 (24.5%) of 110 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens alpha-toxin (presumptive) was detected in 14 (17.5%) of 80 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 17 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.5ns, p congruent to 0.05) and in 2 (2.3%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. difficile toxin was detected in four SIDS faecal samples and two serum samples. C. botulinum toxin was detected in only one of 120 SIDS faecal samples compared with none of 49 from healthy babies. Staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected in 8 (19.5%) of 41 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 19 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 4.278, p < 0.05), and in 4 (10.8%) of 37 SIDS serum samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of the new quinolone BAY y 3118 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY y 3118 against anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by an agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. BAY y 3118, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole were the most active agents tested. The in vitro activity of BAY y 3118 against anaerobic bacteria was superior to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
TI  - Susceptibilities of 428 gram-positive and -negative anaerobic bacteria to Bay y3118 compared with their susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and cefoxitin.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 428 gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes (including  selected cefoxitin-resistant strains) to Bay y3118 (a new fluoroquinolone), ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and piperacillin-tazobactam were tested. Organisms comprised 115 Bacteroides fragilis group, 116 non-B. fragilis Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp., 40 fusobacteria, 58 peptostreptococci, 48 gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, and 51 clostridia. beta-Lactamase production was demonstrated in 87% of the gram-negative rods but in none of the gram-positive organisms. Overall, Bay y3118 was the most active agent, with all organisms inhibited at an MIC of < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml (MICs for 50% [MIC50] and 90% [MIC90] of strains tested, 0.125 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively). By contrast, ciprofloxacin was much less active, with only 42% of strains susceptible at a breakpoint of 2.0 micrograms/ml (MIC50, 4.0 micrograms/ml; MIC90, 16.0 micrograms/ml). Metronidazole was active against all gram-negative rods, but 7% of peptostreptococci, 83% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, and 4% of non-Clostridium perfringens, non-Clostridium difficile clostridia were resistant to this agent (MICs, > 16.0 micrograms/ml). Clindamycin was active against 94% of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp., 91% of peptostreptococci, and 100% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, but was active against only 70% of fusobacteria and 53% of clostridia. Cefoxitin was active against > or = 90% of all groups except the B. fragilis group and non-Propionibacterium acnes gram-positive non-spore-forming rods (both 85%) and C. difficile (20%). Significant enhancement of piperacillin by tazobactam was seen in all beta-lactamase-positive strains (99% susceptible; MIC90, 8.0 micrograms/ml), and all beta-lactamase-negative strains were susceptible to piperacillin (MIC90, 8.0 micrograms/ml). Clinical studies are required to delineate the role of Bay y3118 in the treatment of anaerobic infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of L-627 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of L-627 against 370 anaerobic bacterial strains including  anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by the agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. L-627, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol were the most active agents tested. L-627 had in vitro activity similar to that of the other carbapenems tested.
TI  - Use of bacitracin in the prevention and treatment of experimentally-induced idiopathic colitis in horses.
AB  - Ten healthy ponies from a single herd were found by repeated fecal culture to be  free of Salmonella species and Clostridium cadaveris. In a preliminary study, four ponies administered a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg lincomycin did not develop idiopathic colitis when the drug was administered alone. Four other ponies were administered 10 mg/kg lincomycin by stomach tube together with 0.45 L of colonic content from a horse with idiopathic colitis induced earlier by lincomycin alone. Two of the four ponies were treated with 25 g oral zinc bacitracin premix (110 g/kg active ingredient) 24 h later. Forty-two hours after inoculation the two untreated ponies had severe signs of idiopathic colitis and were euthanized. Postmortem findings were typical of idiopathic colitis. The two treated ponies had milder illness but the more severely affected was also euthanized; the other was retreated at 42 h with bacitracin pre-mix and again 12 h later. Its illness and diarrhea resolved over the next 24 h. Clostridium cadaveris was isolated in large numbers from the cecum of the euthanized ponies and their cecal content contained mouse lethal and guinea pig dermonecrotic, but not cytotoxic, activity. Enterotoxins of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile could not be demonstrated. No toxin could be demonstrated in culture supernatants of C. cadaveris or in supernatants of cecal contents treated with ethanol prior to culturing in anaerobically incubated broth. No Salmonella spp. were isolated. A further two ponies were administered 10 mg/kg lincomycin orally with 0.45 L colonic content from a horse with idiopathic colitis, as described.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Influence of radiotherapy on intestinal microflora in cancer patients.
AB  - We investigated in 15 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix or endometrium, who were undergoing postoperative radiation therapy, the effects of different fractionated radiation exposures on counts of fecal bacteria, on the growth of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin production. We observed a generally significant decrease in intestinal microflora after the first radiation exposure, whereas at the end of radiotherapy all bacteria increased and reached basal values except Enterococcus faecium 1, lactobacilli and total anaerobes. In some patients we observed an overgrowth of some Clostridium spp. which were potential pathogens associated with clinical symptoms. We did not observe an influence of multiple radiations on C. perfringens enterotoxin fecal contents. We conclude that patients receiving radiotherapy may benefit from the intake of oral bacteriotherapy, i.e. live beneficial bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis at the beginning of the irradiation exposure.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to tosufloxacin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tosufloxacin against anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium  acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by the agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. Tosufloxacin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol were the most active agents tested. Tosufloxacin has an antibacterial activity that warrants investigation in clinical trials.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the lethal toxin (alpha-toxin) of Clostridium septicum.
AB  - Clostridium septicum lethal (alpha-toxin) was purified and found to be a basic protein (pI 8.4) of approximately 48 kDa that is both lethal and hemolytic. The alpha-toxin had a hemolytic activity of approximately 2 x 10(7) hemolytic units per mg and a 50% lethal dose of approximately 10 micrograms/kg of body weight for mice. The alpha-toxin formed concentration-dependent, sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant aggregates of approximately 230 kDa. Mice immunized with alpha-toxin showed a significant increase in survival time over mock-immunized mice when challenged with C. septicum. Rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against the purified toxin and was used to confirm that toxin with the same molecular weight was present in seven different C. septicum isolates. No proteins in the supernatants from cultures of Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium histolyticum, Clostridium chauvoei, or Clostridium difficile were found to react with the C. septicum alpha-toxin-specific antibody.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to PD 131628.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 131628 against anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by the agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. PD 131628, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol were the most active agents tested.
TI  - Isolation of a fibroblast mutant resistant to Clostridium difficile toxins A and  B.
AB  - A mutant of Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (Don cells), resistant against Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, was isolated after mutagenization with ethylmethanesulphonate and a two-step selection with toxin B. The mutant, termed CdtR-Q, was 10(4) times more resistant to toxin B than wild-type cells and cross-resistant to toxin A (10(3) times more resistant). The resistance was overcome by increasing the dose of toxin. The resistance has been stable after cultivation for 40 generations in the absence of toxin. The morphology of the mutant was more epithelial-like than that of the fibroblast parental cells. The plating efficiency was about half that of the wild-type, whereas the growth rate was the same. The mutant was significantly less sensitive than the wild-type to the microfilament-interacting cytochalasins B and D. It was as sensitive as the wild-type to endocytosed toxins (diphtheria, pertussis, ricin), to microtubule-interacting agents (colchicine, gossypol, nocodazole, taxol, vinblastine), and to membrane-damaging toxins with different mechanisms of action, with one exception; the mutant was more highly sensitive to the action of phospholipase C (with broad substrate-specificity) than the wild-type. The results suggest that the mutant has a normal endocytosis, and that the mutation does not affect the microtubuli. The results are consistent with a mutation affecting the microfilaments in the cytoskeleton.
TI  - Classification of medically important clostridia using restriction endonuclease site differences of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA.
AB  - Restriction maps were constructed of enzymically amplified 16S rRNA genes (rDNA)  isolated from eight Clostridium species. Using maximum parsimony, a dendrogram was constructed from these and published 16S rRNA sequence data. Two distinct clusters were identified: cluster I contained C. difficile, C. sordelli, and C. bifermentans, and showed 30 of 35 restriction sites in common; cluster II contained C. tetani, C. perfringens C. sporogenes and C. botulinum C and G, and showed 20 of 35 restriction sites in common. Further analysis of cluster I organisms revealed that of five HpaII fragments, two were found in equal amounts in all organisms, one was found in varying amounts in all organisms, and two were found, in varying amounts, only in C. sordelli and C. bifermentans. C. sordelli-specific and C. bifermentans-specific HpaII fragments were demonstrated by Southern hybridization of rDNA. One HpaII site within the rDNA was present on most alleles in C. bifermentans, present on a minority of alleles in C. sordelli and absent in C. difficile. This suggested that there were two 16S rRNA alleles with different sequences present within each of the genomes of C. bifermentans and C. sordelli.
TI  - Evaluation of the proposed interaction of nucleic acid with Clostridium difficile toxins A and B and the effects of nucleases on cytotoxicity.
AB  - Both DNA and RNA were found to co-purify with Clostridium difficile toxin B but not toxin A. DNAase treatment greatly reduced the cytotoxicity of toxin B but not of toxin A. RNAase had no effect on either toxin. The effects on toxin B were shown to be due to a contaminating protease and could be inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and phylogeny of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase encoded  by the plasmid pSCS7 from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) and its regulatory region, encoded by the plasmid pSCS7 from Staphylococcus aureus, was determined. The structural cat gene encoded a protein of 209 amino acids, which represented one monomer of the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Comparisons between the amino acid sequences of the pSCS7-encoded CAT from S. aureus and the previously sequenced CAT variants from S. aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Bacillus pumilis, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus mirabilis were performed. An alignment of CAT amino acid sequences demonstrated the presence of 34 conserved amino acids among all CAT variants. These conserved residues were considered for their possible roles in the structure and function of CAT. On the basis of the alignment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. It demonstrated relatively large evolutionary distances between the CAT variants of enteric bacteria, Clostridium, Bacillus, and Staphylococcus species.
TI  - An investigation into Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin-associated diarrhoea.
AB  - An investigation was carried out to establish the incidence of diarrhoea associated with the presence of enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens. The results indicate a high risk group, namely elderly hospitalized patients, who should be investigated for this organism in a similar way to Clostridium difficile if symptoms occur. The significance of antibiotic association is suggested and cross-infection was shown to be a possibility. Detection of the enterotoxin was accompanied in all cases by the presence of high faecal counts of enterotoxigenic strains of C. perfringens.
TI  - [The possibility of the serological differentiation of Clostridium species using  enzyme immunoassays].
AB  - A method for serotyping and diagnosis of 30 selected Clostridia strains of 12 different species by an enzyme-immuno-assay using polystyrene balls as a solid phase is described and tested for its efficiency. The reference strains and the homologous test strains could be differentiated from the heterologous in principle. A reliable detection of the several serotypes of Cl. perfringens was not perfectly to achieve with the conjugates used here, cross-reaction with Cl. chauvoei could be removed by absorption. The conjugate of Cl. bifermentans reacted with Cl. sordellii and Cl. difficile too, and must be absorbed prior any diagnostic applications with vegetative cells of the corresponding strains. Concerning the antigenic relationships between the Clostridia strains used here, the results of Ellner and Green (7, 8) as well as of Poxton and Byrne (14) could be reconfirmed. Moreover the applied technique offers the possibility to come to a more detailed result concerning the degree of antigenic relationship. The developed method is a valuable tool for the differentiation of pathogenic Clostridia and within the group Cl. bifermentans/Cl. sordellii/Cl. difficile a rapid diagnosis at the species level could be achieved. Some limitations by cross-reactions are given, but results can be improved by absorption of the conjugates.
TI  - Newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  - The improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. Several new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. WIN 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, Enterococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus spp. BMY 40062, PD 117558, PD 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these species. These drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and the Bacteroides fragilis group. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than Mycobacterium chelonae, and Mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. In addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against Mycobacterium leprae. Sparfloxacin, BMY 40062 and WIN 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular Legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. Improved antibacterial activity has also been found against Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas maltophilia. By contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including Plasmodium spp., Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani, but not against Toxoplasma gondii. In the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.
TI  - Travelers' diarrhea among United States military personnel during joint American-Egyptian armed forces exercises in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - A study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a United States military population on deployment in Cairo, Egypt, during July and August 1987. Acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. A possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. Enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (17% ST-producers, 13% LT-producers, and 3% LT/ST-producers); Shigella (9%); Campylobacter spp. (2%); Salmonella (2%); and Vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). Other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included Aeromonas hydrophila group, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Bacillus cereus. Yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive E. coli, intoxications by Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. A survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. Acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in U.S. military personnel deployed to Egypt.
TI  - Cellular and molecular actions of binary toxins possessing ADP-ribosyltransferase activity.
AB  - Clostridial organisms produce a number of binary toxins. Thus far, three complete toxins (botulinum, perfringens and spiroforme) and one incomplete toxin (difficile) have been identified. In the case of complete toxins, there is a heavy chain component (Mr approximately 100,000) that binds to target cells and helps create a docking site for the light chain component (Mr approximately 50,000). The latter is an enzyme that possesses mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase activity. The toxins appear to proceed through a three step sequence to exert their effects, including a binding step, an internalization step and an intracellular poisoning step. The substrate for the toxins is G-actin. By virtue of ADP-ribosylating monomeric actin, the toxins prevent polymerization as well as promoting depolymerization. The most characteristic cellular effect of the toxins is alteration of the cytoskeleton, which leads directly to changes in cellular morphology and indirectly to changes in cell function (e.g. release of chemical mediators). Binary toxins capable of modifying actin are likely to be useful tools in the study of cell biology.
TI  - [Bacterial enterotoxins: structure, mode of action].
AB  - The enterotoxins are macro-proteins, produced by enterotoxic bacterial strains acting in the human or animal intestine during digestive infections. In most cases, they induce diarrhoea (associated or not with tissue damage). These molecules differ in their structure and mechanism of action. Some of them (cholera toxin, Escherichia coli LT) activate a cyclase system (adenylate or guanylate cyclase), inducing water and electrolyte flux in the gut. Conversely, others (toxins A and B, Clostridium difficile; Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin; verotoxin), provoke diarrhoea, intestinal damage associated with inflammatory response acting on cellular functions (protein synthesis, permeability to small molecules). Most enterotoxins act via membrane receptors which they specifically recognize on the surface of the enterocyte.
TI  - [Value of microbiologic studies for diagnosis of post-enteritis reactive arthritis].
AB  - Reactive arthritis may develop within a period of some days until upto 3 weeks after infections with Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Shigella and Salmonella. Intestinal infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Cryptosporidium, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia saginata and Schistosoma mansoni are, in some cases, considered to be responsible for reactive arthritis. Detection of pathogenic bacteria in feces is generally most successful in the early stage of the infection. A large spectrum of special tests is required in order to detect all the causative agents and to ensure reliable results. It is therefore necessary that the laboratory is provided with information about the diagnostic object and the tentative diagnosis. The detection of serum antibodies to Y. enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis, C. jejuni/coli, and Schistosoma may suggest connections between infection and reactive arthritis.
TI  - Formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - 1. Microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. Among them, 12 strains (Mitsuokella multiacidus, Clostridium perfringens, C. innocuum, C. clostiriiforme, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. sp., Eubacterium limosum, E. aerofaciens, E. multiforme, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and P. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. Clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. When Clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute structure had an (S)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric excess.
TI  - [In vitro activity of imipenem against hospital bacteria].
AB  - Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae: the different bacterial groups exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), except for Serratia (0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), Proteus mirabilis (0.5 micrograms/ml), indole-positive Proteus (2 micrograms/ml) and Providencia (1 mu/ml). The MICs of cefotaxime-resistant strains (cephalosporinase hyperproducing or very broad spectrum betalactamase producing) were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2 micrograms/ml), although resistant strains by decrease of permeability were observed, and against Acinetobacter (mode MIC 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml). The MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 0.5) for Haemophilus and from 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of the betalactamase producing status. The MICs for N. meningitidis were less than 0.06 micrograms/ml. Methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low MICs ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 0.016). The MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely from 0.016 to 64 micrograms/ml and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008 to 0.03 micrograms/ml). The MICs for enterococci varied from 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 1-2). With the exception of Clostridium difficile, anaerobic bacteria were inhibited by concentrations lower than 1 (mode MIC 0.06 for C. Perfringens and 0.03 for Bacteroides fragilis).
TI  - In vitro activity of teicoplanin, vancomycin, A16686, clindamycin, erythromycin and fusidic acid against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of teicoplanin and A16686, two new glycopeptide antibiotics was determined against 196 isolates of anaerobic bacteria. The activity of teicoplanin and A16686, in comparison with that of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin and fusidic acid was 2 to 16 times higher against the gram positive anaerobes, namely, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species and Peptostreptococcus species. However, Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to teicoplanin and A16686 while Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides bivius were found to be sensitive.
TI  - [Infectious diarrhea in the adult].
AB  - Infectious diarrhoeas are usually divided into two types; toxinogenic and invasive. Invasive diarrhoeas are copious and responsible for dehydration which is the principal clinical sign; mucosal lesions and bacteraemia are absent. The most typical of toxinogenic diarrhoeas is cholera, but enterotoxicogenic E. coli and Aeromonas infections have similar clinical features. In invasive diarrhoeas the responsible microorganisms penetrate into the epithelial cells of the intestine, producing fever and stools that contain blood and mucus. However, some organisms causing invasive diarrhoeas secrete cytotoxins; they include Shigella spp., Salmonella spp, some strains of E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia spp. When diarrhoea occurs in patients under antibiotics pseudomembranous colitis due to the proliferation of Clostridium difficile must be suspected; the diagnosis is suggested by endoscopy and confirmed by bacteriology. Toxic and infectious diarrhoeas due to food are increasingly frequent; they are usually caused by Salmonella spp., but sometimes by Clostridium perfringens or Staphylococcus aureus. In patients with suspected infectious diarrhoea symptomatic treatment combined or not with intestinal antibacterial agents is immediately initiated in most cases; stool cultures are reserved to severe or protracted diarrhoeas. Specimens must be collected under the best conditions and rapidly sent to the laboratory.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
TI  - The growth-inhibitory properties of meropenem against anaerobes of clinical importance.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem against anaerobic bacteria was assessed by an  agar dilution procedure. MICs were measured for 449 clinical isolates and reference strains. Meropenem showed excellent activity against both Gram-negative anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), and Gram-positive anaerobes. The MIC90 for Clostridium perfringens was 0.01 mg/l. Meropenem had comparable activity to imipenem against Gram-negative anaerobes but was more active than imipenem against clostridia, including C. difficile (MIC90 2 mg/l compared with 8 mg/l). Meropenem was more active against anaerobes than was cefoxitin, metronidazole or clindamycin.
TI  - Hybridization analysis of three chloramphenicol resistance determinants from Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - The chloramphenicol resistance determinant from a nonconjugative strain of Clostridium perfringens was cloned and shown to be expressed in Escherichia coli. Subcloning and deletion analysis localized the resistance gene, catQ, to within a 1.25-kilobase (kb) partial Sau3A fragment. The catQ gene contained internal HindII, HaeIII, and DraI restriction sites and was distinct from the catP gene, which was originally cloned (L. J. Abraham, A. J. Wales, and J. I. Rood Plasmid 14:37-46, 1985) from the conjugative C. perfringens R plasmid, pIP401. Hybridization studies were carried out with a 0.35-kb DraI-P fragment of pJIR260 as an internal catQ-specific probe and a 0.38-kb EcoRV-HinfI fragment of pJIR62 as an internal catP-specific gene probe. The results showed that the catP and catQ genes were not similar and that neither probe hybridized with cat genes from other bacterial genera. However, the catP gene was similar to the cloned catD gene from Clostridium difficile. Comparative studies with both catP and catD probes showed that these genes had significant restriction identity. We therefore suggest that these genes were derived from a common source.
TI  - Cloning and hybridization analysis of ermP, a macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance determinant from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The erythromycin resistance determinant from Clostridium perfringens CP592 was cloned and shown to be expressed in Escherichia coli. The resultant plasmid, pJIR122 (7.9 kilobase pairs [kb]), was unstable since in both recA+ and recA E. coli hosts spontaneous deletion of 2.7 kb, including the erythromycin resistance determinant, was observed. Subcloning, as well as deletion analysis with BAL 31, localized the erythromycin resistance gene (ermP) to within a 1.0-kb region of pJIR122. A 0.5-kb fragment internal to ermP was 32P labeled and used as an ermP-specific probe in DNA hybridization experiments which used target DNA prepared from representatives of each of the known erm classes and also from erythromycin-resistant isolates of a variety of clostridial species. Hybridizing sequences were detected in DNA from several Clostridium difficile isolates and a Clostridium paraputrificum strain; however, ermP was not widespread in erythromycin-resistant C. perfringens isolates. The ermP determinant hybridized to, and shared significant restriction identity with, the ermB class gene from the streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1. No hybridization was detected with the other six hybridization classes of erm determinants.
TI  - Purification of the Clostridium spiroforme binary toxin and activity of the toxin on HEp-2 cells.
AB  - The two components Sa (Mr, 44,000) and Sb (Mr, 92,000) of Clostridium spiroforme  toxin were identified and characterized. Serological data permitted the identification of two groups of actin ADP-ribosylating clostridial toxins. The first consists of only C. botulinum C2. The second group includes spiroforme toxin, iota toxin of C. perfringens E, and an enzyme called CDT found in one strain of C. difficile, antibodies against which cross-react with all of the members of both groups. C. spiroforme toxin acted on cells by disrupting microfilaments by ADP-ribosylation of G actin. Toxicity was not blocked by 10 or 20 mM ammonium chloride and was only moderately inhibited by 30 mM NH4Cl. Inhibition of coated-pit formation in HEp-2 cells by potassium depletion strongly protected against the effect of C. spiroforme toxin. Toxicity was not blocked by incubation of HEp-2 cells and spiroforme toxin at 15 degrees C. These results suggest that this new binary toxin enters cells via the coated-pit-coated-vesicle pathway and might reach the cytoplasm at the same time as or before transfer to early endosomes.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - [Comparison of the sporocidal effects of two different disinfectants i a model experiment with pathogenic and nonpathogenic clostridial spore as well as with Bacillus cereus].
AB  - Official methods concerning the examination of sporocidal effects of disinfectants are presently lacking in the Federal Republic of Germany. Spore resistance of selected clostridial species towards formaldehyde and peracetic acid was examined by suspension tests and germ-carrier tests in comparison to spores of Bacillus cereus. Formaldehyde in concentrations between 5% and 20% as well as peracetic acid in concentrations between .004% and .125% were tested. Spore concentration of 10(6) spores/ml in the suspension-tests and 10(4) spores/ml in the germ-carrier tests with wooden germ-carriers were used. Against formaldehyde spores of Cl. septicum had the lowest resistance in the suspension tests followed by Cl. difficile, Cl. tertium, Cl. bifermentans and Cl. perfringens. Cl. sporogenes strain NCTC 532 had the most resistant spores. Concerning peracetic acid the situation was nearly the same. The resistance of all spores of pathogenic species under investigation towards chemical disinfectants was covered by those of Cl. sporogenes NCTC 532 treated with isopropanol. Isopropanol treated spores of B. cereus offer an alternative solution for practical disinfectant testing because spore production as well as growth of clostridia entail great expense. In order to cover the resistance of spores of Cl. perfringens A, the most resistant pathogenic clostridial species tested here, increased spore concentrations of B. cereus would be necessary.
TI  - [Enumeration and identification of Clostridium from stools treated with the thioglycollate-lysozyme method].
AB  - We have used spore isolation by the sodium thioglycolate-lysozyme technique on collected stools. Of the 51 stools studied, we found 41% of Clostridium perfringens with an average ratio of 10(4) germs/gr. 15 strains were typical double hemolysis and trehalose positive-5 presented only one hemolysis and were trehalose negative. We only found a single strain of Clostridium difficile with a rate of 10(4) germs/gr in the stools of a 10 months infant.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef compared to moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and  clindamycin against anaerobes.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of flomoxef (6315-S), moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and clindamycin against anaerobes 197 clinical isolates (27 Bacteroides fragilis, 42 B. thetaiotaomicron, 10 B. vulgatus, 7 B. ovatus, 6 B. uniformis, 6 B. distasonis, 7 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, 11 Bacteroides oralis group, 21 Clostridium difficile, 7 C. perfringens, 3 C. sporogenes, 3 Clostridium spp., 33 Propionibacterium acnes, 14 Peptococcaceae) were studied by means of agar dilution tests. The MIC90 of B. fragilis was less than 2 micrograms/ml for flomoxef, less than 4 micrograms/ml for moxalactam, less than 16 micrograms/ml for cefoxitin, less than 128 micrograms/ml for cefotaxime and less than 2 micrograms/ml for clindamycin. The respective MIC90's of B. thetaiotaomicron were less than 64, less than 128, less than 32, less than 256 and 8 micrograms/ml. Strains of the other Bacteroides species and groups were more susceptible to flomoxef and the other antibiotics than B. thetaiotaomicron. Against Clostridium difficile flomoxef (MIC90 less than 4 micrograms/ml) proved to be superior to the other agents tested. Most of the Clostridium strains other than C. difficile were also susceptible to flomoxef; anaerobic grampositive cocci and Propionibacterium acnes were very sensitive (MIC90's less than 1 and less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml, respectively). Its anti-anaerobic activity, together with its efficacy against aerobes, should make flomoxef a useful adjunct to the arsenal of modern antibiotic therapy.
TI  - The comparative in-vitro activity of ofloxacin.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared with that of nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, enoxacin, pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Ofloxacin was very active against nalidixic acid-susceptible isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae (MIC less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) and was also active against strains resistant to nalidixic acid (MIC less than or equal to 2 mg/l). The activity was similar to norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin but some four-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin. All of the fluoroquinolones were highly active against Vibrio cholerae (MIC less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), V. parahaemolyticus (MIC less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) Aeromonas hydrophila (MIC less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l), Plesiomonas shigelloides (MIC less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), Campylobacter jejuni (MIC less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l), Neisseria spp., Haemophilus influenzae, H. ducreyi, Bordetella pertussis and Legionella pneumophila (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l for all species). Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin (MIC less than or equal to 1, 2 and 2 mg/l, respectively) showed similar activity against Staphylococcus spp. and were somewhat more active than enoxacin (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l) and norfloxacin (MIC less than or equal to 8 mg/l). Ofloxacin was moderately active against beta-haemolytic Streptococcus spp. (MIC less than or equal to 2 mg/l), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and Cory. jeikeium (MIC less than or equal to 2 mg/l) and somewhat less active against alpha- and non-haemolytic Streptococcus spp., Str. pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l for all species) and Str. faecalis (MIC less than or equal to 8 mg/l). The activity of ofloxacin, against these species, was similar to ciprofloxacin and four to eight times greater than norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin. Ofloxacin, and all of the fluoroquinolones, were less active against anaerobic than aerobic bacteria. Clostridium perfringens (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) was more susceptible to ofloxacin than were other anaerobic species and Cl. difficile (MIC less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was more resistant. Ofloxacin was the most active compound tested against Chlamydia trachomatis SA2f (MIC less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l) with only ciprofloxacin (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) approaching similar activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Actin-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase produced by a Clostridium difficile strain.
AB  - By screening possible ADP-ribosyltransferase activities in culture supernatants from various Clostridium species, we have found one Clostridium difficile strain (CD196) (isolated in our laboratory) that is able to produce, in addition to toxins A and B, a new ADP-ribosyltransferase that was shown to covalently modify cell actin as Clostridium botulinum C2 or Clostridium perfringens E iota toxins do. The molecular weight of the CD196 ADP-ribosyltransferase (CDT) was determined to be 43 kilodaltons, and its isoelectric point was 7.8. No cytotoxic activity on Vero cells or lethal activity upon injection in mice was associated with this enzyme. CDT was neither related to C. difficile A or B toxins nor to C. botulinum C2 toxin component I. However, Vero cells cultivated in the presence of C. difficile B toxin had a lower amount of actin able to be ADP-ribosylated by CDT or C2 toxin in vitro. Antibodies raised against CDT reacted by immunoblot analysis with a 43-kilodalton protein of C. perfringens type E culture supernatant producing the iota toxin.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. Therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. High metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. The same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.
TI  - Clostridium spiroforme toxin is a binary toxin which ADP-ribosylates cellular actin.
AB  - We have purified from Clostridium spiroforme strain 246 an heterogeneous population of proteins (Sa) ranging from 43 to 47 kilodaltons exhibiting ADP-ribosyl transferase activity as do C. botulinum C2 toxin component I or the ia chain of C. perfringens E iota toxin. C. spiriforme Sa had alone no activity upon injection in mice or inoculated to Vero cells. When spiroforme ADP ribosyl transferase were mixed with a trypsin activated protein (Sb) separated from C. spiroforme bacterial supernatant, a lethal effect in mice and cytotoxicity on Vero cells were recorded. The Sa cross-reacted immunologically with either the light chain of C. perfringens E iota toxin or the ADP-ribosyl transferase from C. difficile 196 strain. No immunological relatedness was observed between Sa and C2 toxin component I. C. spiroforme toxin is thus another binary toxin close to iota.
TI  - Hybridization analysis of the class P tetracycline resistance determinant from the Clostridium perfringens R-plasmid, pCW3.
AB  - The tetracycline resistance determinant from pCW3, a conjugative plasmid from Clostridium perfringens, has been identified and the structural gene localized to within a 1.4-kb region. Hybridization analysis, which utilized an internal 0.8-kb specific gene probe, showed that eight nonconjugative tetracycline resistant C. perfringens strains all carried homologous resistance determinants. No homology was detected in DNA prepared from tetracycline resistant isolates of Clostridium difficile or Clostridium sporogenes. However, the one strain of Clostridium paraputrificum that was tested did contain an homologous determinant. No homology was found to any of the recognized classes of tetracycline resistance determinants. The C. perfringens tetracycline resistance determinant represents a new hybridization group, Class P.
TI  - [Morphological changes in human embryonic lung fibroblasts caused by cytotoxins of various Clostridium species].
AB  - A total of 243 strains of 35 Clostridium species were tested for cytotoxin production in cooked meat medium or liver broth within 48-72 h at 37 degrees C, using human embryonal lung fibroblasts in tissue-culture as indicator cells. Cytotoxin could be detected in the culture-filtrates of all toxigenic strains of C. chauvoei, C. difficile, C. histolyticum, C. novyi types A and B, C. septicum and C. tetani, but not in the atoxigenic ones. The cytotoxin of C. novyi correlated with alpha-toxin in the culture filtrate. All strains of C. perfringens and C. novyi D tested were not cytotoxic for lung fibroblasts despite their pathogenicity for guinea-pigs. Further cytotoxigenic strains were found among C. hastiforme, C. limosum, C. oceanicum, C. putrificum, C. ramosum, C. sordellii, C. sporogenes, and C. subterminale. The morphological changes in lung fibroblasts caused by the culture filtrates were characteristic and species-specific and corresponded with pathogenicity for guinea-pigs and/or mice. No cytotoxin was produced by C. absonum, C. barati, C. bifermentans, C. botulinum (atoxic), C. butyricum, C. cadaveris, C. carnis, C. clostridioforme, C. cochlearium, C. glycolicum, C. innocuum, C. malenominatum, C. mangenotii, C. paraputrificum, C. putrefaciens, C. rectum, C. tertium, and C. tyrobutyricum.
TI  - [Microbiological research methods of drinking water regulation in West Germany from 1986. Suitability of the specifications of DIN 38411, Part 7, for the detection of sulfite-reducing, spore-forming anaerobes (Clostridia)].
AB  - The drinking-water regulations of the Federal Republic of Germany, from 22.05.1986, contains in paragraph 1 the instructions: "Drinking-water must be free of pathogens", and further in paragraph 11, "Responsibilities of the employer or other owner of a water supplying facility", include that: "The official authority may direct, that the employer...of a water supplying facility has to extend or has to cause to extend the microbiological examinations in order to determine, that...sulfite-reducing, spore-forming anaerobes (Clostridia) can not be detected in 20 ml of water..." The drinking-water regulations do not prescribe a bacteriological examination method in detail. Appendix 1 rules only that the examination for sulfite-reducing, spore-forming anaerobes (Clostridia) has to be performed after heating the sample to 75 degrees C (+/- 5 degrees C) for 10 min, by either the multiple-tube or membrane filtration method and cultivation in DRCM1-medium. If growth occurs, the presence of Clostridia must be confirmed by anaerobic and aerobic subcultivation. Furthermore, a DIN-instruction (DIN 38411, part 7) exists, which prescribes a detailed procedure for multiple-tube and membrane filtration methods, but does not provide for strict anaerobiosis. We were, however, unable to detect Clostridia in a multitude of water samples with the methods of the DIN-regulation. In order to examine if neglect of strict anaerobiosis was the reason for these failures, we checked the suitability of the DIN-regulation for the isolation of Clostridia from drinking water. In preliminary tests we examined up to four strains of the species C. botulinum, C. cadaveris, C. cochlearium, C. difficile, C. innocuum, C. perfringens and C. tertium for their ability to form heat-resistent spores in four sporulation media. It was, however, not possible to find a medium, in which all strains could sporulate within one week. In order to characterize the detection of these anaerobes in water, one particularly well-sporulating strain of each of the following, C. cadaveris, C. difficile and C. perfringens, was selected and the multiple-tube and membrane-filtration methods were compared. Counts of C. difficile and C. perfringens detected by the multiple-tube method were identical with counts of test-suspensions determinded by the most probable number (MPN) method. It was found to be decisive that only freshly prepared DRCM-medium be used and that, disagreeing with the DIN-instruction, cultivation at 37 degrees C is continued for at least four days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin with a (Z)-propenyl side chain at the 3 position and a p-hydroxyphenylglycyl substituent at the 7 position, was evaluated in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin and, when appropriate, ampicillin and vancomycin. In vitro, BMY 28100 was more active than the reference cephalosporins against streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. BMY 28100 was comparable to cefaclor and more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and ampicillin-susceptible strains of Branhamella catarrhalis; but against ampicillin-resistant strains of B. catarrhalis, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin and more active than cefaclor. Against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin, but less active than cefaclor. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae overall were equally susceptible to BMY 28100 and cefaclor but were less susceptible to cephalexin. In human serum, BMY 28100 was 45% protein bound. After an oral dose to mice, 82% of the drug was recovered in urine. The oral therapeutic efficacy of BMY 28100 in systemically infected mice reflected its activity in vitro.
TI  - In vitro activity of imipenem against gram-positive anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of imipenem, a new penem antibiotic, was determined against 210 clinical Gram-positive anaerobic isolates and compared with the activities of metronidazole, clindamycin, cefoxitin, moxalactam, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone and cefotiam. All investigated strains were inhibited by a 4-mg/l concentration of imipenem. Cefoxitin demonstrated good activity against most strains with exception of some Clostridium difficile and Clostridium ramosum strains. Cephalosporins were classed in decreasing activity order as follows: cefoxitin moxalactam ceftriaxone ceftizoxime cefotiam. Metronidazole had better activity against Clostridium spp. than against non-sporulated bacilli. Clindamycin resistance rates were superior to 10% for most groups, with the exception of Clostridium perfringens. Actinomyces and Bifidobacterium. Imipenem was the most potent inhibitor, as 81% and 95% of tested strains were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l respectively.
TI  - The effect of carbon dioxide on the in vitro activity of erythromycin and RU-28965 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of erythromycin and RU-28965 (a novel macrolide antimicrobial with improved pharmacokinetics) was determined against a variety of anaerobic bacteria in anaerobic atmospheres with and without added carbon dioxide. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using an antimicrobial incorporation technique in Wilkins-Chalgren agar (Oxoid, UK) containing saponinlysed horse blood to a final concentration of 10%. The inoculum used was approximately 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) contained in 10 microliters Wilkins-Chalgren broth, which was applied to the surface of the agar plates using a multipoint inoculator. Following inoculation, plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic atmosphere containing 10% carbon dioxide or in hydrogen alone. The MIC of each antimicrobial for each organism examined was determined as the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial which completely inhibited growth of the inoculum. The minimum concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 50% (MIC50) and 90% (MIC90) of the bacteria examined were also determined. The MICs of erythromycin and RU-28965 for isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group, B. bivius and Fusobacterium spp. were generally 10-100 times greater when determined in the presence of carbon dioxide than when determined in hydrogen alone. The MICs of erythromycin and RU-28965 for B. melaninogenicus, Peptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile and Propionibacterium acnes were less affected by the presence of carbon dioxide.
TI  - In vitro activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antimicrobial, was determined against a total of 286 anaerobic bacteria including Bacteroides fragilis group (100), B. melaninogenicus (21), B. bivius (16), Fusobacterium spp. (15), Peptococcus spp. (20), Peptostreptococcus spp. (21), Clostridium perfringens (23), C. difficile (41) and Propionibacterium acnes (29). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using an antimicrobial incorporation technique in Wilkins-Chalgren agar approximately 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) contained in 10 microliters Wilkins-Chalgren broth, which was applied to the surface of the agar plates using a multipoint inoculator. Following inoculation, plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic atmosphere. Both vancomycin and teicoplanin were highly active against all the Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria examined, 90% of all isolates being inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml of either antimicrobial. Isolates of B. fragilis group and Fusobacterium spp. were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 64 micrograms/ml) and teicoplanin (MIC90 128 micrograms/ml). Unexpectedly, isolates of B. melaninogenicus and B. bivius which were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 64 and 128 micrograms/ml respectively) were sensitive to teicoplanin (MIC90 2 and 2 micrograms/ml respectively).
TI  - [In vitro effect of piperacillin, amoxicillin, cefoxitin and metronidazole against obligate anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of piperacillin and three other antibiotics (amoxicillin, cefoxitin, metronidazole) against 165 strains of obligate anaerobes isolated in hospitals in 1985 and 1986 were determined by the Wilkins-Chalgren agar medium dilution method. Among the 67 strains of Bacteroides fragilis, 98.5% were sensitive to piperacillin (MIC less than or equal to 128 mg/l), 100% were sensitive to metronidazole (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l), 11.9% were resistant to cefoxitin (MIC greater than 32 mg/l) and 46% were resistant to amoxicillin (MIC greater than 16 mg/l). The MIC50 was about 4 mg/l with piperacillin, 8 mg/l with cefoxitin and 0.5 mg/l with metronidazole. All 32 strains of Clostridium perfringens were sensitive to the 4 antibiotics tested, with an MIC50 of about 0.06 mg/l with piperacillin, 0.125 mg/l with amoxicillin and 0.5 mg/l with cefoxitin and metronidazole. All other strains of Clostridium spp. (33 in all) were sensitive to piperacillin and metronidazole; the MIC's were about 0.06 mg/l with piperacillin, 0.25 mg/l with amoxicillin and metronidazole and 0.5 mg/l with cefoxitin. Seven strains (C. innocuum 5, C. difficile 1, C. ramosum 1) were resistant to cefoxitin. All 33 strains of Peptostreptococcus and Peptococcus were sensitive to the 4 antibiotics tested. Although metronidazole still is the most effective of anti-anaerobes agents, piperacillin has proved to be effective against most anaerobic bacteria, including B. fragilis. It is clearly superior to amoxicillin and relatively superior to cefoxitin, notably against this species.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  - The relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two Bacteroides spp., eight Gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric Gram-negative aerobic rods. Abscesses were induced by all seven Clostridium perfringens and three C. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. Selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric Gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. Enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. Enhancement was observed mainly with C. perfringens in mixed infections. By contrast, other Clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. Clostridium difficile and C. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species. This study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are predominant anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are common pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses and orofacial infections. Clostridium perfringens can cause bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause diarrhea or antibiotic-associated colitis.
TI  - Fecal bacterial microflora of newborn infants during intensive care management and treatment with five antibiotic regimens.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic fecal bacterial flora of normal newborn infants, of preterm newborn infants without other health problems and of five groups of newborn infants treated with combinations of benzylpenicillin, cloxacillin, flucloxacillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin and gentamicin were compared. Preterm birth alone was associated with growth of Klebsiella which could be attributed to a higher rate of cesarean section in preterm than in term infants. All antibiotic regimens led to a pronounced suppression of anaerobic flora and overgrowth of Klebsiella but not with other gram-negative aerobic bacteria. A slight colonization with Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens occurred. Disturbances of the intestinal microbial ecology can be expected in newborn infants after preterm birth by cesarean section and/or treatment with antibiotics, including some penicillins that are usually regarded as relatively harmless in this respect in adults.
TI  - [Comparison between the number and nature of fecal clostridia and other risk factors implicated in the intestinal pathology of newborn infants].
AB  - One-hundred and fifteen infants aged 1 to 31 days from two intensive-care units were grouped into 6 classes according to clinical criteria (enterocolitis with or without anatomopathological examination and pneumatosis intestinalis, "haemorrhagic colitis", acute diarrhoea or absence of intestinal disorders). The total number of viable bacteria, the number of Clostridium and, in some cases, the presence of rota- and/or coronavirus were determined in their stools. The incidence of Clostridium in the stools of infants with enterocolitis (with or without pneumatosis intestinalis) or haemorrhagic colitis was not significantly different from that of infants without intestinal disorders, whereas stools of infants with acute diarrhoea less often contained Clostridium than those of other infants. C. butyricum, C. difficile, C. perfringens, C. tertium, and C. sordellii were identified. Correspondence analysis comparing the variable, "clinical profile", with 23 other variables, suggested that the variables of gemellity, a birthweight below 1900 g, a gestational age of less than 35 weeks, respiratory distress, umbilical catheterization and a Clostridium count above 10(7)/g at the onset of clinical signs, i.e. between 8 to 12 days of age, were linked to the clinical profile of necrotizing enterocolitis with pneumatosis intestinalis. Conversely, the absence of gemellity, a high birthweight and gestational age, the absence of respiratory distress or umbilical catheterization, the onset of diarrhoea within 8 days, and the presence of rota- and/or coronavirus in the stools were linked with a clinical profile of acute diarrhoea.
TI  - [In vitro activity of roxithromycin, new semisynthetic macrolide against obligate anaerobes].
AB  - The "in vitro" susceptibility to roxithromycin and three other macrolides of 236  anaerobes isolated from clinical samples in 1984/1985 was determined by an agar-dilution method on Wilkins Chalgren medium. 90% of Gram positive cocci were susceptible to both roxithromycin and josamycin (MIC less than 1 mg/l, whereas 1 mg/l erythromycin and 2 mg/l spiramycin were able to inhibit respectively 46 and 86% of the same tested strains. No resistance to the four macrolides was observed among Eubacterium, propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium. Two C. perfringens strains and one C. difficile strain were resistant to all four macrolides, while 97% of Clostridium sp. strains were inhibited by 4 mg/l erythromycin, josamycin or roxithromycin. Against Gram positive anaerobes, roxithromycin was equal or superior to erythromycin and spiramycin. At a concentration of 4 mg/l, roxithromycin inhibited 82% of B. fragilis strains. Roxithromycin and josamycin were more active against Gram negative bacilli that erythromycin and spiramycin. Macrolides had no effect on Fusobacterium strains. In this study, 4 mg/l roxithromycin inhibited 217 of the 236 anaerobic strains investigated (92%).
TI  - Relationships between rotavirus diarrhea and intestinal microflora establishment  in conventional and gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - Intestinal microflora did not play a role in the intensity or course of EDIM rotavirus-induced diarrhea, since similar results were observed in axenic and conventional mice. In conventional mice, rotavirus-induced diarrhea did not modify the establishment of Lactobacillus spp. and Escherichia coli before weaning. The consequences of diarrhea on the establishment of strictly anaerobic bacteria after weaning were studied through the measurement of two bacterial functions, the microbial barrier effect against E. coli and the development of the immunoglobulin A intestinal immune system. These two bacterial functions were expressed in a similar way in diarrheic and control mice. In young gnotobiotic mice inoculated with Clostridium perfringens or C. difficile, rotavirus infection led to an earlier development of both strains, as compared with controls. This effect was more pronounced with C. difficile. These results suggest that rotavirus infections might enhance opportunistic bacterial infections.
TI  - Changes in the cell wall of Clostridium species following passage in animals.
AB  - Morphological changes in clostridial isolates after animal passage with other flora in mixed infections were studied by utilizing a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of 7 clostridial species, and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Abscesses were induced by all 7 Clostridium perfringens and 3 Clostridium butyricum isolates and by some of the other isolates. A thick granular wall prior to animal inoculation was shown only in C. perfringens, C. butyricum, and C. difficile. This structure was observed in other clostridia only following their animal passage alone or when co-inoculated with K. pneumoniae or B. fragilis.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Epidemiology, etiology and laboratory diagnosis of infectious diarrhea diseases  in the tropics].
AB  - Diarrhoeal diseases belong to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries, especially in infants and small children. About one billion episodes are estimated for this group of age with 4.6 million fatalities. Many causes are discussed to explain the high incidence: bottle feeding of infants, protein malnutrition, unsafe drinking water and unsafe disposal of excrements and sewage, unsufficient consciousness of personal and domestic hygiene, lack of knowledge on the origin of disease, and inadequate food hygiene. Among the viral infectious agents rotavirus is isolated from 30-40% of enteritis cases in infants and small children; Norwalk virus, adenovirus and human calicivirus, too, appear to occur worldwide. Enteropathogenic (EPEC) and, especially, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are of primary importance as bacterial pathogens. Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli primarily cause disease in infants and small children. Shigellae are important whereas salmonellae are less frequently identified as a cause for diarrhoeal illness. Yersinia enterocolitica is rare in tropical countries. Cholera and infections with other vibrionaceae (V. cholerae non-01, V. mimicus, V. parahaemolyticus, aeromonas, Plesiomonas shigelloides) mainly occur in coastal areas. Clostridium perfringens type C is the causal agent of Enteritis necroticans in several countries, especially New Guinea. C. difficile appears to be of minor importance. Among the parasites Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica are the most important organisms causing diarrhoeal disease. Macroscopic (visible blood) and microscopic stool examination (faecal leukocytes) may be helpful in dysenteric disease to distinguish between shigella and E. histolytica infections; it is, however, of limited usefulness to discriminate between organisms causing watery diarrhoea.
TI  - Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens in upper gut of infants with protracted diarrhoea.
AB  
TI  - Enteric colonization in sporadic neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  - Microflora of the gut was studied close to the onset of sporadic necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in neonates. Enteric flora in 25 babies with NEC differed from that in 23 matched controls. Bacteroides spp and lactobacilli were less common in babies with NEC compared with controls: 32 versus 61% (p = 0.03) and 12 versus 48% (p = 0.006), respectively. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from 40% of babies with NEC compared with 13% of controls (p = 0.03). It was present in 33% of babies with NEC aged less than 14 days but was not detected in control babies of the same age. The incidences of C. butyricum and C. difficile were similar in patients and controls. Colonization with C. perfringens in the absence of a protective barrier flora may be crucial in the pathogenesis of severe sudden onset NEC. Two potentially valuable marker factors to predict onset of this form of sporadic NEC are the use of fecal smears and estimation of fecal tryptic activity.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to Sch 34343 and other antibiotics.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 was evaluated against 137 strains of anaerobic bacteria by the agar dilution technique. Sch 34343 was compared with imipenem, cefoxitin, latamoxef (moxalactam), clindamycin and metronidazole. Organisms studied included the Bacteroides fragilis group, other Bacteroides spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile, other Clostridium spp. and anaerobic cocci. Overall, Sch 34343 and imipenem were significantly more active than the other antibiotics against most organisms tested, especially the Bact. fragilis group, including clindamycin-resistant strains. Apart from Cl. difficile, which required up to 8 mg/l of Sch 34343 and imipenem for inhibition, all the strains were inhibited by 1 mg/l of Sch 34343 and by 2 mg/l of imipenem. Of the remaining agents tested, against the Bact. fragilis group metronidazole (2 mg/l to inhibit 90% of the strains) was the most active, followed by cefoxitin (16 mg/l), latamoxef (32 mg/l) and clindamycin (32 mg/l). On the basis of its activity in vitro, Sch 34343 appears to be one of the most promising new antimicrobial agents for the treatment of infections involving anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Activity of a peptidyl prodrug, alafosfalin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Alafosfalin, an antibacterial phosphonodipeptide requiring peptide transport for  activity, was tested for activity against clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria in peptide-free Roche Sensitivity Test Medium no. 5 agar. It was active against Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Clostridium perfringens but not against Clostridium difficile. Alafosfalin activity was antagonized by appropriate peptides. Synergy was obtained with other cell wall-active antibiotics.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - Ceftazidime in the treatment of neonatal infection.
AB  - The efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of neonatal sepsis was studied in 42 low birthweight premature babies. Forty-nine courses of ceftazidime (25 mg/kg bd, iv or im were administered. In 19 babies, treatment was stopped after 48 h, the remainder were treated for 5 days or more. Six neonates had bacteriological evidence of infection, one other was pyrexial and 29 had radiological evidence compatible with respiratory tract infection. Eight of the study population died. Only one death was attributed to infection which arose 3 days after completion of a 5-day course of ceftazidime. Two babies developed clinical signs of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Clostridium difficile (7) and Cl. perfringens (2) were isolated from 34 post-treatment faecal samples but not from the two babies with NEC. No faecal sample contained Cl. difficile toxin. Post-treatment cultures from 12 neonates yielded ceftazidime-resistant micro-organisms. Ceftazidime therapy was not associated with significant alteration in serum alanine aminotransferase, urea, creatinine, protein or albumin. Four babies had an eosinophilia, three transient and one following two intrauterine transfusions. Coombs' tests were performed on 17 babies. There were no false positives. The abnormal clotting studies observed in one baby were not due to ceftazidime. In a concurrent pharmacokinetic study, the half-life of ceftazidime was 7.4 (SD +/- 4.1) h following iv administration. Other pharmacokinetic values were C max 74 (SD +/- 20) mg l-1 trough concentration 20 (SD +/- 10) mg l-1. Total body clearance ranged from 0.13 to 2.10 ml min-1 per kg and increased with increasing postnatal age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of Sch 34343 and cefbuperazone against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of Sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic, and cefbuperazone,  a new cephamycin antibiotic, were determined against 459 clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of imipenem and cefoxitin, respectively, by an agar dilution method. Both penems showed potent and similar activity against all anaerobic bacteria tested, particularly Peptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens. All organisms except a single strain of Fusobacterium necrogenes were inhibited by an 8 micrograms/ml concentration of either Sch 34343 or imipenem. Overall, gram-positive bacilli, particularly Lactobacillus species, Clostridium difficile, and Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces species, were relatively more resistant to either penem than other genera of anaerobic bacteria tested. Cefbuperazone demonstrated only modest activity against a wide spectrum of anaerobic bacteria. It had excellent and selective activity against B. fragilis and Bacteroides vulgatus but was highly inactive against Bacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron within the B. fragilis group. Both cephamycins showed virtually no activity against C. difficile and Lactobacillus spp. Although cefbuperazone was more active against Bifidobacterium spp., it had less activity against Fusobacterium spp., Eubacterium spp., and all Bacteroides spp. other than B. fragilis and B. vulgatus.
TI  - [Sensitivity of obligate anaerobes to ofloxacin, pefloxacin, enoxacin and norfloxacin].
AB  - The in vitro activity of four new quinolones against 355 obligate anaerobes was investigated. MICs were determined using the reference method of Sutter et al. [14]. The four fluorinated quinolones tested differ from nalidixic acid which is inactive on most anaerobes except for some Clostridium perfringens strains. All strains tested were inhibited by 64 and 16 mg/l pefloxacin and ofloxacin respectively. Except for Bacteroides, all strains were inhibited by 64 mg/l norfloxacin or enoxacin. Clostridium strains other than C. perfringens exhibited heterogeneity; C. difficile and C. ramosum had the highest MICs. Bacteroides fragilis proved less susceptible to fluorinated quinolones than the other obligate anaerobes. Ofloxacin showed the greatest activity, with 4 mg/l inhibiting 100% of C. perfringens and 83% of all anaerobes investigated.
TI  - Antitoxin activity of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL) inactivate Clostridium difficile cytotoxin and C. perfringens phospholipase C, but not C. perfringens enterotoxin. Both whole cells and sonicated suspensions possess activity, but mononuclear cell fractions of peripheral blood do not. Antitoxin activity closely correlates with cell concentration. The highest cell concentrations tested completely inactivated C. difficile cytotoxin by 2 min. Sucrose density gradient fractionation of PMNL showed antitoxin activity to be associated with myeloperoxidase, locating it in the primary or azurophil granules. Toxin inactivation was prevented by protease inhibitors suggesting that it is due to one of the neutral proteases present in these granules. PMNL are more active against C. difficile cytotoxin than purified chymotrypsin. PMNL may be a primary defence against certain bacterial exotoxins.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of clinical isolates of clostridia.
AB  - Over a 2 1/2 year period 361 clinical isolates of clostridia, representing 28 species, were tested for susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents. Penicillin resistant strains were tested for their ability to produce beta-lactamase: of the commonly isolated species only Clostridium beijerinckii/butyricum produced the enzyme. Cl. perfringens exhibited a low incidence of resistance to all of the agents tested. Cl. difficile showed a high degree of resistance to penicillin and clindamycin, whilst all strains were sensitive to vancomycin. Chloramphenicol and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid were found to be highly active against most clostridia; metronidazole was the only agent to which no resistance was demonstrable.
TI  - Clostridial toxins active locally in the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - Clostridium difficile and Clostridium spiroforme have only in recent years been recognized as intestinal pathogens. They both produce toxins that are also produced by other clostridia. C. difficile toxins A and B are produced by C. sordellii and a few strains of C. perfringens whereas C. spiroforme produces the same toxins as C. perfringens Type E (iota toxin). Iota toxin activity may be the product of two proteins. Toxigenic strains of C. spiroforme and Type E produce two antigens which possess much more biological activity when administered together than when given alone. C. difficile was thought for some time to produce only a single toxin, but then the enterotoxic activity was shown to be due to a separate toxin (toxin A). This toxin increases the oral toxicity of toxin B (the main cytotoxin) and may increase the permeability of the colon. Toxin A binds to a specific receptor in hamster brush border membranes and in the membranes of rabbit erythrocytes. This receptor appears to be a glycoprotein. The receptor can be extracted from the membrane with Triton and binds to immobilized toxin A. The receptor can be extracted and used to coat plastic plates as a first phase in an ELISA assay. Another assay has been developed in which the toxin A binds to the red cells and then the erythrocytes are agglutinated with antitoxin. An even more sensitive assay consists of using rabbit erythrocyte ghosts to bind the toxin and then precipitating the ghosts with antibody to toxin A attached to latex beads. Monoclonal antibodies to toxin A also have been developed and are used in these and other assays.
TI  - Diarrhoea and simultaneous excretion of Clostridium difficile cytotoxin and C perfringens enterotoxin.
AB  
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. The MICs of MT-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the MICs of MT-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. In contrast, the bactericidal activity of MT-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive Proteus species, Serratia marcescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Clostridium perfringens. In the treatment of systemic infections in mice, MT-141 was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. It was found that the 50% effective doses of the six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the MBCs than with the MICs. As the serum levels of MT-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity of MT-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.
TI  - Experimental and spontaneous clostridial enteropathies of laboratory and free living lagomorphs.
AB  - The enteric diseases of hares, European and cottontail rabbits, which are caused  by members of the genus Clostridium are reviewed. Disease caused by C. perfringens Types A and E, C. spiroforme, C. difficile, C. sordellii, C. tympany cuniculi and clostridial enterotoxins are included. Tyzzer's disease also is discussed.
TI  - Acute diarrhea in horses of the Potomac River area: examination for clostridial toxins.
AB  - Fecal specimens from horses in Montgomery County, Md, and in Fairfax and Loudoun  counties, Va, were examined for Clostridium perfringens type A enterotoxin and for C difficile cytotoxin (92 and 108 specimens, respectively). The toxins were found in feces from horses that had experienced an acute diarrhea syndrome and from clinically normal horses. The toxins did not appear to be primary determinants of the diarrhea syndrome, although they may have contributed to the spectrum of clinical entities observed.
TI  - Immediate postnatal inoculation of a microbial barrier to prevent neonatal diarrhea induced by Clostridium difficile in young conventional and gnotobiotic hares.
AB  - The cecal content of a healthy young hare (a 10-fold dilution prepared in anaerobiosis) was transferred into gnotobiotic recipient mice. The fecal flora of recipient mice was inoculated into 49 conventional young hares (kept in a closed building) immediately after birth. All the inoculated hares survived until weaning whereas 35% of 48 non-treated conventional hares died of diarrhea. Clostridium difficile and C perfringens were present in all the diarrheal noninoculated hares, whereas these species were present only in 50% of healthy inoculated or noninoculated hares at low concentrations (less than 10(6)/g of feces). A microbial barrier effect against challenge-exposure strains of C difficile and C perfringens was evidenced in the intestinal tract of recipient gnotobiotic mice and young hares. Seemingly, the protective effect of the microbial inoculum was due to antagonisms exerted against C difficile and C perfringens in the intestinal tract of inoculated conventional hares.
TI  - Comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  - It is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. Although the effect of most of these toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. The resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. The biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase, leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. The duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. Subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. The heat-labile toxins of V. cholerae, E. coli, Salmonella spp., A. hydrophila and Y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. Similarly the heat-stable toxins of E. coli and Y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. Classified along with the enterotoxin of C. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by Sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of E. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. In another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by Staph. aureus until more is known. Surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological and structural differences. Evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. The structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. It is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like V. cholerae.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of MT-141 against anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141, a new cephamycin, against anaerobic bacteria were compared with those of cefmetazole (CMZ), cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and cefazolin to obtain the following results. MT-141 showed high activity against a wide variety of anaerobic bacteria including B. fragilis and C. difficile except for Eubacterium lentum, E. aerofaciens and B. furcosus. Antibacterial activity of MT-141 against anaerobic bacteria was almost independent of inoculum size, medium, pH and serum addition. In vitro development of resistance of MT-141 against P. variabilis and B. fragilis was comparable to that of CMZ. Successive parenteral administration of MT-141 into mice did not cause abnormal proliferation of C. difficile. MT-141 showed excellent therapeutic effect against experimental subcutaneous abscess in mice caused by B. fragilis.
TI  - Demonstration of shared antigens in the genus Clostridium by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - Antigens prepared from several strains of each of 10 Clostridium species were used in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with antisera raised against whole cells of a representative strain from each of the 10 species killed by ultra-violet irradiation. With the exception of C. cadaveris, the antisera gave similar results with antigens prepared from all strains of the homologous species. Antigens prepared from 13 other clostridial species were then investigated in an ELISA system with the 10 representative antisera. The results showed many cross-reactions, particularly in the C. perfringens group, the C. difficile/sordelli group and the C. botulinum/novyi/sporogenes group.
TI  - The influence of drugs on the response of a cell culture preparation to bacterial toxins.
AB  - The influence was studied of lanthanum chloride, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, indomethacin and sodium cromoglycate on the morphological changes induced in Vero cells by the action of the cholera toxin, the thermolabile enterotoxin (LT) and the Vero cell cytotoxin (VT) of Escherichia coli, the enterotoxin of Clostridium perfringens, and the cytotoxin of Clostridium difficile. These drugs were able to inhibit the effects produced by C. difficile cytotoxin but not by the other toxins examined.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Anaerobes can be isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. Frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. The genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) OFFteroides, Clostridium, gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, and Bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (Veillonella and Acidaminococcus). Clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. Bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. Recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.
TI  - [Effect of the ingestion of wheat bran on the fecal microbial flora of human donors and of recipient gnotoxenic mice, and on the barrier effects exerted by these flora against various potentially pathogenic microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of bran ingestion on the flora of the human digestive tract was studied using two methods: quantitative enumeration of various microbial populations of the faecal flora, and a demonstration of the antagonistic effect exerted by the faecal flora against various potentially pathogenic bacteria of the environment. Since this latter study cannot be effected in human subjects, we used a model constituted by axenic mice inoculated with patients' flora. Faecal samples from 3 human donors receiving bran-containing diets were obtained prior to treatment and 30 days thereafter. These faecal samples were inoculated into axenic mice fed a diet with or without bran. The dominant floras of the human donors, before and after bran ingestion, were highly similar. The faecal floras of the gnotoxenic mice resembled those of the donors and no change resulting from the presence of bran in the diet could be observed. The drastic or permissive barrier effects exerted in the gnotoxenic mice by the human donors against Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not modified by the presence of bran in the diet. The large variability between animals in the barrier effect against Clostridium difficile masked any possible role of the bran. Study of the transit of Bacillus spores in the digestive tract of various mouse groups showed the existence of differences according to the origin of the inoculated floras, but not according to the presence or absence of bran in the diet.
TI  - Clostridial toxins in neonatal necrotising enterocolitis.
AB  - Clostridium difficile cytopathic toxin was found in the faeces or gut content of  five of 39 neonates with necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Toxin concentrations were uniformly low and did not differ from those found in healthy neonates. C difficile is unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of NEC. Stools from 33 babies with NEC were also tested for C perfringens alpha toxin, with negative results.
TI  - The intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  - The fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. Bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. Conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. The frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. Twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. The organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was Bifidobacterium breve. Bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent Bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was never isolated in this study. Further, the counts and incidences of Clostridium paraputrificum, C. perfringens, and Bacillus subtilis, the counts of C. clostridiiforme, Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis, S. faecalis, and S. faecium and the incidences of C. difficile, C. tertium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria and beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - This review is concerned with anaerobic bacteria and beta-lactam antibiotics. Data on the susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics of anaerobic isolates in Sweden during 1983 is presented. Among the different bacterial groups, Clostridium perfringens, anaerobic cocci and curved rods were found to be very susceptible to the beta-lactams tested. C. difficile was susceptible to benzylpenicillin, piperacillin and imipenem, but resistant to the second and third generation of cephalosporins. Most fusobacteria were susceptible to the beta-lactam antibiotics investigated. However, some strains were found to be resistant to the penicillins. Against the Bacteroides fragilis group, imipenem had the best activity whereas moxalactam, piperacillin and cefoxitin had good activities. The majority of the Bacteroides non-fragilis strains were still susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, an increasing number of isolates were found to be resistant, especially to the penicillins when comparing with data from the last five years. The known mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in anaerobic bacteria involve production of beta-lactamases, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins and blocked penetration of beta-lactams through the outer membranes of anaerobes. The presence of beta-lactamases in various Bacteroides and Clostridium species is reported as well as the characteristics of the different beta-lactamases encountered. The role of penicillin-binding proteins and penetration barrier in beta-lactam resistance is also discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in Sweden in 1983.
AB  - This review is concerned with anaerobic bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility. Data on the susceptibility to different antimicrobials of anaerobic isolates in Sweden during 1983 is presented. Among the different bacterial groups, Clostridium perfringens, propionibacteria, anaerobic cocci and curved rods were found to be susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin and chloramphenicol. C. difficile was susceptible to benzylpenicillin and imipenem, but resistant to cefoxitin. Most C. difficile strains were also susceptible to clindamycin and fusidic acid, while all strains were susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. The majority of the fusobacteria were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. However, some strains were found to be resistant to penicillins. Against the Bacteroides fragilis group, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole and imipenem had the best activity, whereas piperacillin and cefoxitin showed good activities. Most Bacteroides non-fragilis strains were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. However, an increasing number of isolates were found to be resistant especially to penicillins when comparing with data from the last five years.
TI  - Effect of erythromycin on microbial antagonisms: a study in gnotobiotic mice associated with a human fecal flora.
AB  - The effect of erythromycin base was studied on intestinal resistance to colonization of gnotobiotic mice inoculated with a human fecal flora and challenged with six microbial strains potentially pathogenic for immunocompromised patients. Fecal concentrations of erythromycin were greater than 1,000 micrograms/g in the human donor and in mice. Total intestinal bacterial counts were not significantly different in the human donor and in the recipient mice and were not affected by erythromycin treatment. Strains of various species from the dominant flora (greater than 10(9) colony-forming units/g) and resistant to greater than 1,000 micrograms of erythromycin/ml were present before and persisted during treatment. Strains sensitive to such concentrations - particularly all enterobacteria-were eliminated. Treatment did not reduce colonization resistance against Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, and erythromycin-sensitive Escherichia coli. It reduced but did not eliminate some colonization resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium difficile, and erythromycin-resistant E coli.
TI  - [Efficacy of tinidazole against anaerobes in comparison with metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and lamoxactam].
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory activity of tinidazole, metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and moxalactam was determined against 150 isolates of clinically important anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius and Clostridium perfringens by means of agar dilution tests. The members of 18 gramnegative and 14 grampositive species were inhibited by tinidazole at less than or equal to 0,01-8 micrograms/ml thus being without exception susceptible to the drug. A similar in vitro activity was recorded for metronidazole and ornidazole. Though cefoxitin and moxalactam generally had a good in vitro activity against most anaerobic species, single strains of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis, Clostridium difficile and Eubacterium rectale were resistant to these drugs. With regard to its in vitro activity, tinidazole seems to be a promising substance for the therapy of anaerobic infections.
TI  - [Anaerobic effect of tinidazol compared with metronidazol, ornidazol, cefoxitin and lamoxactam].
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory activity of tinidazole, metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and moxalactam was determined against 150 isolates of clinically important anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius and Clostridium perfringens by means of agar dilution tests. The members of 18 gramnegative and 14 grampositive species were inhibited by tinidazole at less than or equal to 0,01-8 micrograms/ml thus being without exception susceptible to the drug. A similar in vitro activity was recorded for metronidazole and ornidazole. Though cefoxitin and moxalactam generally had a good in vitro activity against most anaerobic species, single strains of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis, Clostridium difficile and Eubacterium rectale were resistant to these drugs. With regard to its in vitro activity, tinidazole seems to be a promising substance for the therapy of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - Teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and Gram-positive anaerobes (Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and Cl. difficile). Ninety per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of Staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. Vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. Multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. Teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for Str. faecalis. In mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. It was very effective in curing experimental mouse septicemias caused by Gram-positive bacteria (ED50 values less than 1 mg/kg).
TI  - Studies on the beta-glucuronidase production of Clostridia.
AB  - We investigated the beta-glucuronidase-producing capacity of 197 strains of 19 different species of Clostridia, using the procedure described by Kilian and Bulow (8). Most of the Hobbs' serotyped strains of Clostridium perfringens (104 out of 109 strains) were found to produce beta-glucuronidase, whereas non-serotyped strains (21 out of 32 strains) did not. Some strains of other species such as Clostridium beijerinckii (C. beijerinckii), C. clostridiforme, C. difficile, C. limosum, and C. ramosum were found to produce beta-glucuronidase, while all strains of 13 other species which we examined did not.
TI  - Development of gut colonisation in pre-term neonates.
AB  - Twenty-eight pre-term babies of low birth weight were monitored for developing microflora in throat, stomach and faeces during the first 3 weeks of life. The flora at all levels of the gastrointestinal tract differed from that of healthy breast-fed and artificially fed full-term babies. Colonisation of throat and stomach was delayed beyond 4 days of life in 87% and 60% of babies respectively. Only 10% of babies had "normal" oral flora throughout the period of study. Flora of the stomach was sparse, and resembled faecal flora. Faecal flora was established more rapidly than throat or stomach flora, and 70% of babies were colonised during the first 4 days of life. Initially Bacteroides spp. were predominant (57% babies), but Escherichia coli and other aerobic gram-negative bacilli gradually increased in frequency. Colonisation by gram-positive bacteria was slow. Clostridium spp. were present in only 10% of babies during the first 4 days of life. Most strains were transient. Colonisation with C. butyricum (30%), C. perfringens (35%) and C. difficile (25%) was maximum after the first 2 weeks of life. Lactic-acid-producing bacteria usually appeared late in the third week of life. Parenteral feeding immediately after birth was associated with delayed colonisation by a restricted number of species. Parenteral antibiotics (penicillin or gentamicin or both) restricted colonisation with normal oral flora, the lactic-acid-producing bacteria and penicillin-sensitive clostridia, but had little effect on E. coli even when the colonising strain was sensitive to the aminoglycoside in the regimen. Systemic spread of bacteria via the blood stream was not detected in any babies. The pattern of colonisation of the enteric tract in pre-term infants in the special-care nursery studied, differs from that of healthy full-term babies; this merits consideration when the results of bacteriological tests of this vulnerable group of infants are being interpreted.
TI  - Implication of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens iota toxins in experimental lincomycin-associated colitis of rabbits.
AB  - Following oral administration of lincomycin, over 50% of two groups of 12 rabbits each died between 4 and 56 days with distended, non-hemorrhagic, fluid-filled ceca. Bacteria-free cecal filtrates from the rabbits that died were lethal for mice, cytopathic in Y-1 tissue culture monolayers, and caused increased vascular permeability in rabbit skin. Although the cecal filtrates of both groups had similar biological activity, the filtrate activity of one group was neutralized by Clostridium perfringens iota antitoxin, and the infiltrate activity of the other group was neutralized by Clostridium difficile antitoxin. Toxigenic Clostridium difficile also were isolated from the ceca of this group. A broth filtrate of a Clostridium difficile culture was lethal for rabbits when injected intravenously and intraperitoneally. The data indicated Clostridium difficile toxin or clostridium perfringens iota toxin may be associated with lincomycin-associated colitis in rabbits.
TI  - Clostridia isolated from the feces of infants during the first year of life.
AB  - Clostridia isolated from the feces of ten healthy infants during the first year of life were identified. All infants excreted clostridia during the first week of life; the most common species were Clostridium butyricum, C. paraputrificum, and C. difficile. In the formula-fed infants colonization occurred consistently throughout the year, whereas in some breast-fed infants it was inhibited until weaning. The species isolated most frequently throughout the year were C. paraputrificum, C. butyricum, C. ramosum, C. sartagoformum, and C. perfringens. Of the species often found in infants, C. butyricum, C. difficile, and C. sartagoformum occur rarely in adults, reflecting differences in the environmental conditions in the gut of the two age groups. The mechanism by which environmental conditions select species of clostridia is unknown but may be important to our understanding of a variety of clostridial intestinal infections. It was demonstrated that species of clostridia which have been implicated in the etiology of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis form part of the normal infant gastrointestinal microflora.
TI  - The bacterial flora of neonates with congenital abnormalities of the gastro-intestinal tract.
AB  - The development of the bacterial flora of neonates with congenital abnormalities  of the gastro-intestinal tract was studied in 31 infants during the first 10 days of life. Specimens were collected from the umbilicus, mouth and gastro-intestinal tract on the pre-operative day, at operation and on post-operative days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. Bacteria were isolated semi-quantitatively on a variety of plain and selective media and identified by conventional methods.Staphylococcus albus was the predominant species isolated from the umbilicus; it was recovered from 24 of the 31 babies. The viridans group of streptococci and Streptococcus salivarius were the commonest species isolated from the mouth; there were no differences between the babies with different abnormalities and treatment with antibiotics had no effect on the bacterial flora. Ten babies were colonized by each species on the pre-operative day, and 25 and 19 respectively by the tenth post-operative day. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were the predominant oral anaerobes. Bacteria were not isolated from the rectal swabs of babies with tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF) or small bowel atresia on the pre-operative days. Post-operatively the predominant faecal isolates from babies with TOF were Str. faecalis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens. About 80% of the babies with small bowel atresia were colonized by Str. faecalis and Bacteroides vulgatus, 60% each by E. coli, Klebsiella aerogenes and Str. faecium. The five babies with necrotizing enterocolitis were colonized by Str. faecalis, E. coli, Cl. perfringens and Cl. difficile; Bacteroides spp. were not recovered from any of them. The commonest facultative species recovered from babies with large bowel obstruction were Str. faecalis and E. coli. B. vulgatus, Cl. perfringens and Bifidobacterium spp. were the commonest anaerobes and anaerobes outnumbered aerobes. No significant isolates were recovered from the wound swabs and none of the babies developed post-surgical sepsis.
TI  - Toxigenic Clostridium perfringens from a parvovirus-infected dog.
AB  - A strain of Clostridium perfringens, type A, has been isolated from the intestine of a dog which died from parvovirus infection. This Clostridium strain produces a toxin which can be detected by counterimmunoelectrophoresis, using C. difficile antitoxin, and produces cytotoxicity in WI-38 cell culture. Cytopathology can be blocked by C. difficile antitoxin. Its role in canine parvovirus infection is unknown.
TI  - [Differentiation of pathogenic clostridia from material collected in the field and of reference strains by means of biostatistical analysis of the quantitatively recorded metabolic fatty acid patterns of the agents (author's transl)].
AB  - 34 reference and 9 exotic field strains of clostridia were analyzed by means of gas liquid chromatography (GLC) on their patterns of metabolic short chain fatty acids. To increase the number of criteria for the differentiation specimens were grown on pepton yeast medium with addition of 13 different carbohydrates and alcohols. Data of sequence and mean square space of GLC-peaks were stored in a data bank. With the SPSS discriminance analytical system the field strains were compared with the reference strains in order to classify field to reference strains. At the same time differences between reference strains of different origin were determined. C. novyi, C. histolyticum., C. sordellii, C. difficile, C. subterminale and C. sporogenes could be separated clearly from the C. chauvoei-, C. septicum- and the perfringens-group. Between different strains of C. chauvoei provided by several laboratories significant differences could be shown which make original classification doubtful. Similarities between the C. chauvoei- and the C. septicum-group do exist. Formerly C. perfringens type F is the sole type of C. perfringens which can be separated from the C. perfringens-group. There are similarities in fatty acid patterns between the C. chauvoei-, C. septicum-, and C. perfringens-group. Strains isolated from field cases of gas gangrene in Peru, Madagascar and Germany (Bavaria) were classified as completely different from the reference strains for Peru, partly similar to C. chauvoei for Madagascar, similar to C. chauvoei and C. septicum for Bavaria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of new beta-lactam antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Several new beta-lactam antimicrobial agents have been introduced in the last few years. In this investigation, the in vitro activities of several recently introduced cephalosporins (cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftizoxime), moxalactam, and N-formimidoyl thienamycin were compared with those of cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against 203 strains of anaerobic bacteria. At achievable serum levels, all of the antimicrobial agents were active against essentially 100% of the strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Clostridium perfringens, Leptotrichia buccalis, and species of Selenomonas, Veillonella, and Eubacterium. Clindamycin, metronidazole, and N-formimidoyl thienamycin were the most active agents against the Bacteroides fragilis group, inhibiting all strains at concentrations which can be achieved in serum. Of the remaining agents tested against the B. fragilis group, cefoxitin (which required 64 mug/ml to inhibit 90% of the strains) was the most active, followed by cefoperazone (128 mug/ml), cefotaxime (128 mug/ml), moxalactam (128 mug/ml), ceftizoxime (256 mug/ml), and ceftazidime (>256 mug/ml). Important differences in cephalosporin susceptibility among species of the B. fragilis group were observed. Metronidazole and N-formimidoyl thienamycin were the most active drugs against species of clostridia other than C. perfringens; the other antibiotics displayed poor activity, although this is partly due to inclusion of a relatively large number of strains of Clostridium difficile which were very resistant to several of the cephalosporins. Only metronidazole was active against all species of Fusobacterium. Clindamycin and N-formimidoyl thienamycin displayed excellent activity against gram-positive, non-spore-forming bacilli, requiring </=8 mug/ml to inhibit 100% of the strains. Ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and moxalactam were bactericidal for 25 strains of B. fragilis at concentrations equal or close to those required for inhibition. On the basis of its activity in vitro, N-formimidoyl thienamycin appears to be the most promising of the new beta-lactam antibiotics for the treatment of infections involving anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [Transferable tetracycline resistance in "Clostridium difficile" (author's transl)].
AB  - Tetracycline (Tc) resistance is transferable from a resistant strain of Clostridium difficile to a sensitive strain and this resistance is not curable. Resistances to erythromycin and clindamycin are curable but not transferable. These results suggest for these resistances a plasmid determinism. It is shown that a plasmid-mediated Tc resistance (pIP401) of C. perfringens is also transferable to C. difficile. Tc resistance is inducible in C. perfringens and constitutively expressed in C. difficile. In the Tc-resistant transcipients of C. difficile this resistance is either inducible or constitutive, whether the Tc-resistant donor strain was C. perfringens or C. difficile.
TI  - Experimental reproduction of neonatal diarrhea in young gnotobiotic hares simultaneously associated with Clostridium difficile and other Clostridium strains.
AB  - Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, and C. tertium are very often present simultaneously in the feces of conventional diarrheic young hares, whereas these three bacterial species are rarely encountered and never present simultaneously in the feces of healthy young hares. When a strain of each of the three bacterial species was monoassociated with axenic young hares, the appearance of pathological disorders was only observed in animals monoassociated with C. difficile, when the number of C. difficile exceeded 10(8) per g of fresh feces. When a strain of C. perfringens or a strain of C. tertium, or both, was associated with C. difficile, diarrhea and death occurred more rapidly than in hares monoassociated with C. difficile. C. difficile and C. perfringens became established more rapidly when disassociated than when monoassociated with axenic hares. The association of C. perfringens and C. tertium with axenic hares did not bring about any pathological disorders. It may be concluded that C. difficile is the causal agent of neonatal diarrhea in conventional and gnotobiotic young hares and that other strains of Clostridium enhance its pathogenic effect. C difficile alone or associated with C. perfringens or C. tertium does not play any pathogenic role in young rats, mice, or rabbits.
TI  - Aetiology of antimicrobial-agent-associated colitis.
AB  - Clostridium difficile was isolated from the faeces of a patient with clindamycin-associated pseudomembranous colitis (P.M.C.). The presence of a preformed faecal toxin and the toxigenicity of both the faecal isolate of C. difficile and a reference strain of C. difficile were demonstrated by tissue-culture assay. The toxin of both strains of C. difficile and that in the patient's faeces were neutralised by heating and by incubation with antitoxin to C. sordellii, but not by incubation with antitoxin to C. histolyticum, C. oedematiens (novyi), C. welchii (C. perfringens) or C. septicum. These data implicate the toxin of C. difficile as a major, and perhaps the sole, cause of antimicrobial-agent-associated P.M.C. of man and suggest that the neutralisation of the faecal toxin of P.M.C. by C. sordellii antitoxin, as described by other investigators, may be a non-specific phenomenon.
TI  - Competitive effects of intestinal microflora on Vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The coexistence of Vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. The bacteria tested included a Bacteroides sp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens type A, 2 separate isolates of Escherichia coli, 2 different Lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus faecalis. Each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. No single strain or species was found that would eliminate V cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. Not until a combination of E coli, P mirabilis, and S faecalis was present in the mice did V cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.
