TI  == determining the role of a probiotic in the restoration of intestinal microbial balance by molecular and cultural techniques.
AB  == the human intestine has a vast variety of microorganisms, and their balance is dependent on several factors. antibiotics affect microfloral balance and allow naturally opportunistic organisms to multiply. azithromycin is the most widely used macrolide antibiotic, active against a wide number of pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. it is currently used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. the use of probiotics has advantages in gastrointestinal conditions, including infectious diarrhea and imbalance due to antibiotic use. in this research, the effect of azithromycin on the intestinal microbiota of sprague dawley rats and the role of lactobacillus acidophilus in the restoration of the balance by employing molecular and cultural techniques was investigated. pcr with universal primers targeting the v3 region of the 16s rrna  gene followed by dgge was used to characterize the overall intestinal microbiota  composition. cultivable fecal bacteria count using microbiological media and semi-quantitative pcr with group-specific primers were also utilized to analyze the effects of antibiotic and probiotic on microflora. we found that the total amount of 16s rrna gene and fecal aerobic bacterial count was reduced following azithromycin administration along with elimination of non-pathogenic escherichia  coli, but it was restored by the use of the probiotic. the results from pcr with  group-specific primers showed that bacteroides sp was present in the control and  probiotic groups, but it was nearly eliminated in the antibiotic group. moreover, semi-quantitative pcr revealed that the numbers of enterobacteriaceae were nearly the same in the probiotic group and decreased in the antibiotic group, while bifidobacterium was significantly increased in the probiotic group and decreased  in the antibiotic group (p < 0.05) as compared with that in the control group. azithromycin-induced dysbiosis can result in prolonged deleterious effects on the host. the present study revealed that the use of lactic acid bacteria particularly l. acidophilus helped to restore intestinal microfloral balance.

TI  == pre-treatment with probiotics prolongs survival after experimental infection by multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in rodents: an effect on sepsis-induced immunosuppression.
AB  == based on several randomised clinical studies indicating benefit from oral probiotic intake for the prevention of hospital-acquired infections in critically ill patients, this study aimed to explain the mechanism of action of probiotics for the prevention of lethal experimental infection by multidrug-resistant (mdr)  pseudomonas aeruginosa. experiments using an escherichia coli strain susceptible  to all antimicrobials were also conducted. c57bl/6 mice were pre-treated intraperitoneally with sterile water for injection or lactobacillus plantarum. survival was recorded and mice were sacrificed for measurement of apoptosis and tissue bacterial overgrowth and for isolation and culture of splenocytes for cytokine production. experiments were repeated after pre-treatment with a commercial preparation of four probiotics (l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, saccharomyces boulardii and bifidobacterium lactis; lactolevure((r))). peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy volunteers were stimulated by heat-killed p. aeruginosa following pre-treatment with medium or probiotics. pre-treatment with l. plantarum significantly prolonged survival after challenge by either mdr p. aeruginosa (66.7% vs. 31.3%;  p=0.026) or e. coli (56.0% vs. 12.0%, p=0.003). survival benefit was even more pronounced when mice were pre-treated with lactolevure((r)). tissue bacterial outgrowth and apoptosis of white blood cells and splenocytes were not altered. tnfalpha and il-10 production by splenocytes of mice pre-treated with probiotic was increased and ifngamma production was decreased. pre-treatment with lactolevure((r)) restored production of il-17. stimulation of human pbmcs after probiotic pre-treatment was accompanied by reduced gene expression of socs3. the  results suggest that the protective effect of probiotics is mediated through prevention of sepsis-induced immunosuppression.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == abcb1 (p-glycoprotein) reduces bacterial attachment to human gastrointestinal ls174t epithelial cells.
AB  == the aim of this project was to show elevated p-glycoprotein (p-gp) expression decreasing bacterial association with ls174t human gastrointestinal cells, and that this effect could be reversed upon blocking functional p-gp efflux. staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, lactobacillus acidophilus and numerous strains of escherichia coli, from commensal to enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic strains (o157:h7) were fluorescently labelled and incubated on ls174t cultures either with or without p-gp amplification using rifampicin. psc-833 was used as a potent functional p-gp blocking agent. staphylococcus and pseudomonas displayed the greatest association with the ls174t cells. surprisingly, lactobacilli retained more fluorescence than enteropathogenic-e. coli in this system. irrespective of attachment differences between the bacterial species, the increase in p-gp protein expression decreased  bacterial fluorescence by 25-30%. this included the gfp-labelled e. coli, and enterohaemorrhagic e. coli (o157:h7). blocking p-gp function through the co-administration of psc-833 increased the amount of bacteria associated with p-gp expressing ls174t cells back to control levels. as most bacteria were affected to the same degree, irrespective of pathogenicity, it is unlikely that p-gp has a direct influence on adhesion of bacteria, and instead p-gp may be playing an indirect role by secreting a bank of endogenous factors or changing the local environment to one less suited to bacterial growth in general.

TI  == caenorhabditis elegans immune conditioning with the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus strain ncfm enhances gram-positive immune responses.
AB  == although the immune response of caenorhabditis elegans to microbial infections is well established, very little is known about the effects of health-promoting probiotic bacteria on evolutionarily conserved c. elegans host responses. we found that the probiotic gram-positive bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm is not harmful to c. elegans and that l. acidophilus ncfm is unable to colonize the c. elegans intestine. conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm significantly decreased the burden of a subsequent enterococcus faecalis infection in the nematode intestine and prolonged the survival of nematodes exposed to pathogenic  strains of e. faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, including multidrug-resistant (mdr) isolates. preexposure of nematodes to bacillus subtilis did not provide any beneficial effects. importantly, l. acidophilus ncfm activates key immune signaling pathways involved in c. elegans defenses against gram-positive bacteria, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (via tir-1 and pmk-1) and the beta-catenin signaling pathway (via bar-1). interestingly, conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm had a minimal effect on gram-negative infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa or salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  and had no or a negative effect on defense genes associated with gram-negative pathogens or general stress. in conclusion, we describe a new system for the study of probiotic immune agents and our findings demonstrate that probiotic conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm modulates specific c. elegans immunity traits.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of different lactobacillus species against multi- drug resistant clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == background: lactobacilli are the well known friendly bacteria for their probiotic activities against pathogens. the inhibitory activity of different strains of lactobacilli either obtained as commercial products or isolated from human feces  was investigated against the clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the isolates were selected as the most resistant strains when challenged with anti-pseudomonal antibiotics already in clinical practice. materials and methods: both the plate spot test as well as the agar cup method were used for screening of lactobacillus strains against pseudomonas aeruginosa. results: a lactobacillus acidophilus strain isolated from feces of an iranian child showed a strong anti-pseudomonal activity (90 percent after 72h incubation) against the multi-drug resistant clinical isolates while a lactobacillus reuteri strain isolated from a commercial oral product resulted in relatively weak response and  a lactobacillus acidophilus strain isolated from a commercial vaginal product did not show any inhibitory activity. in a kinetic study the lactobacillus sensitive  pseudomonas aeruginosa showed a significant bacteriostatic activity in vitro in the presence of lactobacillus supernatants. conclusion: some lactobacilli exhibit significant inhibitory activity against the multidrug resistant clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == therapeutic efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus against bacterial isolates from burn wounds.
AB  == background: probiotics are live microorganisms which are mainly strains of lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp. when administered in adequate amounts, these microorganisms offer a health benefit for the host. probiotic organisms are also available commercially in milk, sour milk, ice cream and other foods. aims:  to identify bacterial species isolated from burn wounds, and also to evaluate (in-vitro) the therapeutic efficacy of lacto. acidophilus against these bacterial isolates. to compare this activity to other antibacterial agents which are used medically in the treatment of burn wound cases. materials and methods: burn wound swabs were obtained from 50 patients who had been admitted to hospitals in baghdad during august to november 2009. these swabs were inoculated onto enriched and differential culture media. subcultures were performed on selective media. the necessary biochemical tests were conducted and the organisms identified using standard procedures. susceptibility of isolated pathogens to local isolates lacto. acidophilus (with 1x10(8) cells/ml) and 10 commonly used burn wounds antibiotics was examined using standard susceptibility testing. results: ninety different organisms were isolated. gram-positive cocci accounted for 16 (17.7%) and gram-negative bacilli for 74 (82.2%) bacterial isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa 30(33.3%) were the most commonly isolated organisms, followed by escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., klebsiella spp., proteus spp.(22.2,20,4.4,2.2%), respectively. staphylococcus aureus isolates were performed in 8(8.8%). however, the incidence of staphylococcus epidermidis was 2  (2.2%), while ss-haemolytic streptococci was 4(4.4%). in susceptibility testing,  lacto. acidophilus had coverage against 90 (100%) of 74 gram-negative and 16 of gram-positive bacteria tested. the coverage of the remaining 10 antibacterial agents used was different in their activity (resistance or sensitivity), which ranged between 50-100%. conclusion: the results of the study concluded that lactobacillus acidophilus concentration of 1x10(8) cells/ml had a high activity to inhibit the growth in-vitro of all pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria, which cause burn wound infections. this indicated the therapeutic efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria.

TI  == [probiotic properties of industrial strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria].
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from the samples of dry microbial substance "vivolac" and identified. the lactic acid bacteria were identified as lactobacillus acidophilus. l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. paracasei. bifidobacteria belonged to the species bifidobacterium animalis. manifestation of biological activity of all studied strains was investigated. it  was shown, that adhesive activity of the studied strains depended on the genus of the strain: lactobacilli manifested medium adhesiveness to buccal epithelium (medium adhesive index 2.07-2.26), bifidobacteria manifested high adhesiveness (medium adhesive index 4.11-4.76). antagonism against pathogenic and opportunistic reference strains was manifested to a greater extent to pseudomonas aeruginosa. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were resistant to aminoglycosides. sensitivity of the studied strains to antibiotics did not depend on the genus and species of microorganism. lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains were capable  to survive in gastric juice and at different concentration of bile, which is promising for development of probiotic preparations on the basis of these strains.

TI  == characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
AB  == lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of  7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins,  amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen  pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

AB  == the ability of the lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. a parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. although the initial deposition rates of the two candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.

TI  == the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells (m. f. bernet, d. brassard, j. r. neeser, and a. l. servin, gut 35:483-489, 1994). here, we demonstrate that strain la1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected  by salmonella typhimurium. we present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain la1 (la1-scs) contained antibacterial components active against s. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. by contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.

TI  == antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
AB  == the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed  as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  == neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3)  cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by  the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated  the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of  foods.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus casei on pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in normal and  dexamethasone-treated mice.
AB  == a single intraperitoneal injection of lactobacillus casei yit 0003 into normal or dexamethasone-treated mice led to nonspecific resistance against intraperitoneal  challenge with lethal doses of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao 3047. the enhanced resistance was retained for 14 days (p less than 0.05) after injection with living l. casei. in contrast, the statistically significant duration of the enhanced resistance in mice treated intraperitoneally with living l. acidophilus  yit 0075 was only 5 days. the in vivo killing activity of peritoneal exudate cells (pecs) against p. aeruginosa 5 and 7 days after intraperitoneal injection of living l. casei was significantly higher than in the case of pecs elicited by  l. acidophilus. in the case of intravenous injection of heat-killed l. casei before intraperitoneal challenge with p. aeruginosa, there were no survivors in the late period after administration of l. casei. a high correlation existed between the patterns of in vivo killing of p. aeruginosa by pecs and survival rate of mice injected intravenously with heat-killed l. casei. the reduced in vivo killing activity of pecs from dexamethasone-treated mice against p. aeruginosa infection was also augmented by the intraperitoneal injection of heat-killed l. casei. these results indicate that l. casei possesses a resistance-enhancing capacity against p. aeruginosa infection in vivo. differences in the duration of the enhanced resistance caused by l. casei and by  l. acidophilus may be due to differences in chemical composition and/or physicochemical properties of the cell walls of the two kinds of bacteria.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and physico-chemical properties of some alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chlorides.
AB  == a series of alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chlorides have been synthesized with n-alkyl chain lengths of c1 leads to c18. octanol/water partition coefficients were determined and the antimicrobial activity assessed as the minimum growth inhibitory concentrations towards twelve strains of micro-organisms, representative of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and fungi. the data were subjected to a numerical analysis. antimicrobial activity of the compounds was found to be a parabolic function of their lipophilicity and maximized with n-alkyl chain lengths of between c12 and c16. the data fit to quadratic functions estimated for low (c1-c7) and high (c8-c16) alkyl chain length compounds was better than for a single quadratic describing the activity of the complete series (c1-c18). these maximized at log p values corresponding to alkyl-chain lengths of approximately c7 and c14 respectively, and were suggestive of low and high affinity binding sites upon the cell surface. the data analysis allowed the chain lengths of compounds with optimal activity towards the various  groups of organisms to be determined. generally yeasts and fungi were most sensitive towards c12, gram-positive bacteria towards c14, and the gram-negative  bacteria towards c16. gram-negative cells were the most resistant towards all the compounds and gram-positive cells the least.

TI  == deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus  (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was  intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all  of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of  the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.

TI  == serum proteins of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == cellulose-acetate and agar gel immunoelectrophoresis were used to study the serum protein patterns of germfree rats before and after monoassociation with a pure culture of staphylococcus aureus (phage type 80/81), streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or proteus vulgaris. all six bacteria quickly established themselves in the gastrointestinal tract of the germfree rat, and all six increased the animals' total serum proteins. only s. aureus and p. aeruginosa caused a noticeable rise in gamma globulins. l. acidophilus, s. faecalis, and b. fragilis multiplied readily in the gastrointestinal tract but caused only minimal alterations in the  serum proteins. p. vulgaris caused a marked increase in the alpha and beta, but not the gamma globulins.

TI  == microstructure of colonies of rod-shaped bacteria.
AB  == whole colonies of bacillus cereus, b. megaterium, b. mycoides cn2495, corynebacterium hofmanni nctc1938, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus ncib1899, nocardia graminis nctc4728, pseudomonas viscosa, and serratia marcescens were prepared for scanning electron microscopic examination by freeze-drying and metal-coating. the arrangement of individual cells within colonies could be seen. cells of bacillus colonies tended to be longer than in liquid culture and irregular in shape and to give the appearance of branching. b. megaterium colonies frequently had a dense covering film. colonies of gram-negative bacteria consisted of fairly short rods covered by much adherent extracellular material. l. acidophilus had colonies comprised of densely packed,  well-oriented rods. c. hofmanni colonies contained coccobacilli, packed together. correlations were observed between plano-convex colony form and densely packed cells, rough colony form and random arrangement of well-separated microorganisms, and irregular colony edge and tendency of cells to grow out from the colony in filaments.

TI  == antimicrobial action of nitrogen-containing steroids.
AB  == smith, rodney f. (university of maryland, baltimore), donald e. shay, and norman  j. doorenbos. antimicrobial action of nitrogen-containing steroids. j. bacteriol. 85:1295-1299. 1963.-a new group of 16 synthetic nitrogen-containing steroids have been tested against a variety of microorganisms for antimicrobial properties. the gradient plate screening method, serial dilution, and dry weight techniques were  used in the studies. the organisms tested consisted of 14 gram-negative bacteria, 10 gram-positive bacteria, 2 actinomycetes, 7 yeasts, and 8 molds. inhibitory properties were found to be specific and potent in four compounds, with inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.37 mug/ml. three of the active steroids are 4-aza cholestanes and one is a 4-nor-3,5-secocholestane amide. sensitivity to the compounds was greatest in the gram-positive bacteria, followed by the yeasts and  molds. the gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. all 16 steroids interfered  to some extent with pigmentation in serratia marcescens but not with pigment production in pseudomonas aeruginosa. in a few instances, some of the molds were  stimulated by the steroids at a concentration of 250 mug/ml.
