design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides as potent gram-positive antibacterial agents.
twelve 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides have been tested as potential antibacterials. all the compounds had mics between 0.49 and 15.63 microg/ml toward micrococcus luteus, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus epidermidis indicating, in most cases, equipotent or even more effective action than cefuroxime. in order to clarify if the observed antibacterial effects are universal, further research were undertaken to test inhibitory potency of two most potent compounds 3 and 11 on clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus. compound 11 inhibited the growth of methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) at mics of 1.95-7.81 microg/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) at mics of 0.49-1.95 microg/ml and mdr-mrsa at mic of 0.98 and 3.90 microg/ml, respectively. finally, inhibitory efficacy of 3 and 11 on planktonic cells and biofilms formation in clinical isolates of s. aureus and haemophilus parainfluenzae was tested. the majority of cells in biofilm populations of mssa and mrsa were eradicated at low level of 3, with mbics in the range of 7.82-15.63 microg/ml.
green tea extract: possible mechanism and antibacterial activity on skin pathogens.
camellia sinensis (tea) is known for its therapeutic properties (anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-tumour, anti-oxidative and anti-ageing). although, anti-microbial properties of green tea have been studied, its role against bacterial strains related to skin infections and mechanism of action is not well understood. we focussed on exploring anti-microbial activity and the basic mechanism of aqueous green tea leaf extract on selected bacterial strains. staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, brevibacterium linens, pseudomonas fluorescens and bacillus subtilis were found to be sensitive to green tea extract via disc diffusion assay (zone of inhibition >/=7 mm). minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined via nitro blue tetrazolium (nbt) assay (0.156-0.313 mg/ml). moreover, the aqueous extract was found to be not toxic to the vero cell-line up to a concentration of 500 mug/ml. the effect of aqueous extract on adhesion of different bacteria to vero cells indicated that it inhibits the adhesion at its mic value.
essential oil from the underground parts of laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
the composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of laserpitium zernyi hayek (apiaceae) were investigated. the pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by gc and gc-ms. forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). the main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. the antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against gram (+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis), gram (-) bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (candida albicans). l. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against s. epidermidis, s. aureus and m. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
antimicrobial studies on three species of hypericum from the canary islands.
the antimicrobial activity of several extracts and fractions of the aerial parts  of hypericum canariense, hypericum glandulosum and hypericum grandifolium was investigated using the disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods against twelve reference microorganisms (eight bacterial and four fungal strains). the methanol extract and chloroform fraction of h. canariense, as well as the methanol extracts, butanol and chloroform fractions of both h. glandulosum and h. grandifolium exhibited a good antibacterial activity against four gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus var. mycoides, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis) and the gram-negative bacterium bordetella bronchiseptica with the diameters of growth inhibition area in the range 10-25 mm and mics values between 0.03 and 0.29 mg/ml. neither the infusions and aqueous fractions of the species studied nor the butanol fraction of h. canariense showed any antibacterial activity against the tested microorganisms. amongst the active extracts, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determination showed that the h. canariense chloroform fraction was the most active against m. luteus, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. no antifungal activity was seen with any of the extracts or fractions tested. the results of this study support the use of these species in canarian traditional medicine to treat skin infections.
antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol isolated from magnolia officinalis.
the antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of magnolia officinalis was investigated. the antimicrobial activity was assayed by the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were determined for each compound using a twofold serial dilution assay. the results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (mic = 25 microg/ml) against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (mic > or = 100 microg/ml) for shigella flexneii, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.
antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
