TI  == detection of the tetm determinant in neisseria gonorrhoeae using a non-radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe.
AB  == three oligonucleotide probes, complementary to tetm sequences, were labelled non-radiometrically using the dig-oligonucleotide tailing kit and evaluated for their specificity for the detection of plasmid mediated tetracycline resistance in neisseria gonorrhoeae. only probe 3, 5'-gct caa caa ttc tgt tcc agc-3', was specific for tetm. it hybridized with the tetm-containing 25.2-mda plasmids from  all of the 232 trng and the 130 pp/trng isolates used in the study. its sensitivity, determined by dot-blot hybridization, was 0.1 pg of pj13 plasmid dna or 10(4) cells. it did not hybridize with the dna from non-ppng, cmrng and tetracycline susceptible isolates from seven other neisseria species (n. meningitidis, n. subflava, n. cinerea, n. lactamica, n. sicca, n. mucosa, and n.  flavescens), moraxella spp. and haemophilus influenzae. probe 3 also hybridized to dna of three tetracycline resistant p. magnus (mic = 16 micrograms ml-1) isolates which presumptively carried the tetm determinant. therefore, probe 3 can be used by reference laboratories as a confirmatory test for trng, as well as isolates from other genera containing the tetm determinant.

TI  == the bacterial etiology of conjunctivitis in early infancy. eye prophylaxis study  group.
AB  == the authors conducted this study to determine the etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in early infancy. from 1985 to 1990, 630 infants enrolled in a randomized, controlled, double-masked study of eye prophylaxis were observed for  60 days after delivery for signs of conjunctivitis. the following isolates were categorized as pathogens: haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria cinerea, klebsiella pneumoniae, and chlamydia trachomatis. using conditional logistic regression for analysis of 97 infant pairs, the authors identified isolates categorized as pathogens almost exclusively among cases (odds ratio (or) = 18.0, 95% confidence interval (ci) 2.3-128). among the microorganisms which have not usually been regarded as pathogens in the etiology  of infant conjunctivitis, streptococcus mitis was the only microorganism associated with an increased risk of conjunctivitis (or = 5.3, 95% ci 1.8-15.0).  the findings concerning the species of bacteria most often associated with conjunctivitis, as well as the finding that method of delivery is unimportant, suggest that bacteria were transmitted to the infants' eyes after birth and not from the birth canal.

TI  == identification of neisseria spp., haemophilus spp., and other fastidious gram-negative bacteria with the microscan haemophilus-neisseria identification panel.
AB  == the haemophilus-neisseria identification (hnid) panel (american microscan, sacramento, calif.) is a 4-h microdilution format system for identification of haemophilus and neisseria spp., branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis, and gardnerella vaginalis. the hnid panel was evaluated by using 423 clinical isolates and stock strains of these organisms, and hnid identifications were compared with those obtained by conventional methods. in addition, 32 isolates representing six genera not included in the hnid data base were tested to determine whether these organisms would produce unique biotype numbers for possible inclusion in the data base. the hnid panel correctly identified 95.3% of 86 neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 96% of 25 g. vaginalis strains, and 100% of 28  neisseria lactamica strains and 48 b. catarrhalis strains. only 64.7% of 68 neisseria meningitidis isolates were identified correctly owing to false-negative or equivocal carbohydrate and/or aminopeptidase reactions. among the haemophilus  spp., 98.8% of 83 h. influenzae strains, 97.1% of 34 h. parainfluenzae strains, and 80% of 15 h. aphrophilus and h. paraphrophilus strains were correctly identified. eight strains of neisseria cinerea, a species not included in the data base, produced profiles identical with those for b. catarrhalis and n. gonorrhoeae. isolates of other species not included in the data base, including eikenella corrodens, kingella spp., and cardiobacterium hominis, produced unique  biochemical reaction patterns on the panel. modification of interpretative criteria for certain tests, expansion of the data base to include other species,  and suggestions for additional confirmatory tests will increase the accuracy and  utility of the hnid panel.
