TI  - [Infection pathogen analysis of 2388 patients in an open hematology ward from 1993 to 2004].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of infection and pathogens in hematology  ward. METHODS: The data of incidence, pathogen, and outcome of infection of 2388 hospitalized patients in an open hematology ward of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1993 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The overall incidence of infection was 34.3% according to the person-times of hospitalization, 24.4% for nosocomial infection and 9.9% for community-acquired infection. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infection were Gram negative. The most common bacteria in the sputum samples included Enterobacter (27%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRSCoN, 12%), the most common bacteria in the blood samples included Escherichia coli (43%), Enterobacter cloacae (11%), and Klebsiella (11%). Whereas in the community-acquired infection the most common bacteria in the sputum samples were Haemophilus parainfluenzae (15%), MRSCoN (28%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and the most common bacteria in the blood samples were MRSCoN (28%), E. coli (28%), and Klebsiella (9.4%). Fungi were more often found in nosocomial infection, especially in the sputum samples. 12-year follow up showed that in nosocomial infection Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained the most common bacteria in the sputum samples, whereas E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae became the major bacteria in the blood samples. In community-acquired infection, the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus, that of Klebsiella in blood samples, and that of E. coli in throat swab samples increased in recent years. The incidence of fungi infection had increased in both nosocomial infection and community acquired infection. The mortality of nosocomial infection was 6.1%, higher than that of the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant (P = 0.17). There was a trend of decrease in the mortality of community-acquired infection but did not in the nosocomial infection. CONCLUSION: The patients in hematology ward are susceptible to infection, especially nosocomial infection that has a higher mortality rate in comparison with the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant. The pathogens of nosocomial infection are most likely G- bacteria, fungi and other bacteria resistant to most antibiotics. The mortality rate of nosocomial infection remains almost unchanged in the 12-year follow up.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (FOM) and Citrobacter freundii. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (MINO). While Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (CMZ). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-negative bacilli. However, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST), CMZ, latamoxef (LMOX), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK) showed good activities against some of the Gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. In conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
TI  - Sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, comparative study. Sparfloxacin Multicenter ABECB Study Group.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Comparison of efficacy and safety of sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin for treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB). DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized study. SETTING: Sixty-eight private offices and outpatient clinics in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Seven hundred ninety-eight adults with ABECB, as confirmed by the acute onset of new (or worsened from the immediate premorbid state) cough and sputum production. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization 1:1 to sparfloxacin, 400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg once daily, or ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily, with matching comparator placebos, given concurrently for 10 consecutive days. RESULTS: The primary efficacy parameter was overall response in the bacteriologically evaluable population. Overall success rates in this population were 85.3% and 89.3% for sparfloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. The two-sided 95% confidence interval was -9.9, 1.9, indicating that sparfloxacin was statistically equivalent to ofloxacin. The all-treated population analysis was similar to that in the evaluable population. Bacterial eradication rates were similar in both treatment groups for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of adverse events overall was comparable in the two treatment groups. The sparfloxacin group had a lower frequency of digestive and nervous system adverse events, but a higher frequency of photosensitivity reactions than the ofloxacin group. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily oral treatment with 200 mg sparfloxacin (after initial 400 mg dose) is as effective as twice-daily treatment with 400 mg ofloxacin in patients with ABECB.
TI  - [Clinical experience with cefodizime in bacterial infection of children].
AB  - Clinical studies were performed on cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a new cephem antibiotic as described below. CDZM was administered to 13 patients in dose levels ranging from 55 to 96 mg/kg/day t.i.d. for 3-7 days (5.5 days on average). These patients included 8 with pneumonia, 2 with tonsillitis, 1 each with bronchitis, phlegmon and urinary tract infection. The overall efficacy rate was 92.3%, i.e., efficacy was excellent in 8, good in 4 and poor in 1. Bacteriological efficacy was 83.3%, i.e., 5 strains of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae 1, Haemophilus influenzae 3, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1) were eradicated and 1 was unchanged (Enterobacter cloacae, MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml). Clinical side effect was not observed during the treatment. Laboratory abnormalities were observed in 2 cases, i.e., a slight elevation of GPT and a mild eosinophilia. The above results suggest that CDZM is a useful antibiotic for treating pediatric bacterial infections.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of 6059-S therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  - A new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative, 6059-S, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Twenty-five patients were treated with 10 to 274 mg/kg per day of 6059-S by intravenous administrations. The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (2), pneumonia (4), pertussis (4), acute enterocolitis (2), recurrent urinary tract infection (2), suspected septicemia (3), and acute purulent meningitis (1); and the remaining 5 patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1), Enterobacter aerogenes (1), Proteus morganii (1), Psuedomonas aeruginosa (2) and Salmonella typhimurium (1). All the patients of bacterial infections were cured after the 6059-S therapy. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium were not eradicated after the 6059-S therapy, and the rate of bacterial disappearance was 75%. Diarrhea (3), precordial pain (2, only in cases with high-dose therapy), transient elevation of GOT and GPT (2), and transient eosinophilia (2) were found to be associated with the 6059-S therapy. However, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. Half life of the serum 6059-S level was 1.34 +/- 0.16 hours. CSF concentrations in a case with Haemophilus influenzae meningitis ranged 4.0 to 9.7 mcg/ml after an intravenous injection of 34.3 to 75 mg/kg of 6059-S. From the present study, 6059-S appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections. It remains to be further determined whether 6059-S is superior to ABPC in the treatment of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis.
TI  - Evaluation of the four-hour Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, Gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  - A 4-h Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by API 20E and Micro-ID, using standardized inocula. A total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. Isolates included 96 Escherichia coli, 46 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Klebsiella oxytoca, 8 Enterobacter aerogenes, 17 Enterobacter cloacae, 19 Serratia marcescens, 2 Serratia liquefaciens, 8 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Salmonella species, 1 Morganella morganii, 6 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 Bacteroides fragilis, 3 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 Pseudomonas maltophilia. In 90% of the cultures, identification by Micro-ID was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. Enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct Micro-ID were three S. marcescens (two identified as S. liquefaciens, one as Hafnia alvei), two S. liquefaciens (both identified as E. cloacae), and two K. pneumoniae (one identified as Klebsiella ozaenae, the other as Serratia rubidaea). None of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by Micro-ID (non-identifiable, or classified as Providencia/Yersinia/Klebsiella species). Although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final Micro-ID tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. Direct species identification of Enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct Micro-ID is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct Micro-ID technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
