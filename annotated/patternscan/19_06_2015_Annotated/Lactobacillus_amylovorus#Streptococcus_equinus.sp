TI  == increased dietary zinc oxide changes the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the ileum of piglets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of increased dietary zno on the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the small intestine of piglets that were fed diets containing a total of 124 or 3,042 mg of zn per kilogram of diet, respectively. zinc was supplemented to the basal diet as zno. bacterial 16s rrna genes of ileal dna extracts were pcr-amplified with 2 bar-coded primer sets and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. the bacterial core species were calculated from the relative abundances of reads present in 5 of 6 samples per group and at a minimum of 5 sequences per sample. the reference database silva was used to assign sequence reads at an alignment minimum of 200 bases and 100% identity. lactic acid bacteria dominated the bacterial core, but showed diverse responses to dietary zno. of the dominant lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus reuteri was reduced due to increased dietary zno (44.7 vs. 17.9%; p=0.042), but l. amylovorus was not influenced. however, the changes of relative  abundances of other lactic acid bacteria were more noteworthy; weissella cibaria  (10.7 vs. 23.0%; p=0.006), w. confusa (10.0 vs. 22.4%; p=0.037), leuconostoc citreum (6.5 vs. 14.8%; p=0.009), streptococcus equinus (0.14 vs. 1.0%; p=0.044), and s. lutetiensis (0.01 vs. 0.11%; p=0.016) increased in relative abundance. nonlactic acid bacteria that were influenced by increased dietary zno included the strict anaerobic species, sarcina ventriculi, which showed a strong numerical decrease in relative abundance (14.6 vs. 5.1%). species of the enterobacteriaceae increased their relative abundance, as well as species diversity, in the high dietary zno experimental group. bacterial diversity indices were increased due to increased dietary zno (p < 0.05), which was traced back to the increase of sequences from subdominant species. increased dietary zno led to an increase of less prominent species and, thus, had a major impact on the bacterial composition and diversity in piglets. this effect may help to stabilize the intestinal microbiota in the sensitive postweaning period.

TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == the replicon of the cryptic plasmid psbo1 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1.
AB  == the cryptic plasmid psbo1 (3904 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. psbo1 contained an open reading frame (orf) that is homologous to sequences encoding the replication protein (rep) in pefc1 (isolated from enterococcus faecalis), psk639 (staphylococcus epidermidis), pla103 (lactobacillus acidophilus), and pucl287 (tetragenococcus halophila). in addition, four 22-bp direct repeats (drs) were located upstream of the putative replication gene (rep) of psbo1. recombinant plasmids (psbe10 and psbe11) containing the drs and putative rep of psbo1 replicated in s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8 strains. this result  indicates that the putative rep encoded rep and that the replicon of psbo1 contained the drs and the rep. gel shift assays showed that the rep of psbo1 bound the 22-bp drs.

TI  == in vitro effects of a thiopeptide and monensin on ruminal fermentation of soluble carbohydrates.
AB  == using a purified diet and a mixed culture of ruminal microorganisms, we studied the in vitro effects of a sulfur-containing peptide (a10255) and monensin on ruminal vfa and lactic acid concentrations. after 22 h of fermentation, total vfa concentration was greater in cultures with a10255 and monensin (2.5 ppm each) than in untreated controls (84.1, 91.9, and 65.2 mm for cultures with a10255, monensin, and control, respectively). the molar proportions of propionate were more than 40% greater, and the molar proportions of acetate were about 15% less,  in treated than in untreated cultures. the molar proportions of the remaining vfa were lowest in monensin-treated cultures, intermediate in a10255-treated cultures, and greatest in untreated cultures. addition of a10255 or monensin also prevented the accumulation of lactate and maintained higher ph than in untreated  cultures. in pure culture, growth of streptococcus bovis was slowed by a10255 at  ph 5.5 and 6.5. growth of s. bovis was reduced markedly with addition of monensin at ph 6.5 and inhibited at ph 5.5. growth of lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited more at ph 5.5 than 6.5 with monensin but was unaffected by a10255. the thiopeptide a10255 and monensin inhibited ruminal lactate production, but sensitivities of lactate-producing bacteria differed between compounds.

TI  == antimutagenicity of milk cultured with lactic acid bacteria against n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine.
AB  == the antimutagenic effect of cultured milk using 71 strains of lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus, and bifidobacterium on the mutagenicity of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine was investigated in vitro using salmonella typhimurium ta 100 as an indicator bacterium. each cultured milk sample displayed its characteristic antimutagenic effect on the mutagenicity of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine. the milk cultured with lactobacillus acidophilus la 106 (la2) showed the highest inhibition of 77% against the mutagenicity of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine among the strains tested. changes in the antimutagenic effect of the milk cultured by lb. acidophilus la 106 (la2) during  incubation were also examined using n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine as a mutagen.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.

TI  == bacteria associated with the gastric epithelium of neonatal pigs.
AB  == light and electron microscopy showed lactobacilli and, to a lesser degree, streptococci to be closely associated with the squamous area of the pig stomach known as the pars esophagea. several different types of extracellular layers were seen on bacteria attached to the epithelial surface. the total number of bacteria per square centimeter did not change with age up to 10 days, and there was no effect of weaning at 2 days. lactobacillus fermentum, l. salivarius, and streptococcus salivarius were isolated more frequently from sucking pigs than from those that were early weaned, whereas the reverse was true of l. acidophilus and s. bovis. all isolates recovered from washed macerated pars esophagea adhered to pig esophageal epithelial cells when tested in vitro.

TI  == changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  == the gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. although there was a significantly higher count of escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. there were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius, s. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. l. fermentum  and s. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. the weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there  may be gastric stasis. the gastric ph was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of  age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. in weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between ph and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and  also a positive correlation between ph and number of e. coli. these correlations  suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in  the regulation of gastric ph in weaned pigs. three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting hcl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, ph  < 3.5). in sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. in weaned scouring pigs there was  a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. there was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.
