TI  == colostrum of healthy slovenian mothers: microbiota composition and bacteriocin gene prevalence.
AB  == microbial communities inhabiting the breast milk microenvironment are essential in supporting mammary gland health in lactating women and in providing gut-colonizing bacterial 'inoculum' for their infants' gastro-intestinal development. bacterial dna was extracted from colostrum samples of 45 healthy slovenian mothers. characteristics of the communities in the samples were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) coupled with denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis (dgge) and by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). pcr screening for the prevalence of bacteriocin genes was performed on dna of culturable and total colostrum bacteria. dgge profiling revealed the presence of staphylococcus  and gemella in most of the samples and exposed 4 clusters based on the abundance  of 3 bands: staphylococcus epidermidis/gemella, streptococcus oralis/pneumonia and streptococcus salivarius. bacilli represented the largest proportion of the communities. high prevalence in samples at relatively low quantities was confirmed by qpcr for enterobacteria (100%), clostridia (95.6%), bacteroides-prevotella group (62.2%) and bifidobacteria (53.3%). bacterial quantities (genome equivalents ml-1) varied greatly among the samples; staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococci varied in the range of 4 logs, streptococci and all bacteria varied in the range of 2 logs, and other researched groups varied in the range of 1 log. the quantity of most bacterial groups was correlated with the amount of all bacteria. the majority of the genus staphylococcus was represented by the species staphylococcus epidermidis (on average 61%), and their abundances were linearly correlated. determinants of salivaricin a, salivaricin b, streptin and cytolysin were found in single samples. this work provides knowledge on the colostrum microbial community composition of healthy lactating slovenian mothers and reports bacteriocin gene prevalence.

TI  == infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking: a systematic review of reported cases: management, visual outcome, and treatment proposed.
AB  == abstract aim: to describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. methods: a medline (national library of medicine, bethesda, md, usa) search from october 2000 to october 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. nineteen articles were selected. ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in german, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. results: a total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. the infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus s. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (e. coli; p. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (fusarium and microsporidia) (20%),  and acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). conclusions: only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. the most virulent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa and acanthamoeba. less virulent organisms were escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. the most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.

TI  == nanoscopic vibrations of bacteria with different cell-wall properties adhering to surfaces under flow and static conditions.
AB  == bacteria adhering to surfaces demonstrate random, nanoscopic vibrations around their equilibrium positions. this paper compares vibrational amplitudes of bacteria adhering to glass. spring constants of the bond are derived from vibrational amplitudes and related to the electrophoretic softness of the cell surfaces and dissipation shifts measured upon bacterial adhesion in a quartz-crystal-microbalance (qcm-d). experiments were conducted with six bacterial strains with pairwise differences in cell surface characteristics. vibrational amplitudes were highest in low ionic strength suspensions. under fluid flow, vibrational amplitudes were lower in the direction of flow than perpendicular to it because stretching of cell surface polymers in the direction  of flow causes stiffening of the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium. under static conditions (0.57 mm), vibrational amplitudes of fibrillated streptococcus salivarius hb7 (145 nm) were higher than that of a bald mutant hb-c12 (76 nm). amplitudes of moderately extracellular polymeric substance (eps)  producing staphylococcus epidermidis atcc35983 (47 nm) were more than twice the amplitudes of strongly eps producing s. epidermidis atcc35984 (21 nm). no differences were found between staphylococcus aureus strains differing in membrane cross-linking. high vibrational amplitudes corresponded with low dissipation shifts in qcm-d. in streptococci, the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium is formed by fibrillar surface appendages and spring constants derived from vibrational amplitudes decreased with increasing fibrillar density. in staphylococci, eps constitutes the main network component, and larger amounts of eps yielded higher spring constants. spring constants increased with increasing ionic strength and strains with smaller electrophoretically derived bacterial cell surface softnesses possessed the highest spring constants.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == outbreak of bacterial meningitis among patients undergoing myelography at an outpatient radiology clinic.
AB  == purpose: to investigate an outbreak of bacterial meningitis at an outpatient radiology clinic (clinic a) and to determine the source and implement measures to prevent additional infections. methods: a case was defined as bacterial meningitis in a patient undergoing myelography at clinic a from october 11 to 25, 2010. patients who underwent myelography and other procedures at clinic a during  that period were interviewed, medical records were reviewed, and infection prevention practices were assessed. case-patient cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens, oral specimens from health care personnel (hcp), and opened iohexol vials were tested for bacteria. bacterial isolates were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. a culture-negative csf specimen was tested using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. results: three cases were identified among 35 clinic a patients who underwent procedures from october 11 to 25, 2010. all case-patients required hospitalization, 2 in an intensive care unit. case-patients had myelography performed by the same radiology physician assistant and technician on october 25; all patients who underwent myelography on october 25 were affected. hcp did not wear facemasks and reused single-dose iohexol vials for multiple patients. streptococcus salivarius (a bacteria commonly found in oral flora) was detected in the csf of 2 case-patients (1 by culture, 1 using real-time polymerase chain reaction) and in hcp oral specimens;  1 opened iohexol vial contained staphylococcus epidermidis. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles from the case-patient s salivarius and the radiology physician assistant were indistinguishable. conclusions: bacterial meningitis likely occurred because hcp performing myelography did not wear facemasks; lapses in injection practices may have contributed to transmission. targeted education regarding mask use and safe injection practices is needed among radiology hcp.

TI  == a multicentre prospective study of post-traumatic endophthalmitis.
AB  == purpose: study the clinical and microbiological characteristics and the prognostic factors of post-traumatic endophthalmitis. methods: seventeen eyes were included between 2004 and 2010, with clinical and microbiological data collected prospectively. conventional cultures and panbacterial pcr were performed on aqueous and vitreous samples. results: clinical signs of endophthalmitis were observed soon after trauma (1.5 +/- 2.5 days). laceration with an intraocular foreign body (iofb) was noted in 53% of the patients. at admission, all patients had aqueous humour (71%) and/or vitreous (53%) samples. fifteen patients (88%) underwent a pars plana vitrectomy. bacteria were identified in 77% of the cases: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), streptococcus (n = 4), bacillus (n = 2), pseudomonas stuzeri (n = 1), and streptococcus salivarius and gemella haemolysans (multibacterial infection, n = 1). progression toward phthisis was observed in 35% of the cases; 41% of the patients recuperated visual acuity (va) >/=20/40. a good final visual prognosis (>/=20/40) was significantly associated with initial va better than light perception (0% versus  70%, p = 0.01) and absence of pupillary fibrin membrane (80% versus 20%, p = 0.05). there was no correlation between visual prognosis and age, the type of laceration (corneal or scleral) or presence of an iofb. we found a statistical trend toward an association between bacterial virulence and poor final va. conclusion: this series showed that better final va outcomes were associated with initial va better than light perception, s. epidermidis or culture-negative cases and absence of retinal detachment during the clinical course.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

TI  == rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  == rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1h-xanthene-1,3(2h)-di-one] from rhodomyrtus tomentosa (aiton) hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus salivarius. especially noteworthy was the activity against mrsa with a minimum inhibitory concentration  (mic) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. as shown for s. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8mbc and 4mbc concentrations, respectively. rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. a rhodomyrtone killing test with s. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of nanocrystalline tetracalcium phosphate cements.
AB  == the antimicrobial properties of cements prepared from mechanically activated tetracalcium phosphate (mattcp) were tested with the agar diffusion test using streptococcus salivarius, staphylococcus epidermidis, and a clinically isolated plaque mixture. all mattcp cements showed a significantly higher antimicrobial potency as revealed by inhibition zones of approximately 3-5 mm width, compared with a commercial ca(oh)(2)//salicylate cement which only produced small inhibition zones around the cement specimens of 1.5 mm or less. this behavior was explained by the formation of amorphous ca(oh)(2) during setting of mattcp cements, which is thought to have a higher solubility and may release more oh(-)  ions than conventional ca(oh)(2)//salicylate cements. in fact, the ph value in the agar gel around the specimens was higher in the case of mattcp cements (7.8-8.7) compared with the ca(oh)(2)//salicylate control (7.0-8.0). the mattcp cements did not affect the photoactivation of resin-based composites, and their antimicrobial activity is making them interesting candidates for the use as pulp-capping agents, endodontic sealers, or cavity liners in dentistry.

TI  == interference in adhesion of bacteria and yeasts isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber by rhamnolipid biosurfactants.
AB  == aims: the effects and extent of adhesion of four different bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed rhamnolipid biosurfactant layer obtained from pseudomonasaeruginosa ds10-129 was studied. methods and results: the ability of rhamnolipid biosurfactant to inhibit adhesion of micro-organisms to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the anti-adhesive activity of the biosurfactant at different concentrations was significant against all the strains and depended on the micro-organism tested. the results showed an  effective reduction in the initial deposition rates, and the number of bacterial  cells adhering after 4 h, for all micro-organisms tested at the 4 g l(-1) undiluted rhamnolipid solution. maximum initial reduction of adhesion rate (an average of 66%) occurred for streptococcus salivarius gb 24/9 and candida tropicalis gb 9/9. the number of cells adhering after 4 h on silicone rubber conditioned with biosurfactant was reduced to 48% for staphylococcus epidermidis  gb 9/6, strep. salivarius gb 24/9, staphylococcus aureus gb 2/1 and c. tropicalis gb 9/9 in comparison to controls. perfusing the flow chamber with biosurfactant containing solution followed by the passage of a liquid-air interface, to investigate detachment of micro-organisms adhering to silicone rubber, produced high detachment (96%) of adhered cells for all micro-organisms studied, except for staph. aureus gb 2/1 (67%). significance and impact of the study: it is concluded that biosurfactant represent suitable compounds that should be considered in developing future strategies to prevent the microbial colonization  of silicone rubber voice prostheses.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == mechanisms of inhibition by fluoride of urease activities of cell suspensions and biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii and of dental plaque.
AB  == background/aims: fluoride is known to be a potent inhibitor of bacterial ureases  and can also act in the form of hydrofluoric acid as a transmembrane proton conductor to acidify the cytoplasm of intact cells with possible indirect, acid inhibition of urease. our research objectives were to assess the inhibitory potencies of fluoride for three urease-positive bacteria commonly found in the mouth and to determine the relative importance of direct and indirect inhibition  of ureases for overall inhibition of intact cells or biofilms. methods: the experimental design involved intact bacteria in suspensions, mono-organism biofilms, cell extracts, and dental plaque. standard enzymatic assays for ammonia production from urea were used. results: we found that ureolysis by cells in suspensions or mono-organism biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus salivarius or actinomyces naeslundii was inhibited by fluoride at plaque levels of 0.1-0.5 mm in a ph-dependent manner. the results of experiments  with the organic weak acids indomethacin and capric acid, which do not directly inhibit urease enzyme, indicated that weak-acid effects leading to cytoplasmic acidification are also involved in fluoride inhibition. however, direct fluoride  inhibition of urease appeared to be the major mechanism for reduction in ureolytic activity in acid environments. results of experiments with freshly harvested supragingival dental plaque indicated responses to fluoride similar to  those of s. salivarius with ph-dependent fluoride inhibition and both direct and  indirect inhibition of urease. conclusion: fluoride can act to diminish alkali production from urea by oral bacteria through direct and indirect mechanisms.

TI  == bacterial populations on silicone hydrogel and hydrogel contact lenses after swimming in a chlorinated pool.
AB  == purpose: a number of reports have indicated an association between swimming with  contact lenses and subsequent eye infection. this study tests whether a hydrophilic contact lens worn while swimming accumulates bacteria present in the  water. it was of interest to determine whether lens type (silicone hydrogel vs. hydrogel) affected the result. methods: fifteen healthy noncontact lens wearers swam for 30 minutes with a silicone hydrogel lens (purevision, bausch & lomb, rochester, ny) on one eye and a hydrogel lens (acuvue 2, vistakon inc., jacksonville, fl) on the other. lenses were removed aseptically and placed in sterile vials 10 minutes after the subjects left the water. microbial growth was  enumerated for total numbers of colonies and categorized by species present. numbers of colonies were compared between the two lens groups and with a water sample taken from the pool at the time of the experiment. eight of the subjects returned on a different day and wore new lenses for 50 minutes in normal room conditions. results: two lenses were lost while swimming. twenty-seven of the remaining 28 lenses worn while swimming showed colonization, principally with staphylococcus epidermidis, which was also by far the most common species identified from the water itself. small numbers of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus salivarius were also present in the water and on the lenses. numbers of colonies varied among subjects (range, 0 to 230), but no differences were observed between the two lens groups. lenses removed after 30 minutes of wear without swimming were mostly sterile, with 3 of 16 lenses showing just two colonies each. conclusion: it appears that wearing a hydrophilic lens while swimming allows accumulation of microbial organisms on or in the lens, regardless of lens material. swimmers should be advised to wear tight-fitting goggles if lenses are worn while swimming, and thorough disinfection of the lenses before overnight wear seems prudent.

TI  == biosurfactant from lactococcus lactis 53 inhibits microbial adhesion on silicone  rubber.
AB  == the ability of biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium lactococcus lactis 53 to inhibit adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements. water contact angles indicated that the silicone-rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (48 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). the results showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates of staphylococcus epidermidis gb 9/6 from 2,100 to 220 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), streptococcus salivarius gb 24/9 from 1560 to 137 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), and staphylococcus aureus gb 2/1 from 1255 to 135 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), allowing for a 90% reduction of the deposition rates. the deposition rates of rothia dentocariosa gbj 52/2b, candida albicans gbj 13/4a, and candida tropicalis gb 9/9 were far less reduced in the presence of the biosurfactant as compared with the other strains. this study constitutes a step ahead in developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of silicone-rubber voice prostheses.

TI  == inhibition of adhesion of yeasts and bacteria by poly(ethylene oxide)-brushes on  glass in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  == poly(ethylene oxide) (peo)-brushes are generally recognized as protein-repellent  surfaces, and although a role in discouraging microbial adhesion has been established for some strains and species, no study exists on the effects of peo-brushes on a large variety of bacterial and yeast strains. in this paper, a peo-brush has been covalently attached to glass and silica by reaction in a polymer melt. subsequently, the presence of a peo-brush was demonstrated using contact angle measurements, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry. for five bacterial (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two yeast strains (candida albicans and candida tropicalis), adhesion to peo-brushes  was compared with adhesion to bare glass in a parallel plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rates of sta. epidermidis, sta. aureus and str. salivarius to  glass were relatively high, between 2400 and 2600 cm(-2) s(-1), while e. coli and p. aeruginosa deposited much more slowly. the initial deposition rates of the yeasts to glass were 144 and 444 cm(-2) s(-1) for c. albicans gb 1/2 and c. tropicalis gb 9/9, respectively. coating of the glass surface with a peo-brush yielded more than 98 % reduction in bacterial adhesion, although for the more hydrophobic p. aeruginosa a smaller reduction was observed. for both yeast species adhesion suppression was less effective than for the bacteria and here too the more hydrophobic c. tropicalis showed less reduction than the more hydrophilic c. albicans. the peo-brush had a thickness of 22 nm in water, as inferred from ellipsometry. assuming that on bare glass the adhered micro-organisms are positioned only a few nanometers away from the surface and that the brush keeps them at a distance of 22 nm, it is calculated that the brush yields a sevenfold attenuation of the lifshitz-van der waals attraction to the surface between the micro-organisms and the surface. decreased lifshitz-van der waals attraction may be responsible for the suppression of the microbial adhesion observed.

AB  == deposition to glass of streptococcus salivarius hb-c12 and staphylococcus epidermidis 3399 in a parallel plate flow chamber has been studied as a function  of ionic strength. electrophoretic mobility measurements revealed that s. epidermidis 3399 possesses a thick ion-penetrable layer, probably associated with its encapsulation, while s. salivarius hb-c12 has an ion-impenetrable surface. streaming potential measurements indicated that also the glass surface was covered with a relatively thin, ion-penetrable layer. theoretical initial deposition rates of both strains to glass were obtained by numerically solving the convective-diffusion equation, while accounting for the ion-penetrability of  the interacting surfaces. experimentally, the initial deposition rate of the ion-penetrable strain s. epidermidis 3399 was found to be higher and less dependent on ionic strength than of the ion-impenetrable s. salivarius hb-c12, in accordance with theoretical expectations. agreement between theoretical and experimental deposition rates could be obtained when glass was considered ion-penetrable when interacting with the ion-penetrable organism s. epidermidis 3399, while glass behaved as an ion-impenetrable surface when interacting with the ion-impenetrable s. salivarius hb-c12. probably, interaction with an ion-impenetrable strain drives the diffuse double layer charges into the limited  volume of the thin ion-penetrable layer on the glass, readily filling it up and making it appear ion-impenetrable. during interaction of glass with another ion-penetrable surface, as of s. epidermidis 3399, diffuse double layer charges move into both ion-penetrable surfaces, resulting in a much lower mobile charge density in the ion-penetrable layer on the glass which consequently continues to  behave as ion-penetrable.

TI  == high sensitivity of mycobacterium species to the bactericidal activity by polylysine.
AB  == bactericidal effects of polylysine on different bacterial species were measured.  marked differences in sensitivity were observed. based on the concentration of polylysine required to reduce cell viability by 50%, mycobacterium smegmatis and  mycobacterium tuberculosis were found to be the most sensitive and escherichia coli the most resistant. in addition, two gram-positive organisms, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius exhibited significant differences in sensitivity which suggests that the relationship between sensitivity towards polylysine and bacterial cell type is not necessarily a function of the overall cell envelope structure. the high sensitivity of mycobacteria suggests the possible use of polylysine, or a conjugate of polylysine and another agent in anti-mycobacterial drug design.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

TI  == low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  == the antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, neisseria  sp., diphtheroid, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans. the saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. the calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). no statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (p > 0.01). however, the low surface tension (46.5 x  10(-3) nm-1) and high ph (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.

TI  == [maternal morbidity after abdominal cesarean section in relation to bacterial amniotic fluid colonization and premature rupture of fetal membranes].
AB  == at the time of caesarean section, amniotic fluid was collected transabdominally from 1025 patients. in 990 patients cultures were performed on the amniotic fluid. the incidence of caesarean section of all patients was 16.1%, the perinatal mortality in all patients 0.61%, in cases of caesarean section 1.93%. the influence of bacterial colonisation in the amniotic cavity was analyzed with  respect to premature ruptured membranes and frequency of vaginal examinations on  the maternal post-operative morbidity (wound-seroma and abscess 2.4%, febrile morbidity 17%, urinary tract infection 19%). bacterial contamination was present  in 33.3% of the amniotic fluid or uterine cavity, after ruptured membranes in 44.3%, without ruptured membranes in 23.35%. there is a significant influence of  the positive cultured amniotic fluid on the wound healing and on the febrile morbidity, while the urinary tract infection has been not influenced. the bacterial contamination of the amniotic fluid is correlated to the frequency of vaginal examination and the presence of ruptured membranes. the following microbiologic isolates were found in the amniotic fluids: staphylococcus epidermidis 36.38%, streptococcus b 12.23%, streptococcus d 10.3%, escherichia coli 8.42%, staphylococcus aureus 7.88%, peptococci 3.26%, streptococcus salivarius 2.99%, bacteroides 2.4%. according to these data, patients with ruptured membranes of an interval of more than 12 hrs and with more than 7 vaginal examinations could be selected for antibiotic prophylaxis to achieve a reduction in febrile morbidity and in wound infection.

TI  == electrophoretic analysis of ureases in streptococcus salivarius and in saliva.
AB  == experimental conditions were established for the extraction, electrophoresis and  detection of urease isoenzymes from streptococcus salivarius. thiol concentrations were critical and ureases from different strains varied in ease of dissociation. a characteristic pattern was obtained for 30 ureolytic s. salivarius strains isolated from; saliva (6), dental plaque (12), artificial dental plaque (6) and non-oral sources (6), and also for a ureolytic streptococcus bovis from artificial plaque. one non-oral s. salivarius strain had ureases with slightly slower mobility. the electrophoretic pattern and mobility of ureases extracted from human mixed salivary bacteria were identical to those from s. salivarius except for an additional set of urease bands from unknown species of bacteria. there were no ureases from saliva matching those from staphylococcus epidermidis--a contributor to ureolysis in artificial plaque. we conclude that there is considerable biochemical homogeneity among s. salivarius ureases and possibly other ureolytic streptococci. in saliva, urea is metabolized mainly by streptococcal ureases.

TI  == clinical laboratory challenges in the recognition of leuconostoc spp.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant streptococcus salivarius-like bacteria were isolated from the blood and gastrostomy tube of a 6-month-old child during vancomycin therapy for staphylococcus epidermidis central venous catheter-associated bacteremia. the isolates produced d-(-)-lactate and ethanol from glucose, hydrolyzed esculin, and produced no ammonia from arginine, thus fulfilling the major criteria as leuconostoc spp. the enzymatic profile of the bacteria suggested that they were not lactobacilli or streptococci. resistance to vancomycin and penicillin tolerance were noted. the formula fed through the gastrostomy tube was suspected  as the vehicle that transmitted the organism to the patient. penicillin and tobramycin therapy was used successfully.

TI  == the bacteria responsible for ureolysis in artificial dental plaque.
AB  == the origin of ureolytic activity in artificial-mouth plaques was established by assessing the contribution to plaque ureolytic activity of the isolated bacteria. to overcome losses of ureolytic activity caused by the unstable presence of urease in oral bacteria, ureolytic bacteria were isolated from an exceptionally active plaque (1 mumol nh3/min per mg protein) in which 63 per cent of the flora  was ureolytic. after their ability to metabolize urea was stabilized, 13 ureolytic bacteria remained: seven strains of streptococcus salivarius, one streptococcus bovis, two staphylococcus epidermidis and three staphylococcus haemolyticus. their urease activity, measured after growth into stationary phase, was reproducible and strain specific with a 20-fold range within each genus. the  mean ureolytic activity of each species, when weighted by its calculated incidence in the original plaque, accounted for 40 per cent of the total plaque ureolytic activity. however, these values for urease levels were only a small fraction of the bacterial ureolytic potential. urease per mg cell protein measured during the growth cycle of a selected strep. salivarius, and staph. epidermidis, varied 10-fold, and reached much higher activities (i.e. 6-8 mumol nh3/min per mg of cell protein) than under the growth conditions that were used to assess the contribution of these species to total plaque ureolysis. thus urea  metabolism in artificial plaque was due mainly to strep. salivarius, with a small contribution from staph. epidermidis. the presence of further unidentified species of ureolytic oral bacteria need not be invoked.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

AB  == bacterial cell walls from str. bovis, str. lactis, str. mutans, str. thermophilus, str. salivarius, and str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. s. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. it was also shown that cell  walls from s. epidermidis, b. megaterium, and m. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. a close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the ppd hypersensitivity. it was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.

AB  == the cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible micrococcus lysodeikticus (nctc 2665) and lysozyme-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of staphylococcus aureus (copenhagen), streptococcus pyogens (group a, type 6; s43/100), streptococcus salivarius (ifo 3350), streptococcus faecalis (ifo 12580), streptococcus mutans (bht), lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), bacillus megaterium (ifo 12068), corynebacterium diphtheriae (park-williams no. 8), mycobacterium smegmatis, and actinomyces viscous (atcc 15987). evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.

TI  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. four of six different strains, including the propagating s. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. all six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. in contrast to sensitive s. aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella montevideo, s. zymogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. among gram-positive bacteria, only d. pneumoniae inhibited s. aureus bacteriostasis. agglutinins of s. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, c-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for s. aureus serum bacteriostasis. after diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins a, g, and m appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. it is suggested that s. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions  with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.
