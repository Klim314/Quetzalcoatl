TI  == mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. ii. microbiological results.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. we performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. materials and methods: an expanded checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in  17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. statistics included non-parametric tests and glm multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. results: at selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: fusobacterium nucleatum sp., staphylococci sp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, helicobacter pylori, and tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, and veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). no such  differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. no microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. conclusions: both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.

TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == anaerobic osteomyelitis in children.
AB  == twenty-six pediatric patients with osteomyelitis caused by anaerobic bacteria are presented. the etiologic factors were chronic mastoiditis (7 patients), decubitus ulcers (5), chronic sinusitis (4), periodontal abscesses (3), bites (3), paronychia (2), trauma (1) and scalp infection after fetal monitoring (1). seventy-four organisms (2.8 isolates/specimen), including 63 anaerobes (2.4/specimen), and 11 facultative and aerobic bacteria (0.4/specimen) were recovered. the predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci (29 isolates), bacteroides sp. (21), fusobacterium sp. (8), streptococcus sp. (5) and clostridium sp. (4). the organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. these included all isolates of the bacteroides fragilis (4) and of staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 bacteroides oralis. the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  == aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients.  anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only  organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. there were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 bacteroides sp. (including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of adenoids in children: a comparison between  patients with chronic adenotonsillitis and adenoid hypertrophy.
AB  == adenoids were obtained from 18 children with chronic adenotonsillitis (group a) and from 12 others with adenoid hypertrophy (group b). patients' ages ranged from 20 months to 15 years (mean 6 years); 18 were males and 12 females. the adenoids  were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface, and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.6 anaerobes and 3.2 aerobes) per specimen. there were 97 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates in both groups were: bacteroides sp. (including b. melaninogenicus and b. oralis), fusobacterium sp., gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and veillonella sp. there were 138 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates in both groups were: alpha and gamma hemolytic streptococci, beta hemolytic streptococci (group a, b, c, and f), s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and hemophilus sp. hemophilus influenzae type b, and s. aureus were more frequently isolated in group a. b. fragilis was only recovered in group a. beta lactamase production was noted in 27 isolates obtained from 18 patients. fifteen of these patients belonged to group a (83% of group a), while 3 were members of group b (25% of group b). these bacteria were all isolates of s. aureus (11) and b. fragilis (2), 8 of 22 b. melaninogenicus group, 4 of 11 b. oralis, and two of 8 h. influenza type b. our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep adenoid flora and demonstrate the presence of many beta lactamase-producing organisms in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.

TI  == the treatment of the carrier state of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci with clindamycin.
AB  == 20 children who were chronic carriers of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs) were treated with oral clindamycin. surface tonsillar cultures were obtained prior to therapy and 2 weeks after termination of therapy. they were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. prior to therapy, the average yield was 9  isolates (5 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.7 isolates (3 aerobes and 2.7 anaerobes). gabhs, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and bacteroides oralis were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy and the number of isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus and fusobacterium sp. was reduced. beta lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 21 isolates recovered from 16 tonsillar surfaces (80%). these included all isolates of s. aureus (8) and b. fragilis (2), 8 of 18 b. melaninogenicus (44%), and 3 of 5 b. oralis (60%). only  one isolate of beta-lactamase-producing strain of b. melaninogenicus was recovered after conclusion of therapy. follow-up of the patients for 18 - 24 months (average 22 months) showed no recurrence of gabhs in 19 of the 20 children.
