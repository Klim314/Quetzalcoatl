TI  == [assessment of susceptibility of strictly anaerobic bacteria originated from different sources to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == introduction: during the past 20 years, several studies at a national level in different countries followed resistance trends for bacteroides sp. and clostridium difficile. this study analysed antimicrobial susceptibility 73 anaerobic bacteria strains of bacteroides fragilis group (bfg) and c. difficile to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs. methods: the strictly anaerobes strains isolated in different hospitals were sent to the department of  medical microbiology, medical uniwersity of warsaw, where species determination was carried out with the api20 ana (biomerieux sa, marcy-l'etoile, france) system. susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined using e-test. results: the rates of high resistance to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin of bfg was respectively 84% and 31% and among of c. difficile strains respectively 92% and 36%). the percentage of bfg strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin were respectively 84% and 46%. the percentage of c. difficile strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin was 52%. reduced level of susceptibility of bfg strains to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (8%) was confirmed. resistance to cefoxitin was 16% of bfg strains. all tested strains as well as bfg and c. difficile were susceptible to metronidazole. was observed reduced leve (eucast) of susceptibility of c. difficile strains to vancomycin (13%). conclusions. increasing resistance to various antimicrobial agents is a significant problem in poland. this demonstrate the need to continue with antibiotic resistance testing  and surveys in anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == clostridia in premature neonates' gut: incidence, antibiotic susceptibility, and  perinatal determinants influencing colonization.
AB  == background: although premature neonates (pn) gut microbiota has been studied, data about gut clostridial colonization in pn are scarce. few studies have reported clostridia colonization in pn whereas bacteroides and bifidobacteria have been seldom isolated. such aberrant gut microbiota has been suggested to be  a risk factor for the development of intestinal infections. besides, pn are often treated by broad spectrum antibiotics, but little is known about how antibiotics  can influence clostridial colonization based on their susceptibility patterns. the aim of this study was to report the distribution of clostridium species isolated in feces from pn and to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. additionally, clostridial colonization perinatal determinants were analyzed. results: of the 76 pn followed until hospital discharge in three french neonatal intensive care units (nicus), 79% were colonized by clostridia. clostridium sp. colonization, with a high diversity of species, increased throughout the hospitalization. antibiotic courses had no effect on the clostridial colonization incidence although strains were found susceptible (except c. difficile) to anti-anaerobe molecules tested. however, levels of colonization were decreased by either antenatal or neonatal (during more than 10  days) antibiotic courses (p = 0.006 and p = 0.001, respectively). besides, incidence of colonization was depending on the nicu (p = 0.048). conclusion: this study shows that clostridia are part of the pn gut microbiota. it provides for the first time information on the status of clostridia antimicrobial susceptibility in pn showing that strains were susceptible to most antibiotic molecules. thus, the high prevalence of this genus is not linked to a high degree of resistance to antimicrobial agents or to the use of antibiotics in nicus. the  main perinatal determinant influencing pn clostridia colonization appears to be the nicu environment.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == bacteriophage treatment significantly reduces viable clostridium difficile and prevents toxin production in an in vitro model system.
AB  == clostridium difficile is primarily a nosocomial pathogen, causing thousands of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in the uk each year. in this study, we used a batch fermentation model of a c. difficile colonised system to evaluate the potential of a prophylactic and a remedial bacteriophage treatment regime to  control the pathogen. it is shown that the prophylaxis regime was effective at preventing the growth of c. difficile (p = <0.001) and precluded the production of detectable levels of toxins a and b. the remedial treatment regime caused a less profound and somewhat transient decrease in the number of viable c. difficile cells (p = <0.0001), but still resulted in a lower level of toxin production relative to the control. the numbers of commensal bacteria including total aerobes and anaerobes, bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp., lactobacillus  sp., total clostridium sp., and enterobacteriaceae were not significantly decreased by this therapy, whereas significant detrimental effects were observed  with metronidazole treatment. our study indicates that phage therapy has potential to be used for the control of c. difficile; it highlights the main benefits of this approach, and some future challenges.

TI  == effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. however, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. in this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-o-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like clostridium spp., bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. this indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. the bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of t-3811me, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activities of t-3811me, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. t-3811, a free base of t-3811me, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. in particular, t-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. t-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp). t-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with gyra and parc (grla) mutations. the  activity of t-3811 against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. in common with other fluoroquinolones, t-3811 was highly active against haemophilus  influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and legionella sp., with mic90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. t-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. t-3811 was the most active agent against c. trachomatis (mic, 0.008 microgram/ml) and m. pneumoniae (mic90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). the activity of t-3811 against m. tuberculosis (mic90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. in experimental systemic infection with a grla mutant of s. aureus and experimental  pneumonia with prsp in mice, t-3811me showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.

TI  == the intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  == bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. in infants delivered by caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. the first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which  remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. among them, staphylococcus,  enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from  the newborn faecal flora at birth. facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by bifidobacterium sp. clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a caesarean section. clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as bacteroides and other clostridium sp. the impact of caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. in humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. formula feeding seems  to promote implantation and persistence of clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of c. difficile in newborns.

TI  == new selective medium for isolating clostridium difficile from faeces.
AB  == aims: to compare ccfa (cycloserine, cefoxitin fructose agar) with a new selective medium cdmn (containing cysteine hydrochloride, norfloxacin, and moxalactam) for  the isolation of clostridium difficile after direct faecal culture. methods: the  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of norfloxacin was determined for 64 strains of c difficile, 17 strains of other clostridium sp, and 66 various isolates of faecal origin, together with mic determinations of moxalactam against the 81 strains of clostridium sp and 15 isolates of bacteroides sp. using c difficile agar base with 0.5 g/l of cysteine hydrochloride, norfloxacin and moxalactam were incorporated into the medium and compared with ccfa for the isolation of c difficile after direct faecal culture. results: norfloxacin (12 mg/l) inhibited the growth of enterobacteriaceae and faecal streptococci; moxalactam (32 mg/l) inhibited the growth of most strains of bacteroides sp tested, together with clostridium sp other than c difficile. using the antibiotics in combination (cdmn), the growth and colonial morphology of 64 strains of c difficile were unaffected. when cdmn medium was compared with ccfa for the isolation of c difficile from 832 faeces from inpatients with diarrhoea,  the cdmn agar isolated 20% more strains and reduced the number of contaminating colonies by 30%. conclusions: cdmn both improves the isolation rate of c difficile from faecal specimens and reduces the growth of other organisms compared with ccfa.

TI  == [influence of cefodizime via intravenous bolus injection on human fecal flora].
AB  == cefodizime (cdzm), a newly developed injectable cephem antibiotic, was given to 8 healthy male volunteers with ages 23-28 years (mean: 24 years) and body weights 54-73 kg (mean: 64 kg). 4 volunteers received 2 g b.i.d., intravenous infusion for 5 days, and 4 volunteers had 4 g b.i.d. for the same duration. we studied changes in bacterial flora and drug levels in feces, as well as changes in susceptibility of isolated microbes to cdzm, cefmetazole, cefotaxime (ctx) and cefoperazone. adverse drug reactions and changes in laboratory findings were also investigated. the following results were obtained. 1. in fecal flora for the 2 g  b.i.d. group, on day 3 of treatment enterobacteriaceae were identified in only 2  of the 4 cases. individual microbe counts decreased or fell below detection limit (10(2) cells/g) on day 3 of treatment. colony forming units (cfus) of enterobacteriaceae on day 5 of treatment were similar to those on day 3. after the end of treatment, its cfus increased. the mean cfu of enterobacteriaceae on day 10 after the end of treatment increased to about the same level as before dosing. however, some microbes did not revert to pretreatment levels. of other gram-negative bacilli, pseudomonas sp. increased in one case transiently on day 3 of treatment. after day 3 of treatment, its cfu decreased. gram-positive microbes showed various changes. mean cfu of yeast like organism (ylo) increased between day 3 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment and its mean cfu decreased on day 10 after the treatment. as for anaerobes, cfus of bacteroides fragilis group organisms and overall anaerobes showed no distinctive changes. clostridium difficile were detected in two cases. in one case, c. difficile was noted at levels between 1.1 x 10(3) cells/g and 2.0 x 10(6) cells/g at the following sampling times: days 1 and 3 of treatment and days 3, 5, 10 and 20 after the end of treatment. in other case, it was noted at levels of 1.8 x 10(5)  cells/g on day 20 after the end of treatment. d-1 toxin was detected in one case  before dosing, and in three cases (the concentration of d-1 toxin was 250 ng/g or 500 ng/g) on day after treatment. enterobacteriaceae in fecal flora of 4 cases given 4 g b.i.d. frequently decreased or fell below detection limit on days 3 and 5 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  == the antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas maltophilia, serratia marcescens, enterococcus sp, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides bivius, and clostridium difficile obtained  from laboratories at hospitals in st. louis, in memphis, and in newark, new jersey. of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime,  81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam,  and 51% to cefoxitin.

TI  == bacteriotherapy for chronic relapsing clostridium difficile diarrhoea in six patients.
AB  == six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in  sterile saline (five patients). the mixture led to a prompt loss of cl difficile  and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by bacteroides sp, which  had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. strains of escherichia coli, cl bifermentans, and peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides vulgatus, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. the finding that bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was  present after recovery suggests that the absence of bacteroides sp may result in  chronic relapsing cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by cl difficile.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefotaxime against clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == the present in vitro antibacterial activities of cefotaxime and 8 other cephalosporins (cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefpiramide, latamoxef, cefamandole, cefmetazole, cefotiam and cephazolin) were evaluated simultaneously in 384 strains of gram-positive cocci, 595 strains of enterobacteriaceae, 240 strains of non-fermenters and 143 strains of anaerobes and miscellaneous organisms. the results were expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range, mic50 and mic90. of the beta-lactams, cefotaxime and latamoxef exhibited the highest activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. mic90 of cefotaxime, however, for species of pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas  maltophilia, enterococci, bacteroides sp. and clostridium difficile were more than 100 mg/l. cefpiramide and cefoperazone were generally less active than these 2 agents. all strains were tested for beta-lactamase production by the cefinase disc method and the relationship of susceptibility to beta-lactams was evaluated  in each species. the need was demonstrated for periodic susceptibility testing to be performed to better guide empirical antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == in vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of sulphasalazine (sasp), azodisal sodium (ads), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. sulphapyridine (sp) had a mild to moderate effect on escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. sasp also had a growth-inhibitory effect on strep. faecalis. the other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. sasp, sp, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, n-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. of special interest  was the inhibitory effect on clostridium difficile strains. in recent years the possibility that overgrowth of cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. some studies suggested that sasp treatment could predispose to cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found  sasp more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. our findings support the theory that sasp treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of cl. difficile superinfection.

TI  == piperacillin sodium: antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions.
AB  == piperacillin sodium is a beta lactam antibiotic with a broad range of antibacterial activity that includes gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci (except penicillinase-producing s. aureus) and anaerobic pathogens such as clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis. piperacillin inhibits many of the members of the enterobacteriaceae, including klebsiella sp and pseudomonas, at lower concentrations than required for carbenicillin and ticarcillin. piperacillin sodium is administered by intramuscular and intravenous injection and is widely distributed throughout body fluids and tissues. like other newer penicillins, piperacillin is excreted by both renal and biliary mechanisms. the primary route of elimination is by glomerular filtration, which results in high urinary concentrations of the unchanged compound. piperacillin has been approved  for patients with serious infection caused by susceptible strains of specific organisms in intra-abdominal, urinary tract, gynecologic, lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, bone and joint, and gonococcal infections and septicemia. as with other penicillins, piperacillin has a low frequency of toxicity. the usual dose of piperacillin in adults with serious infections with normal renal function is 3-4 g every 4-6 hr as a 20-30 min infusion, with a maximum dose of 24 g per day. it is stable in most large volume parenteral solutions. less serious infectins (requiring smaller dosages) may be treated by intramuscular injection; however, no more than 2 g should be given at any one injection site. overall, piperacillin has a greater degree of activity than other penicillins. evidence from prospective studies indicates that piperacillin is a highly effective agent for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  == susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria to n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) and  to other antibiotics.
AB  == the susceptibilities of 462 clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates to n-formimidoyl thienamycin and 16 other currently available and investigational antibiotics were determined by the agar dilution technique. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was significantly more active than the reference antibiotics against  most organisms tested, especially bacteroides sp., including clindamycin-resistant strains. all 462 isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and no resistant strains were found in the species tested. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was less active (i.e., had a higher 50% minimal inhibitory concentration) against fusobacterium sp. than clindamycin, sm-1652, and piperacillin, and less active against clostridium difficile than metronidazole, but was equally active or more active than the other reference antibiotics tested.
