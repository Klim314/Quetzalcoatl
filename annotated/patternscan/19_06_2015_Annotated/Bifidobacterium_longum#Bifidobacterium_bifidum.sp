TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and bifidobacterium longum mm-2 ingestion induces a less inflammatory cytokine profile and a potentially beneficial shift in gut microbiota in older adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.
AB  == objective: this study determined whether older adults who consumed a probiotic mixture would have a greater proportion of circulating cd4+ lymphocytes, altered  cytokine production, and a shift in intestinal microbiota toward a healthier microbial community. methods: participants (70 +/- 1 years [mean +/- sem]; n = 32) consumed a probiotic (lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and bifidobacterium longum mm2) or a placebo twice daily for 3 weeks with a 5-week washout period between intervention periods. blood and stools were collected before and after each intervention. the percentage of circulating cd4+  lymphocytes and ex vivo mitogen-stimulated cell cytokine production were measured. in stools, specific bacterial targets were quantified via quantitative  polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and community composition was determined via pyrosequencing. results: during the first period of the crossover the percentage  of cd4+ cells decreased with the placebo (48% +/- 3% to 31% +/- 3%, p < 0.01) but did not change with the probiotic (44% +/- 3% to 42% +/- 3%) and log-transformed  concentrations of interleukin-10 increased with the probiotic (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.4 +/- 0.2, p < 0.0001) but not the placebo (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.2). with the probiotic versus the placebo a higher percentage of participants had an increase  in fecal bifidobacteria (48% versus 30%, p < 0.05) and lactic acid bacteria (55%  versus 43%, p < 0.05) and a decrease in escherichia coli (52% versus 27%, p < 0.05). several bacterial groups matching faeacalibactierium prausnitzii were more prevalent in stool samples with the probiotic versus placebo. conclusions: the probiotic maintained cd4+ lymphocytes and produced a less inflammatory cytokine profile possibly due to the changes in the microbial communities, which more closely resembled those reported in healthy younger populations.

TI  == the neonatal gut harbours distinct bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == background: recent studies have described the bifidobacterial composition of neonates at a species level; however, with advancing technologies we can gain insight into the diversity of the bifidobacterial microbiota residing within the  infant gut. objective: to compare species and strain diversity of culturable bifidobacterial populations in faecal samples obtained from healthy term infants  on three different feeding regimes. study design: in total, 51 healthy term infants were recruited for this study and divided equally into three different groups (n=17) based on their feeding regime during the first 4 weeks of life. culturable bifidobacterial populations were analysed at week 1, week 4 and 6 months of age. isolates were characterised to species level by 16s rrna-internally transcribed spacer (its) gene sequence analysis and to strain level by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: in total,173 bifidobacterial strains were detected across all three groups from 2295 isolates, 42% (72 of 173) of which were detected in the prebiotic-fed group, followed by 30% (52 of 173) and 28% (49 of 173) in the breastfed and non-prebiotic-fed groups, respectively. surprisingly, only two of the 51 infants harboured an identical bifidobacterial strain which was not present in the other 49 infants. prebiotic supplementation in the early neonatal period increased the prevalence of bifidobacterium longum in infants, in addition to promoting strain diversity.  b. longum was the dominant species recovered from all three groups during the first 6 months of life, followed by bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium bifidum. conclusions: this study reveals a hitherto unknown level of diversity at the strain level among bifidobacteria isolated from different infants and the influence prebiotic formula feeding has on the bifidobacterial population.

TI  == a novel lactobacillus casei lp1 producing 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, a bifidogenic growth stimulator.
AB  == 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (dhna) is a bifidogenic growth stimulator (bgs) and could be a functional food ingredient since bifidobacteria are beneficial for human health. for that reason, lactic acid bacteria producing dhna have been screened. a lactic acid bacterium lp1 strain isolated from a natural cheese was confirmed to produce dhna, analyzed by a hplc method. the strain was identified as lactobacillus casei by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the cell-free supernatant of fermented whey produced by l. casei lp1 presented the bgs activity for three bifidobacterial strains such as bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis  kctc 3127, bifidobacterium bifidum kctc 3202, and bifidobacterium breve kctc 3220 which were human-originated. to the best of our knowledge, a l. casei strain which can produce dhna was firstly identified in this study.

TI  == novel substrate specificities of two lacto-n-biosidases towards beta-linked galacto-n-biose-containing oligosaccharides of globo h, gb5, and ga1.
AB  == we describe the novel substrate specificities of two independently evolved lacto-n-biosidases (lnbx and lnbb) towards the sugar chains of globo- and ganglio-series glycosphingolipids. lnbx, a non-classified member of the glycoside hydrolase family, isolated from bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, was shown to liberate galacto-n-biose (gnb: galbeta1-3galnac) and 2'-fucosyl gnb (a type-4  trisaccharide) from gb5 pentasaccharide and globo h hexasaccharide, respectively. lnbb, a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 20 isolated from bifidobacterium bifidum, was shown to release gnb from gb5 and ga1 oligosaccharides. this is the  first report describing enzymatic release of beta-linked gnb from natural substrates. these unique activities may play a role in modulating the microbial composition in the gut ecosystem, and may serve as new tools for elucidating the  functions of sugar chains of glycosphingolipids.

TI  == cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and  exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions;  hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use  of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on  their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected  enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46  and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum  + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures  was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal  conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.

TI  == multilocus sequence typing of bifidobacterial strains from infant's faeces and human milk: are bifidobacteria being sustainably shared during breastfeeding?
AB  == bifidobacteria are considered to be one of the most important beneficial intestinal bacteria for infants, contributing to the priming of the mucosal immune system. these microbes can also be detected in mother's milk, suggesting a potential role of human milk in the colonisation of infant's gut. however, little is known about the timing of bacteria appearance in human milk, and whether human milk is the first source of inoculation. here, we investigated whether specific strains are shared sustainably between maternal milk and infant's gut. faecal samples and human milk were collected from 102 healthy mother-infant pairs (infant's faeces: meconium, 7, 30 days of age; mother's milk: once before delivery, colostrum, 7, 30 days after delivery). bifidobacterial strains were isolated from these samples, and were discriminated by means of multilocus sequencing typing. no bifidobacteria were detected from human milk collected before delivery, or colostrum. strains were isolated only from human milk samples obtained 7 days after birth or later. on the other hand, bifidobacterial strains  were obtained from infant's faeces throughout the study period, sometimes as early as the first day of life (meconium). we have found that bifidobacterial species belonging to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum could be identified as monophyletic between  infant's faeces and their mother's milk. these strains were confirmed to be sustainably shared between maternal milk and infant's gut. moreover, monophyletic strains were isolated at the same time point or earlier from infant's faeces than from human milk, and none were isolated earlier from human milk than from infant's faeces. although it remains unclear whether human milk is the first source of microbes for infants, our results confirm that human milk is a reservoir of bifidobacteria, and specific strains are shared between infant's intestine and human milk during breastfeeding.

TI  == the effect of probiotics on serum levels of cytokine and endotoxin in peritoneal  dialysis patients: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == inflammatory markers such as interleukin (il)-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha  (tnf-alpha) are elevated in dialysis patients and can predict cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. endotoxin is an important source and also another marker of inflammation in patients with chronic kidney disease. the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of oral probiotics on serum levels of endotoxemia and cytokines in peritoneal dialysis (pd) patients. the decline of residual renal function, peritonitis episodes, and cardiovascular events were also recorded. from july 2011 to june 2012, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in pd patients. the intervention group received one capsule of probiotics containing 10(9) cfu bifobacterium bifidum a218, 10(9) cfu bifidobacterium catenulatum a302, 10(9) cfu bifidobacterium longum a101, and 10(9) cfu lactobacillus plantarum a87 daily for six months, while the placebo group received similar capsules containing maltodextrin for the same duration. levels of serum tnf-alpha, interferon gamma, il-5, il-6, il-10, il-17, and endotoxin were measured before and six months after intervention. 39 patients completed the study (21 in the probiotics group and 18 in the placebo group). in patients receiving probiotics, levels of serum tnf-alpha, il-5, il-6,  and endotoxin significantly decreased after six months of treatment, while levels of serum il-10 significantly increased. in contrast, there were no significant changes in levels of serum cytokines and endotoxin in the placebo group after six months. in addition, the residual renal function was preserved in patients receiving probiotics. in conclusion, probiotics could significantly reduce the serum levels of endotoxin, pro-inflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha and il-6), il-5, increase the serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine (il-10), and preserve residual renal function in pd patients.

TI  == bifidobacterium bifidum r0071 results in a greater proportion of healthy days and a lower percentage of academically stressed students reporting a day of cold/flu: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == acute psychological stress is positively associated with a cold/flu. the present  randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined the effect of three potentially probiotic bacteria on the proportion of healthy days over a 6-week period in academically stressed undergraduate students (n 581) who received lactobacillus helveticus r0052, bifidobacterium longum ssp. infantis r0033, bifidobacterium bifidum r0071 or placebo. on each day, participants recorded the  intensity (scale: 0 = not experiencing to 3 = very intense) for nine cold/flu symptoms, and a sum of symptom intensity >6 was designated as a day of cold/flu.  b. bifidum resulted in a greater proportion of healthy days than placebo (p</= 0.05). the percentage of participants reporting >/= 1 d of cold/flu during the 6-week intervention period was significantly lower with b. bifidum than with placebo (p< 0.05). there were no effects of b. infantis or l. helveticus compared with placebo on either outcome. a predictive model accounted for influential characteristics and their interactions on daily reporting of cold/flu episodes. the proportion of participants reporting a cold on any given day was lower at weeks 2 and 3 with b. bifidum and b. infantis than with placebo for the average level of stress and the most commonly reported number of hours of sleep. daily intake of bifidobacteria provides benefit related to cold/flu outcomes during acute stress.

TI  == oral administration of bifidobacterium spp. improves insulin resistance, induces  adiponectin, and prevents inflammatory adipokine expressions.
AB  == the intestinal microbiome might be an important contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes. this study was designed to test the hypothesis that oral administration of bifidobacterium species (spp.) (including b. longum, b. bifidum, b. infantis, and b. animalis) may both ameliorate insulin resistance and reduce the expressions of inflammatory adipocytokines. male swiss-webster mice fed a high-fat diet with or without oral administration of bifidobacterium spp. for 5 weeks were subjected to an insulin tolerance test and an oral glucose tolerance test. plasma levels of glucose at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after insulin  injection or glucose administration were significantly lower in the bifidobacterium spp. than in the control group (p < 0.05), showing the beneficial effect of oral administration on insulin resistance in obese swiss mice. in addition, bifidobacterium spp. increased the adiponectin mrna level and decreased those of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 6 in non-diabetic c57bl/6j mice fed a normal diet, indicating a molecular mechanism which may ameliorate the inflammatory state, thereby reducing insulin resistance. in conclusion, oral administration of bifidobacterium spp. improves insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in obese mice by reducing inflammation, as it does in the lean state.

TI  == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the  feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms,  but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

TI  == mupirocin-mucin agar for selective enumeration of bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum is a bacterial species exclusively found in the human intestinal tract. this species is becoming increasingly popular as a probiotic organism added to lyophilized products. in this study, porcine mucin was used as  the sole carbon source for the selective enumeration of b. bifidum in probiotic food additives. thirty-six bifidobacterial strains were cultivated in broth with  mucin. only 13 strains of b. bifidum utilized the mucin to produce acids. b. bifidum was selectively enumerated in eight probiotic food supplements using agar (mm agar) containing mupirocin (100 mg/l) and mucin (20 g/l) as the sole carbon source. mm agar was fully selective if the b. bifidum species was presented together with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, bifidobacterium breve, and  bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum species and with lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli, streptococci). isolated strains of b. bifidum were identified using biochemical, pcr, maldi-tof procedures and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the novel selective medium was also suitable for the isolation of b. bifidum strains  from human fecal samples.

TI  == fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and flow cytometric assessment of the antibacterial mechanism of action of aqueous extract of garlic (allium sativum) against selected probiotic bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == background: it is generally reported that garlic (allium sativum) harms pathogenic but not beneficial bacteria. although numerous studies supporting the  alleged garlic effects on pathogens are available, there are limited studies to prove this claim for beneficial bacteria. we have recently shown that garlic exhibits antibacterial activity against probiotic bifidobacteria. the aim of the  current study was to elucidate the mechanism of action of garlic clove extract (gce) on bifidobacterium bifidum lmg 11041, b. longum lmg 13197 and b. lactis bb12 using fourier transform infrared (ft-ir) spectroscopy and flow cytometry. methods: cultures (1 x 108 cfu ml-1) were individually incubated for 6 h at 37 degrees c in garlic clove extract containing allicin at a corresponding predetermined minimum bactericidal concentration for each strain. for ftir, an aliquot of each culture was deposited on caf2 slide and vacuum dried. the slides  were immediately viewed using a bruker vertex 70 v ft-ir spectrometer equipped with a hyperion microscope and data analyzed using opus software (version 6, bruker). spectra were smoothed with a savitsky-goly function algorithim, base-line corrected and normalized. samples for flow cytometry were stained using the live/dead baclight bacterial viability kit l7012. data compensation and analysis was performed using a bd facsaria and flowjo (version 7.6.1). results: fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed changes in spectral features of lipids and fatty acids in cell membranes, proteins, polysaccharides and nucleic acids. spectral data as per principle component analysis (pca) revealed segregation of control and gce-treated cells for all the tested bifidobacteria. flow cytometry not only showed increase in numbers of membrane damaged and possibly lysed cells after gce treatment, but also displayed diffuse light scatter patterns for gce treated cells, which is evidence for changes to the size, granularity and molecular content of the cells. conclusion: garlic has multiple target sites in bifidobacteria, penetrating the cell membrane and entering the cytoplasm, where it causes changes to carbohydrates, fatty acids, proteins and nucleic acids. these changes, for example, modification of membrane  properties, may prevent exposed bifidobacteria from colonizing the intestinal mucosa. loss of colonization potential would render them less efficient as probiotics.

TI  == bifidobacteria supplementation: effects on plasma lipid profiles in dyslipidemic  children.
AB  == objective: preclinical investigations support the use of probiotics in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, but clinical evidence is often contrasting. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic formulation containing three bifidobacterium strains on lipid profiles in children affected by primary dyslipidemia. methods: thirty-eight children with dyslipidemia, ages 10.8 +/- 2.1 y, were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. after a 4-wk diet run-in period, the children received probiotics (b. animalis subspecies lactis mb 2409, b. bifidum mb 109b, and b. longum subspecies longum bl04) or placebo for 3 mo. after 1 mo, wash-out treatments were switched. a strict dietary evaluation concerning satured fatty acids and cholesterol content, step i diet accordingly, was performed by a dietitian who examined the weekly dietary diary at each visit. results: baseline  lipid profile was (mean +/- sd): total cholesterol (tc) 222.8 +/- 23.2 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) 55.8 +/- 12.2 mg/dl, triglycerides (tg) 99.0 +/- 61.7 mg/dl, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) 147.2 +/- 21.9 mg/dl. after 3 mo of probiotic treatment, the lipid profile was: tc 211.9 +/- 27.3 mg/dl, hdl-c 60.7 +/- 14.2 mg/dl, tg 79.5 +/- 34.5 mg/dl, and ldl-c 135.3 +/- 24.2 mg/dl. compared with placebo, probiotics reduced tc by 3.4%  (p = 0.02) and ldl-c by 3.8% (p = 0.001). no significant dietary change occurred  through the study and no relevant adverse effects were observed. conclusions: treatment with a bifidobacterium probiotic formulation was well tolerated and useful in combination with to diet therapy. children with dyslipidemia benefited  from this approach, although the results need to be confirmed by larger controlled studies.

TI  == influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == murein lytic enzyme tgaa of bifidobacterium bifidum mimbb75 modulates dendritic cell maturation through its cysteine- and histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (chap) amidase domain.
AB  == bifidobacteria are gram-positive inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract  that have evolved close interaction with their host and especially with the host's immune system. the molecular mechanisms underlying such interactions, however, are largely unidentified. in this study, we investigated the immunomodulatory potential of bifidobacterium bifidum mimbb75, a bacterium of human intestinal origin commercially used as a probiotic. particularly, we focused our attention on tgaa, a protein expressed on the outer surface of mimbb75's cells and homologous to other known bacterial immunoactive proteins. tgaa is a peptidoglycan lytic enzyme containing two active domains: lytic murein  transglycosylase (lt) and cysteine- and histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (chap). we ran immunological experiments stimulating dendritic cells (dcs) with the b. bifidum mimbb75 and tgaa, with the result that  both the bacterium and the protein activated dcs and triggered interleukin-2 (il-2) production. in addition, we observed that the heterologous expression of tgaa in bifidobacterium longum transferred to the bacterium the ability to induce il-2. subsequently, immunological experiments performed using two purified recombinant proteins corresponding to the single domains lt and chap demonstrated that the chap domain is the immune-reactive region of tgaa. finally, we also showed that tgaa-dependent activation of dcs requires the protein cd14, marginally involves trif, and is independent of toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) and myd88. in conclusion, our study suggests that the bacterial chap domain is a novel microbe-associated molecular pattern actively participating in the cross talk mechanisms between bifidobacteria and the host's immune system.

TI  == hydrolysis of milk gangliosides by infant-gut associated bifidobacteria determined by microfluidic chips and high-resolution mass spectrometry.
AB  == gangliosides are receiving considerable attention because they participate in diverse biological processes. milk gangliosides appear to block pathogen adhesion and modify the intestinal ecology of newborns. however, the interaction of milk gangliosides with gut bifidobacteria has been little investigated. the digestion  products of a mixture of gangliosides isolated from milk following incubation with six strains of bifidobacteria were studied using nanohplc chip q-tof ms. to  understand ganglioside catabolism in vitro, the two major milk gangliosides--gm3  and gd3--remaining in the media after incubation with bifidobacteria were quantified. individual gangliosides were identified through postprocessing precursor ion scans, and quantitated with the "find by molecular feature" algorithm of masshunter qualitative analysis software. bifidobacterium infantis and b. bifidum substantially degraded the gm3 and gd3, whereas b. longum subsp. longum and b. animalis subsp. lactis only showed moderate degradation. maldi fticr ms analysis enabled a deeper investigation of the degradation and identified ganglioside degradation specifically at the outer portions of the glycan molecules. these results indicate that certain infant gut-associated bifidobacteria have the ability to degrade milk gangliosides releasing sialic acid, and that these glycolipids could play a prebiotic role in the infant gut.

TI  == cohort study of probiotics in a north american neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine whether routine probiotic administration to very preterm  infants would reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) without adverse consequences. study design: since the end of july 2011, we have administered a probiotic mixture to all admitted infants of <32 weeks' gestation. we give 0.5 g of a mixture of 4 bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium breve, bifidum, infantis, and longum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus ha-111 [corrected] (2 x 10(9) colony-forming units) per day, starting with the first feed, until the infant reaches 34 weeks. we compared complications among infants admitted during the first 17 months of routine use with those admitted during the previous 17 months. results: two hundred ninety-four infants received probiotics, and 317 infants formed the comparison group. introduction of probiotics was associated with a reduction in nec (from 9.8% to 5.4%, p < .02), a nonsignificant decrease in death (9.8% to 6.8%), and a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or nec (from 17% to 10.5%, p < .05). after adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, and sex, the improvements remained significant (or for nec, 0.51; 95% ci, 0.26-0.98; or for death or nec, 0.56; 95% ci, 0.33-0.93). there was no effect of probiotics on health care-associated infection. discussion: a product that is readily available in north america, that has excellent quality control, and that contains strains similar to those that have been shown effective in randomized controlled trials substantially reduced the frequency of nec in our neonatal intensive care unit.

TI  == multistrain probiotic modulation of intestinal epithelial cells' immune response  to a double-stranded rna ligand, poly(i.c).
AB  == a commercially available product containing three probiotic bacterial strains (lactobacillus helveticus r0052, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis r0033, and bifidobacterium bifidum r0071) was previously shown in animal trials to modulate both th1 and th2 immune responses. clinical studies on this combination  of bacteria have also shown positive health effects against seasonal winter diseases and rotavirus infection. the goal of this study was to use a well-established in vitro intestinal epithelial (ht-29) cell model that has been  shown to constitutively express double-stranded rna (dsrna) sensors (toll-like receptor 3 [tlr3], retinoic acid-inducible gene i, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, and dsrna-activated protein kinase). by using  the ht-29 cell model, we wanted to evaluate whether or not this combination of three bacteria had the capacity to immune modulate the host cell response to a dsrna ligand, poly(i.c). using a custom-designed, two-color expression microarray targeting genes of the human immune system, we investigated the response of ht-29 cells challenged with poly(i.c) both in the presence and in the absence of the three probiotic bacteria. we observed that the combination of the three bacteria  had a major impact on attenuating the expression of genes connected to proinflammatory th1 and antiviral innate immune responses compared to that obtained by the poly(i.c)-only challenge. major pathways through which the multistrain combination may be eliciting its immune-modulatory effect include the tlr3 domain-containing adapter-inducing beta interferon (trif), mitogen-activated protein kinase, and nf-kappab signaling pathways. such a model may be useful for  selecting potential biomarkers for the design of future clinical trials.

TI  == mother-to-infant transmission of intestinal bifidobacterial strains has an impact on the early development of vaginally delivered infant's microbiota.
AB  == objectives: bifidobacterium species are one of the major components of the infant's intestine microbiota. colonization with bifidobacteria in early infancy  is suggested to be important for health in later life. however, information remains limited regarding the source of these microbes. here, we investigated whether specific strains of bifidobacteria in the maternal intestinal flora are transmitted to their infant's intestine. materials and methods: fecal samples were collected from healthy 17 mother and infant pairs (vaginal delivery: 12; cesarean section delivery: 5). mother's feces were collected twice before delivery. infant's feces were collected at 0 (meconium), 3, 7, 30, 90 days after  birth. bifidobacteria isolated from feces were genotyped by multilocus sequencing typing, and the transitions of bifidobacteria counts in infant's feces were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr. results: stains belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, were identified to be monophyletic between mother's and infant's intestine. eleven out of 12 vaginal delivered infants carried at least one monophyletic strain. the bifidobacterial counts of the species to which the monophyletic strains belong, increased predominantly in the infant's intestine within 3 days after birth. among infants delivered by c-section, monophyletic strains were not observed. moreover, the bifidobacterial counts were significantly lower than the vaginal delivered infants until 7 days of age. conclusions: among infants born vaginally, several bifidobacterium strains transmit from the mother and colonize the infant's intestine shortly after birth. our data suggest that the mother's intestine is an important source for the vaginal delivered infant's intestinal microbiota.

TI  == unraveling the leloir pathway of bifidobacterium bifidum: significance of the uridylyltransferases.
AB  == the gnb/lnb (galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose) pathway plays a crucial role in bifidobacteria during growth on human milk or mucin from epithelial cells. it is  thought to be the major route for galactose utilization in bifidobacterium longum as it is an energy-saving variant of the leloir pathway. both pathways are present in b. bifidum, and galactose 1-phosphate (gal1p) is considered to play a  key role. due to its toxic nature, gal1p is further converted into its activated  udp-sugar through the action of poorly characterized uridylyltransferases. in this study, three uridylyltransferases (galt1, galt2, and ugpa) from bifidobacterium bifidum were cloned in an escherichia coli mutant and screened for activity on the key intermediate gal1p. galt1 and galt2 showed udp-glucose-hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase activity (ec 2.7.7.12), whereas ugpa showed promiscuous utp-hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase activity (ec 2.7.7.10). the activity of ugpa toward glucose 1-phosphate was about 33-fold higher than that toward gal1p. galt1, as part of the bifidobacterial leloir pathway, was about 357-fold more active than galt2, the functional analog  in the gnb/lnb pathway. these results suggest that galt1 plays a more significant role than previously thought and predominates when b. bifidum grows on lactose and human milk oligosaccharides. galt2 activity is required only during growth on substrates with a gnb core such as mucin glycans.

TI  == variation in consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by infant gut-associated  strains of bifidobacterium breve.
AB  == human milk contains a high concentration of complex oligosaccharides that influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota in breast-fed infants. previous studies have indicated that select species such as bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis and bifidobacterium bifidum can utilize human milk oligosaccharides (hmo) in vitro as the sole carbon source, while the relatively few b. longum subsp. longum and bifidobacterium breve isolates tested appear less adapted to these substrates. considering the high frequency at which b. breve is  isolated from breast-fed infant feces, we postulated that some b. breve strains can more vigorously consume hmo and thus are enriched in the breast-fed infant gastrointestinal tract. to examine this, a number of b. breve isolates from breast-fed infant feces were characterized for the presence of different glycosyl hydrolases that participate in hmo utilization, as well as by their ability to grow on hmo or specific hmo species such as lacto-n-tetraose (lnt) and fucosyllactose. all b. breve strains showed high levels of growth on lnt and lacto-n-neotetraose (lnnt), and, in general, growth on total hmo was moderate for most of the strains, with several strain differences. growth and consumption of fucosylated hmo were strain dependent, mostly in isolates possessing a glycosyl hydrolase family 29 alpha-fucosidase. glycoprofiling of the spent supernatant after hmo fermentation by select strains revealed that all b. breve strains can utilize sialylated hmo to a certain extent, especially sialyl-lacto-n-tetraose. interestingly, this specific oligosaccharide was depleted before neutral lnt by strain sc95. in aggregate, this work indicates that the hmo consumption phenotype in b. breve is variable; however, some strains display specific adaptations to these substrates, enabling more vigorous consumption of fucosylated and sialylated hmo. these results provide a rationale for the predominance of this species in breast-fed infant feces and contribute to a more accurate picture of the ecology of the developing infant intestinal microbiota.

TI  == differential modulation of human intestinal bifidobacterium populations after consumption of a wild blueberry (vaccinium angustifolium) drink.
AB  == bifidobacteria are gaining increasing interest as health-promoting bacteria. nonetheless, the genus comprises several species, which can exert different effects on human host. previous studies showed that wild blueberry drink consumption could selectively increase intestinal bifidobacteria, suggesting an important role for the polyphenols and fiber present in wild blueberries. this study evaluated the modulation of the most common and abundant bifidobacterial taxonomic groups inhabiting the human gut in the same fecal samples. the analyses carried out showed that b. adolescentis, b. breve, b. catenulatum/pseudocatelulatum, and b. longum subsp. longum were always present in the group of subjects enrolled, whereas b. bifidum and b. longum subsp. infantis  were not. furthermore, it was found that the most predominant bifidobacterial species were b. longum subsp. longum and b. adolescentis. the results obtained revealed a high interindividual variability; however, a significant increase of b. longum subsp. infantis cell concentration was observed in the feces of volunteers after the wild blueberry drink treatment. this bifidobacterial group was shown to possess immunomodulatory abilities and to relieve symptoms and promote the regression of several gastrointestinal disorders. thus, an increased  cell concentration of b. longum subsp. infantis in the human gut could be considered of potential health benefit. in conclusion, wild blueberry consumption resulted in a specific bifidogenic effect that could positively affect certain populations of bifidobacteria with demonstrated health-promoting properties.

TI  == cholesterol-lowering probiotics: in vitro selection and in vivo testing of bifidobacteria.
AB  == thirty-four strains of bifidobacteria belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis,  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseu-docatenulatum were assayed in vitro for the ability to assimilate cholesterol and for bile salt hydrolase (bsh) against glycocholic and taurodeoxycholic acids (gca and tdca). cholesterol assimilation was peculiar characteristic of two strains belonging to the species  b. bifidum (b. bifidum mb 107 and b. bifidum mb 109), which removed 81 and 50 mg  of cholesterol per gram of biomass, being the median of specific cholesterol absorption by bifidobacteria 19 mg/g. significant differences in bsh activities were not established among bifidobacterial species. however, the screening resulted in the selection of promising strains able to efficiently deconjugate gca and tdca. no relationship was recognized between bsh phenotype and the extent of cholesterol assimilation. on the basis of cholesterol assimilation or bshgca and bshtdca activities, b. bifidum mb 109 (dsmz 23731), b. breve mb 113 (dsmz 23732), and b. animalis subsp. lactis mb 2409 (dsmz 23733) were combined in a probiotic mixture to be fed to hypercholesterolemic rats. the administration of this probiotic formulation resulted in a significant reduction of total cholesterol and low-density cholesterol (ldl-c), whereas it did not affect high-density cholesterol (hdl-c) and hdl-c/ldl-c ratio.

TI  == lacto-n-biosidase encoded by a novel gene of bifidobacterium longum subspecies longum shows unique substrate specificity and requires a designated chaperone for its active expression.
AB  == infant gut-associated bifidobacteria possess species-specific enzymatic sets to assimilate human milk oligosaccharides, and lacto-n-biosidase (lnbase) is a key enzyme that degrades lacto-n-tetraose (galbeta1-3glcnacbeta1-3galbeta1-4glc), the main component of human milk oligosaccharides, to lacto-n-biose i (galbeta1-3glcnac) and lactose. we have previously identified lnbase activity in  bifidobacterium bifidum and some strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum  (b. longum). subsequently, we isolated a glycoside hydrolase family 20 (gh20) lnbase from b. bifidum; however, the genome of the lnbase(+) strain of b. longum  contains no gh20 lnbase homolog. here, we reveal that locus tags bllj_1505 and bllj_1506 constitute lnbase from b. longum jcm1217. the gene products, designated lnbx and lnby, respectively, showed no sequence similarity to previously characterized proteins. the purified enzyme, which consisted of lnbx only, hydrolyzed via a retaining mechanism the glcnacbeta1-3gal linkage in lacto-n-tetraose, lacto-n-fucopentaose i (fucalpha1-2galbeta1-3glcnacbeta1-3galbeta1-4glc), and sialyllacto-n-tetraose a (neu5acalpha2-3galbeta1-3glcnacbeta1-3galbeta1-4gal); the latter two are not hydrolyzed by gh20 lnbase. among the chromogenic substrates examined, the enzyme  acted on p-nitrophenyl (pnp)-beta-lacto-n-bioside i (galbeta1-3glcnacbeta-pnp) and galnacbeta1-3glcnacbeta-pnp. galnacbeta1-3glcnacbeta linkage has been found in o-mannosyl glycans of alpha-dystroglycan. therefore, the enzyme may serve as a new tool for examining glycan structures. in vitro refolding experiments revealed that lnby and metal ions (ca(2+) and mg(2+)) are required for proper folding of lnbx. the lnbx and lnby homologs have been found only in b. bifidum, b. longum, and a few gut microbes, suggesting that the proteins have evolved in specialized  niches.

AB  == the aim of the study was to compare the compositions of the fecal microbiotas of  infants fed goat milk formula to those of infants fed cow milk formula or breast  milk as the gold standard. pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene sequences was used in  the analysis of the microbiotas in stool samples collected from 90 australian babies (30 in each group) at 2 months of age. beta-diversity analysis of total microbiota sequences and lachnospiraceae sequences revealed that they were more similar in breast milk/goat milk comparisons than in breast milk/cow milk comparisons. the lachnospiraceae were mostly restricted to a single species (ruminococcus gnavus) in breast milk-fed and goat milk-fed babies compared to a more diverse collection in cow milk-fed babies. bifidobacteriaceae were abundant  in the microbiotas of infants in all three groups. bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum were the most commonly detected bifidobacterial species. a semiquantitative pcr method was devised to differentiate between b. longum subsp. longum and b. longum subsp. infantis and was used to test stool samples. b. longum subsp. infantis was seldom present in stools, even of breast milk-fed babies. the presence of b. bifidum in the stools  of breast milk-fed infants at abundances greater than 10% of the total microbiota was associated with the highest total abundances of bifidobacteriaceae. when bifidobacteriaceae abundance was low, lachnospiraceae abundances were greater. new information about the composition of the fecal microbiota when goat milk formula is used in infant nutrition was thus obtained.

AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == isolation of a bifidogenic peptide from the pepsin hydrolysate of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in the milk of most mammals for which various biological functions have been reported, such as antimicrobial activity and bifidogenic activity. in this study, we compared the bifidogenic activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf) and pepsin hydrolysate of blf (blfh), isolated bifidogenic peptide from blfh, and investigated the bifidogenic spectra  of blf, blfh, and its active peptide against 42 bifidobacterial strains comprising nine species. against bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700(t), minimal effective concentrations of blf and blfh were 300 and 10 mug/ml. against bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697(t), the minimal effective concentration of blfh was 30 mug/ml, and blf did not show bifidogenic activity within 300 mug/ml. as an active peptide, a heterodimer of a(1)-w(16) and l(43)-a(48) linked by a disulfide bond was isolated. previously, this peptide was identified as having antibacterial activity. an amino acid mixture with the same  composition as this peptide showed no bifidogenic activity. the strains of each species whose growth was highly promoted (>150%) by this peptide at 3.75 mum were as follows: b. breve (7 out of 7 strains [7/7]), b. longum subsp. infantis (5/5), bifidobacterium bifidum (2/5), b. longum subsp. longum (1/3), bifidobacterium adolescentis (3/6), bifidobacterium catenulatum (1/4), bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (0/4), bifidobacterium dentium (0/5), and bifidobacterium angulatum (0/3). growth of none of the strains was highly promoted by blf at 3.75 mum. we demonstrated that blfh showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural  blf, especially against infant-representative species, b. breve and b. longum subsp. infantis; furthermore, we isolated its active peptide. this is the first report about a bifidogenic peptide derived from blf.

TI  == long-term changes in human colonic bifidobacterium populations induced by a 5-day oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess the possible modifications due to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amc) treatment on total bacteria and on bifidobacterium species balance in human colonic microbiota. eighteen healthy volunteers (19 to 36 years old) were given a 875/125 mg dose of amc twice a day for 5 days. fecal samples were obtained before and after antibiotic exposure. after total dna extraction, total bacteria and bifidobacteria were specifically quantified using real-time pcr. dominant species were monitored over time using bacterial and bifidobacterial temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). at the end of amc exposure, total bacterial concentrations as well as bifidobacteria concentrations were significantly reduced compared to before amc exposure:10.7+/-0.1 log(10) 16s rrna gene copies/g vs 11.1+/-0.1 log(10) (p = 0.003) and 8.1+/-0.5 log(10) 16s rrna gene copies/g vs 9.4+/-0.3 log(10) (p = 0.003), respectively. at the same time, the mean similarity percentages of ttge bacteria and ttge bifidobacteria profiles were significantly reduced compared to  before amc exposure: 51.6%+/-3.5% vs 81.4%+/-2.1% and 55.8%+/-7.6% vs 84.5%+/-4.1%, respectively. occurrence of b. adolescentis, b. bifidum and b. pseudocatenulatum/b. catenulatum species significantly decreased. occurrence of b. longum remained stable. moreover, the number of distinct bifidobacterium species per sample significantly decreased (1.5+/-0.3 vs 2.3+/-0.3; p = 0.01). two months after amc exposure, the mean similarity percentage of ttge profiles was 55.6% for bacteria and 62.3% for bifidobacteria. these results clearly demonstrated that a common antibiotic treatment may qualitatively alter the colonic microbiota. such modifications may have potential long-term physiological consequences.

TI  == breast milk jaundice: effect of bacteria present in breast milk and infant feces.
AB  == objective: breast milk is an important source of bacteria in establishing the infantile intestinal microbiota that appear to influence the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of breast milk's microbiological content on the development of breast milk jaundice (bmj). methods: a total number of 60 mother-infant pairs enrolled to the study. two groups were defined: bmj group (n=30), full-term otherwise healthy newborns who were considered bmj; control group (n=30), full-term healthy newborns without jaundice. all newborns in the study were exclusively breast-fed. the breast milk samples and the feces of infants were evaluated for content of selected bacterial populations (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, clostridium, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species) with real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: bifidobacterium bifidum content in the breast milk and b adolescentis, b bifidum, and b longum content in the fecal samples were higher in the control group than in the bmj group. the milk and fecal concentrations of b bifidum were significantly correlated. the concentrations of breast milk b bifidum and fecal b bifidum, b adolescentis, and b longum were found to be negatively correlated with bilirubin levels. conclusions: our results suggest that bifidobacterium species in breast milk may protect against bmj.

TI  == bifidobacterial succession and correlation networks in a large unselected cohort  of mothers and their children.
AB  == bifidobacteria are a major microbial component of infant gut microbiota, which is believed to promote health benefits for the host and stimulate maturation of the  immune system. despite their perceived importance, very little is known about the natural development of and possible correlations between bifidobacteria in human  populations. to address this knowledge gap, we analyzed stool samples from a randomly selected healthy cohort of 87 infants and their mothers with >90% of vaginal delivery and nearly 100% breast-feeding at 4 months. fecal material was sampled during pregnancy, at 3 and 10 days, at 4 months, and at 1 and 2 years after birth. stool samples were predicted to be rich in the species bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. dentium, b. breve, and b. longum. due to high variation, we did not identify a clear age-related structure at the individual level. within the population as a whole, however, there were clear age-related successions. negative correlations between the b. longum group and b. adolescentis were detected in adults and in 1- and 2-year-old children, whereas negative correlations between b. longum and b. breve were characteristic for newborns and 4-month-old infants. the highly structured age-related development of and correlation networks between bifidobacterial species during the first 2 years of life mirrors their different or competing nutritional requirements, which in turn may be associated with specific biological functions in the development of healthy gut.

TI  == bifidobacterial alpha-galactosidase with unique carbohydrate-binding module specifically acts on blood group b antigen.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum is one of the most frequently found bifidobacteria in the intestines of newborn infants. we previously reported that b. bifidum possesses unique metabolic pathways for o-linked glycans on gastrointestinal mucin (yoshida e, sakurama h, kiyohara m, nakajima m, kitaoka m, ashida h, hirose j, katayama t, yamamoto k, kumagai h. 2012. bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis uses two different beta-galactosidases for selectively degrading type-1 and type-2 human milk oligosaccharides. glycobiology. 22:361-368). the nonreducing termini of o-linked glycans on mucin are frequently covered with histo-blood group antigens. here, we identified a gene agabb from b. bifidum jcm 1254, which encodes glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 110 alpha-galactosidase. agabb is a 1289-amino acid polypeptide containing an n-terminal signal sequence, a gh110 domain, a carbohydrate-binding module (cbm) 51 domain, a bacterial ig-like (big) 2 domain and a c-terminal transmembrane region, in this order. the recombinant enzyme expressed in escherichia coli hydrolyzed alpha1,3-linked gal in branched blood group b antigen [galalpha1-3(fucalpha1-2)galbeta1-r], but not in a linear xenotransplantation antigen (galalpha1-3galbeta1-r). the enzyme also acted on group b human salivary mucin and erythrocytes. we also revealed that cbm51 specifically bound blood group b antigen using both isothermal titration calorimetry and a solid-phase binding assay, and it enhanced the affinity of the  enzyme toward substrates with multivalent b antigens. we suggest that this enzyme plays an important role in degrading b antigens to acquire nutrients from mucin oligosaccharides in the gastrointestinal tracts.

TI  == modulation of phenotypic and functional maturation of dendritic cells by intestinal bacteria and gliadin: relevance for celiac disease.
AB  == dc maturation and functions are influenced by microbial and environmental stimuli, which could contribute to immune dysfunction. here, we have investigated the role of enterobacteria (escherichia coli cbl2 and shigella cbd8) isolated from cd patients, bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum cect 7347 and bifidobacterium bifidum cect 7365), and gliadins on phenotypic and functional features of mddcs and in coculture with caco-2 cells. the ultimate goal of our study is to understand the roles played by specific components of the gut microbiota in cd. enterobacteria induced marked alterations in mddc morphology, inducing podosome dissolution and dendrites, and activated mddc adhesion and spreading. enterobacteria also induced inflammatory cytokine production (ifn-gamma, tnf-alpha, and il-12), partially resembling the gliadin-induced th1-type cytokine profile. b. longum cect 7347 and b. bifidum cect 7365 induced minor mddc morphological changes and activated adhesion and spreading and inflammatory cytokine production to a lesser extent compared with enterobacteria. b. longum cect 7347 also induced lower cd86 and cd40 expression on mddcs than the two enterobacteria. the aforementioned bifidobacterial strain also reduced gliadin-induced ifn-gamma production and increased il-10 secretion when both stimuli were combined. similar trends were detected for mddcs cocultured with caco-2 cells. b. longum cect 7347 reversed the gliadin-reduced zo-1 expression in caco-2 cells. thus, our results suggest that specific components of the gut microbiota may influence phenotypic and functional maturation of dcs differently  and their interactions with epithelial cells. this could ultimately define the role of dcs in cd progression.

AB  == background: bifidobacteria belong to one of the predominant bacterial groups in the intestinal microbiota of infants and adults. several beneficial effects on the health status of their human hosts have been demonstrated making bifidobacteria interesting candidates for probiotic applications. adhesion of probiotics to the intestinal epithelium is discussed as a prerequisite for colonisation of and persistence in the gastrointestinal tract. results: in the present study, 15 different strains of bifidobacteria were tested for adhesion. b. bifidum was identified as the species showing highest adhesion to all tested intestinal epithelial cell (iec) lines. adhesion of b. bifidum s17 to iecs was strongly reduced after treatment of bacteria with pronase. these results strongly indicate that a proteinaceous cell surface component mediates adhesion of b. bifidum s17 to iecs. in silico analysis of the currently accessible bifidobacterium genomes identified bopa encoding a lipoprotein as a b. bifidum-specific gene previously shown to function as an adhesin of b. bifidum mimbb75. the in silico results were confirmed by southern blot analysis. furthermore, northern blot analysis demonstrated that bopa is expressed in all b. bifidum strains tested under conditions used to cultivate bacteria for adhesion assays. the bopa gene was successfully expressed in e. coli and purified by ni-nta affinity chromatography as a c-terminal his6-fusion. purified bopa had an  inhibitory effect on adhesion of b. bifidum s17 to iecs. moreover, bopa was successfully expressed in b. bifidum s17 and b. longum/infantis e18. strains overexpressing bopa showed enhanced adhesion to iecs, clearly demonstrating a role of bopa in adhesion of b. bifidum strains. conclusions: bopa was identified  as a b. bifidum-specific protein involved in adhesion to iecs. bifidobacterium strains expressing bopa show enhanced adhesion. our results represent the first report on recombinant bifidobacteria with improved adhesive properties.

AB  == galacto-oligosaccharides (gos) are considered to be prebiotic, although the contribution of specific members of the microbiota to gos fermentation and the exact microbial metabolites that are produced upon gos fermentation are largely unknown. we aimed to determine this using uniformly (13)c-labeled gos. the normal (control) medium and unlabeled or (13)c-labeled gos was added to a dynamic, validated, in vitro model of the large-intestine containing an adult-type microbiota. liquid-chromatography ms was used to measure the incorporation of (13)c label into metabolites. 16s-rrna stable isotope probing coupled to a phylogenetic micro-array was used to determine label incorporation in microbial biomass. the primary members within the complex microbiota that were directly involved in gos fermentation were shown to be bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b. catenulatum, lactobacillus gasseri, and l. salivarius, in line with the prebiotic effect of gos, although some other species incorporated (13)c label also. gos fermentation led to an increase in acetate (+49%) and lactate (+23%) compared with the control. total organic acid production was 8.50 and 7.52 mmol/g of carbohydrate fed for the gos and control experiments, respectively. at the same time, the cumulative production of putrefactive metabolites (branched-chain  fatty acids and ammonia) was reduced by 55%. cross-feeding of metabolites from primary gos fermenters to other members of the microbiota was observed. our findings support a prebiotic role for gos and its potential to act as a synbiotic in combination with certain probiotic strains.

TI  == bifidobacterial enzymes involved in the metabolism of human milk oligosaccharides.
AB  == intestinal colonization of bifidobacteria is important for the health of infants. human milk oligosaccharides (hmo) have been identified as growth factors for bifidobacteria. recently, a bifidobacterial enzymatic system to metabolize hmo was identified. 1,3-beta-galactosyl-n-acetylhexosamine phosphorylase (glnbp, ec 2.4.1.211), which catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of galacto-n-biose (gnb) (galbeta1-->3galnac)] and lacto-n-biose i (lnb) (galbeta1-->3glcnac), is a  key enzyme to explain the metabolism of hmo. infant-type bifidobacteria possess the intracellular pathway to specifically metabolize gnb and lnb (gnb/lnb pathway). bifidobacterium bifidum possesses extracellular enzymes to liberate lnb from hmo. however, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis imports intact hmo to be hydrolyzed by intracellular enzymes. bifidobacterial enzymes related to the metabolism of hmo are useful tools for preparing compounds related to hmo. for instance, lnb and gnb were produced from sucrose and glcnac/galnac in 1 pot using 4 bifidobacterial enzymes, including glnbp. lnb is expected to be a selective bifidus factor for infant-type strains.

AB  == human milk (hm) contains as the third most abundant component around 200 different structures of human milk oligosaccharides (hmos). hmos are the first and irreplaceable prebiotics for infants, supporting bifidobacteria as the most important bacterial group in an infant intestine. the aim of our study was to test the growth of bifidobacteria in hm and on hmos. bifidobacteria were isolated from two groups of infants. the first one (eight strains) were isolated from infants who had bifidobacteria in their feces but, after a short period of time (4 to 24 days), bifidobacteria were no longer detected in their feces (disappeared bifidobacteria [db]). the second group of bifidobacteria (eight strains) originated from infants with continual presence of bifidobacteria in their feces (persistent bifidobacteria [pb]). there were significant differences  (p < 0.05) between db and pb groups in the ability of the strains to grow in hm.  pb grew in hm, reaching counts higher than 7 log cfu/ml. in contrast, counts of db decreased from 5 to 4.3 log cfu/ml after cultivation in hm. the final ph after cultivation of bifidobacteria on hmos was 6.2 and 4.9 in dp and pb groups, respectively. in general, bifidobacterium bifidum and b. breve species were able  to utilize hmos, while b. adolescentis and b. longum subsp. longum species did not. the ability to grow in hm and to utilize hmos seem to be important properties of bifidobacteria which are able to colonize infant intestinal tract.

TI  == bifidobacteria isolated from infants and cultured on human milk oligosaccharides  affect intestinal epithelial function.
AB  == objectives: human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are the third most abundant component of breast milk. our laboratory has previously revealed gene clusters specifically linked to hmo metabolism in selected bifidobacteria isolated from fecal samples of infants. our objective was to test the hypothesis that growth of selected bifidobacteria on hmo stimulates the intestinal epithelium. methods: caco-2 and ht-29 cells were incubated with lactose (lac)- or hmo-grown bifidobacterium longum subsp infantis (b infantis) or b bifidum. bacterial adhesion and translocation were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and tight junction proteins was analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptase. distribution of tight junction proteins was measured using immunofluorescent microscopy. results: we showed that hmo-grown b infantis had a significantly higher rate of adhesion to ht-29 cells compared with b bifidum. b infantis also induced expression of a cell membrane glycoprotein, p-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1. both b infantis and b bifidum grown on hmo caused less occludin relocalization and higher expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 compared with lac-grown bacteria in caco-2 cells. b bifidum grown on hmo showed higher expression of junctional adhesion molecule and occludin in caco-2 cells and ht-29 cells. there were no significant differences between lac or hmo treatments in bacterial translocation. conclusions: the study provides evidence for the specific relation between hmo-grown bifidobacteria and intestinal epithelial cells. to our knowledge, this is the first study describing hmo-induced changes in the bifidobacteria-intestinal cells interaction.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis gcl2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (b. lactis) gcl2505 (gcl2505) in the intestine after administration of gcl2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. an increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. longum, b. adolescentis, b. anglatum, b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. dentium, b. longum subsp. infantis and b. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of gcl2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis. however, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding b. lactis) remained unchanged. b. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. taking into account the number of gcl2505 administered, the findings further suggested that gcl2505 proliferated in the intestine. in addition, the defecation frequency increased during gcl2505 administration compared with the placebo. moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that gcl2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. this is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.

TI  == bifidobacterium bifidum ncc 453 promotes tolerance induction in murine models of  sublingual immunotherapy.
AB  == background: enhancing clinical efficacy remains a major goal in allergen-specific immunotherapy. in this study, we tested three strains of bifidobacteria as candidate adjuvants for sublingual allergy vaccines. methods: probiotic candidates were evaluated in human monocyte-derived dendritic cell (h-dc) maturation and cd4(+) t-cell polarization in vitro models and further tested in murine models of sublingual immunotherapy in balb/c mice sensitized to either ovalbumin or birch pollen. results: bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum and  b. longum induced h-dc maturation and polarized naive cd4(+) t cells toward interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 production. b. bifidum increased cd25(high),  foxp3(+) cells within cd4(+) t lymphocytes and was the most potent inducer of interferon-gamma in th2-skewed peripheral blood mononuclear cells and h-dc t-cell cocultures. it also induced a significant decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness  in balb/c mice sensitized to ovalbumin. sublingual administration of b. bifidum together with recombinant bet v 1 enhanced tolerance induction in balb/c mice sensitized to birch pollen, with a downregulation of both airway hyperresponsiveness, lung inflammation and bet v 1-specific th2 responses. conclusions: due to its capacity to reorient established th2 responses toward th1/regulatory t-cell profiles, b. bifidum represents a valid candidate adjuvant  for specific immunotherapy of type i allergies.

TI  == real-time pcr analysis of the intestinal microbiotas in peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  == bifidobacterium and lactobacillus can beneficially affect the host by producing acetic acid and lactic acid, which lower ph and thereby inhibit the growth of pathogens or allow the probiotic bacteria to compete with pathogens for epithelial adhesion sites and nutrients. the transmural migration of enteric organisms into the peritoneal cavity can cause peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis (pd) patients. we hypothesized that the composition of the intestinal microbiota  with regard to lactobacillus species and bifidobacterium species differed between pd patients and healthy controls. the aim of the study was to investigate these differences by real-time pcr analysis of fecal samples. from 1 august 2009 to 31  march 2010, a total of 29 nondiabetic pd patients and 41 healthy controls from china medical university hospital were recruited after giving their informed consent. fecal samples were collected from the pd patients and their age-matched  counterparts in the morning using a standardized procedure. dna extracted from these samples was analyzed by real-time pcr. all bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium  catenulatum, b. longum, b. bifidum, lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei, and klebsiella pneumoniae were less frequently detected in the patient samples. dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) may impair intestinal barrier function and increase host vulnerability to pathogen invasion. further studies are necessary to confirm our findings before clinical trials with probiotic supplementation in  pd patients.

TI  == comparative effects of six probiotic strains on immune function in vitro.
AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

AB  == background: cell surface pili in gram positive bacteria have been reported to orchestrate the colonization of host tissues, evasion of immunity and the development of biofilms. so far, little if any information is available on the presence of pilus-like structures in human gut commensals like bifidobacteria. results and discussion: in this report, atomic force microscopy (afm) of various  bifidobacterial strains belonging to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis revealed the existence of appendages resembling pilus-like structures. interestingly, these microorganisms harbour two to six predicted pilus gene clusters in their genome, with each organized in an operon encompassing the major pilin subunit-encoding gene (designated fima or fimp) together with one or two minor pilin subunit-encoding genes (designated as  fimb and/or fimq), and a gene encoding a sortase enzyme (stra). quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr analysis and rt-pcr experiments revealed a polycistronic mrna, encompassing the fima/p and fimb/q genes, which are differentially expressed upon cultivation of bifidobacteria on various glycans.

TI  == influence of mother's intestinal microbiota on gut colonization in the infant.
AB  == the aim here was to elucidate the mother-infant association in the gut colonization of 1-6 month-old infants and to establish whether probiotics can influence this process. fecal samples from 80 mother-infant pairs were analyzed at 1 month (mothers and infants) and 6 months (infants) by real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess bacterial numbers. this double-blind placebo-controlled  trial involved 2 different probiotic combinations (1. lactobacillus rhamnosus + bifidobacterium longum and 2. lactobacillus paracasei + bifidobacterium longum) given to the mothers 2 months prior to and 2 months after delivery. bifidobacterium bifidum colonization in the mothers significantly increased the infants' probability of being colonized by b. bifidum and their bifidobacterial diversity indexes (di) and the mother-infant similarity indexes (si) both at 1 and 6 months of age. the counts of bifidobacterium genus (at 1 month) and bifidobacterium longum (at 6 months) correlated between mothers and infants. at 6 months, a significant effect of the probiotic intervention was found in the mother-infant association of fecal bifidobacterial counts but not in the colonization frequencies, di or si. in conclusion, a clear association between mother and infant was found in gut colonization by bifidobacteria. maternal colonization by b. bifidum had the most consistent effects on the infant's bifidobacterial microbiota. maternal probiotic treatment had little effect on this mother-infant association.

TI  == arabinoxylans and inulin differentially modulate the mucosal and luminal gut microbiota and mucin-degradation in humanized rats.
AB  == the endogenous gut microbiota affects the host in many ways. prebiotics should favour beneficial intestinal microbes and thus improve host health. in this study, we investigated how a novel class of potential prebiotic long-chain arabinoxylans (lc-ax) and the well-established prebiotic inulin (in) modulate the gut microbiota of humanized rats. six weeks after axenic rats were inoculated with a human faecal microbiota, their colonic microbiota was similar to this inoculum ( approximately 70%), whereas their caecal microbiota was enriched with  verrucomicrobia and firmicutes concomitant with lower abundance of bacteroidetes. moreover, different bifidobacterium species colonized the lumen (b. adolescentis) and mucus (b. longum and b. bifidum). both lc-ax and in increased scfa levels and induced a shift from acetate towards health-promoting propionate and butyrate respectively. by applying a high-resolution phylogenetic micro-array (hitchip) at the site of fermentation (caecum), in and lc-ax were shown to stimulate bacterial groups with known butyrate-producers (roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, anaerostipes caccae) and bifidobacteria (b. longum) respectively. prebiotic administration also resulted in lower caecal abundances of the mucin-degrading akkermansia muciniphila and potentially more mucin production by  the host. both factors might explain the increased caecal mucin levels for lc-ax  (threefold) and in (sixfold). these mucins were degraded along the colon, resulting in high faecal abundances of akkermansia muciniphila for lc-ax and especially in-treated rats. finally, the microbial changes caused an adaptation period for the host with less weight gain, after which the host fine-tuned the interaction with this altered microbiota. our results demonstrate that next to in, lc-ax are promising prebiotic compounds by stimulating production of health-promoting metabolites by specific microbes in the proximal regions. further, prebiotic supplementation shifted mucin degradation to distal regions, where mucin-degraders may produce beneficial metabolites (e.g. propionate by akkermansia muciniphila), so that prebiotics may potentially improve gut health along the entire length of the intestine.

TI  == physiology of consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by infant gut-associated bifidobacteria.
AB  == the bifidogenic effect of human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) has long been known, yet the precise mechanism underlying it remains unresolved. recent studies show that some species/subspecies of bifidobacterium are equipped with genetic and enzymatic sets dedicated to the utilization of hmos, and consequently they can grow on hmos; however, the ability to metabolize hmos has not been directly linked to the actual metabolic behavior of the bacteria. in this report, we clarify the fate of each hmo during cultivation of infant gut-associated bifidobacteria. bifidobacterium bifidum jcm1254, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis jcm1222, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum jcm1217, and bifidobacterium breve jcm1192 were selected for this purpose and were grown on hmo media containing a main neutral oligosaccharide fraction. the mono- and oligosaccharides in the spent media were labeled with 2-anthranilic acid, and their concentrations were determined at various incubation times using normal phase high performance liquid chromatography. the results reflect the metabolic abilities of the respective bifidobacteria. b. bifidum used secretory glycosidases to degrade hmos, whereas b. longum subsp. infantis assimilated all hmos by incorporating them in their intact forms. b. longum subsp. longum and b.  breve consumed lacto-n-tetraose only. interestingly, b. bifidum left degraded hmo metabolites outside of the cell even when the cells initiate vegetative growth, which indicates that the different species/subspecies can share the produced sugars. the predominance of type 1 chains in hmos and the preferential use of type 1 hmo by infant gut-associated bifidobacteria suggest the coevolution of the bacteria with humans.

TI  == the role of components of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in pathogenesis and serologic diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid diseases.
AB  == during recent years, researchers have been focusing on the concept of an infectious etiology of autoimmune diseases. the most discussed theory is molecular mimicry, i.e. the emergence of autoreactive clones of t- and b-lymphocytes as a result of cross-immune response to homologous bacterial or viral antigen. information on the role of probiotic microorganisms (pm) in the molecular mechanisms of autoimmune thyroid diseases (atd) is limited. using proteins and immunogenic peptides databanks and relevant computer programs, the homology between the amino acid sequences of thyroid peroxidase (tpo) and thyroglobulin (tg), which are potential b- and t-cell epitopes of these antigens, and proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was established. moreover, we have found components of cells of bifidobacterium bifidum 791, bifidobacterium adolescentis 94 bim, bifidobacterium longum b379m and lactobacillus plantarum b-01 that selectively bind human antibodies to tpo (anti-tpo) and antibodies to tg (anti-tg) and compete with natural antigens for the binding of anti-tpo and anti-tg in elisa. additionally, a three-fold difference was observed between the  probability of detecting antibodies (abs) to the antigens of l. plantarum b-01 and b. bifidum 791 in serum samples containing and those not containing anti-tpo. on the whole, our data are arguments in favour of the assumption of the possible  role of pm of the genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in triggering atd by the mechanism of molecular mimicry. the data obtained in silico and in vitro should be proven by use of animal models and clinical studies for extrapolations  to the whole body. possible antigenic properties of components/proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, selectively binding anti-tpo and anti-tg should  be taken into consideration. natural human abs to these bacterial components are  probably able to cross-react with the tpo and tg in the elisa for detection of anti-tpo and anti-tg, which are serologic markers of atd. it can lead to unspecific false positive results and, hence, to an incorrect diagnosis.

TI  == use of tuf gene-based primers for the pcr detection of probiotic bifidobacterium  species and enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented milk by cultural and quantitative real-time pcr methods.
AB  == due to the increasing use of bifidobacteria in probiotic products, it is essential to establish a rapid method for the qualitative and quantitative assay  of the bifidobacteria in commercial products. in this study, partial sequences of the tuf gene for 18 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 14 species were determined. alignment of these sequences showed that the similarities among these bifidobacterium species were 82.24% to 99.72%. based on these tuf gene sequences, 6 primer sets were designed for the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay of b. animalis subsp. animalis, b. animalis subsp. lactis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. longum subsp. longum, and the genus of bifidobacterium, respectively. these bifidobacterium species are common probiotic species present in dairy and probiotic products. when each target bifidobacterium spp. was assayed with the designed primers, pcr product with expected size was generated. in addition, for each target species, more than 70 bacterial strains other than the target species, including strains of other bifidobacterium species, strains of lactobacillus spp., enterococcus spp., and other bacterial species, all generated negative results. pcr assay with primers specific to b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. longum confirmed the presence of these bifidobacterium species in commercial yogurt products. in addition, for each product, enumeration of the bifidobacteria cells by culture method with bim-25 agar and the quantitative real-time pcr showed similar cell counts. such results indicated that within 15-d storage (4 degrees c) after manufacture, all the bifidobacteria cells originally present in yogurt products were viable and culturable during the storage.

TI  == an exo-alpha-sialidase from bifidobacteria involved in the degradation of sialyloligosaccharides in human milk and intestinal glycoconjugates.
AB  == bifidobacteria are health-promoting enteric commensals that are assumed to proliferate predominantly in the intestines of breast-fed infants by assimilating human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) that are frequently fucosylated and/or sialylated. we previously identified two different alpha-l-fucosidases in bifidobacterium bifidum and showed that the strain furnishes an extracellular degradation pathway for fucosylated hmos. however, the catabolism of sialylated hmos by bifidobacteria has remained unresolved. here we describe the identification and characterization of an exo-alpha-sialidase in bifidobacteria.  by expression cloning, we isolated a novel exo-alpha-sialidase gene (siabb2) from b. bifidum jcm1254, which encodes a protein (siabb2) consisting of 835-amino-acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 87 kda. siabb2 possesses an n-terminal signal sequence, a sialidase catalytic domain classified into the glycoside hydrolase family 33 (gh33) and a c-terminal transmembrane region, indicating that the mature siabb2 is an extracellular membrane-anchored enzyme. the recombinant enzyme expressed in escherichia coli showed the highest activity  in an acidic ph range from 4.0 to 5.0, and at 50 degrees c. notably, 80% activity remained after 30 min incubation at 80 degrees c, indicating that the enzyme is highly thermostable. siabb2 liberated sialic acids from sialyloligosaccharides, gangliosides, glycoproteins and colominic acid; however, the linkage preference of the enzyme was remarkably biased toward the alpha2,3-linkage rather than alpha2,6- and alpha2,8-linkages. expression of siabb2 in b. longum 105-a, which has no endogenous exo-alpha-sialidase, enabled this strain to degrade sialyloligosaccharides present in human milk. our results suggest that siabb2 plays a crucial role in bifidobacterial catabolism of sialylated hmos.

TI  == dietary glycosaminoglycans interfere in bacterial adhesion and gliadin-induced pro-inflammatory response in intestinal epithelial (caco-2) cells.
AB  == dietary components may have an important role in maintaining a balanced gut microbiota composition. celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gliadins, and has been associated with a reduced proportion of bifidobacterium in gut microbiota. this study evaluates the influence of glycosaminoglycans (gags) on bacterial adhesion and their contribution in the gliadins-induced inflammatory response. the adhesion of potential probiotic (bifidobacterium longum cect 7347 and bifidobacterium bifidum cect 7365), commensal (escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis) and pathogenic (salmonella enterica cect 443 and listeria monocytogenes cect 935) bacteria to mucin and caco-2 cell cultures was determined. gliadins were subjected to in vitro digestion (pepsin/pancreatin-bile), with/out gags, and the presence or not of cell suspensions of b. longum (10(8) cfu/ml). b. longum, e. coli, and l. monocytogenes, markedly interact with the high-sulphur-containing fraction of gags. the gags reduced the gliadins-mediated production of interleukin-1beta, but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha. the results suggest that gags may ameliorate gliadin-induced inflammatory response, though they also slightly interfere with the action of b. longum.

TI  == dissimilarity in the occurrence of bifidobacteriaceae in vaginal and perianal microbiota in women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == recent data point at the similarity between the perianal and vaginal microflora in terms of lactobacillus species involved. bacterial vaginosis, the most common  perturbation of the vaginal microflora involving primarily overgrowth of gardnerella vaginalis, has also been suggested to involve a recto-vaginal pathway. we addressed this issue with regard to bacteria of the bifidobacteriaceae family. in particular, we investigated the putative concordance of the presence of g. vaginalis and a series of bifidobacteria between the perianal and vaginal microflora in 10 patients with bacterial vaginosis through multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of desquamated epithelial cells. g. vaginalis was found in a biofilm mode of growth  at the perianal and vaginal sites. in most women at least one of the following species was detected perianally: bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breves, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. at the vaginal site, none of these bifidobacteria was found. we conclude that bacterial vaginosis does not occur as a result of simple growth per continuum of perianal bacteria. only some species originating from the intestinal tract do display pronounced vaginotropism, like g. vaginalis, whereas many other  species do not.

TI  == amoxicillin treatment modifies the composition of bifidobacterium species in infant intestinal microbiota.
AB  == objectives: amoxicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic largely used in childhood. however only few studies described its impact on composition of children gut microbiota, in particular on bifidobacterium populations considered as beneficial microorganisms. in this study, the impact on faecal bifidobacterium species of a  seven-day amoxicillin treatment was quantitatively and qualitatively assessed in  infants during an episode of acute respiratory infection. methods: faecal samples from 31 infants were obtained on day 0 (just before amoxicillin therapy) and on day 7 (the end of therapy). total dna was extracted and bifidobacteria were quantified using real-time pcr. predominant bifidobacterium species were then identified using specific pcr-ttge. results: bifidobacteria concentrations were not significantly altered by amoxicillin compared to the healthy group. however,  amoxicillin treatment induced a complete disappearance of bifidobacterium adolescentis species (occurrence rate of 0% versus 36.4% in healthy group, p < 0.001), a significant decrease in the occurrence rate of bifidobacterium bifidum  (23% versus 54.5% in healthy group, p < 0.05), but did not affect bifidobacterium longum (93.5% versus 100% in healthy group) and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum/b. catenulatum (about 55% in both groups). the number of bifidobacterium species per microbiota significantly decreased from 2.5 +/- 1 for healthy group to 1.8 +/- 0.9 for treated infants (p < 0.05). conclusions: this study showed that a 7 day amoxicillin treatment did not alter the counts of bifidobacterium. however amoxicillin can have an impact by changing the microbiota at the species level and decreased the diversity of this population.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

TI  == use of d(acid)-, d(bile)-, z(acid)-, and z(bile)-values in evaluating bifidobacteria with regard to stomach ph and bile salt sensitivity.
AB  == the survival of bifidobacteria in simulated conditions of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract was studied based on the d- and z-value concept. some bifidobacterium  spp. are probiotics that improve microbial balance in the human gi tract. because they are sensitive to low ph and bile salt concentrations, their viability in the gi tract is limited. the d- and z-value approach was therefore adopted as a result of observing constant log-cell reduction (90%) when bifidobacterium spp. were exposed to these 2 different stressing factors. survivals of one strain each or 4 species of bifidobacterium was studied at ph between 3.0 and 4.5 and in ox-bile between 0.15% and 0.60% for times up to 41 h. from the d(acid)- and d(bile)-values, the order of resistance to acid and bile was b. bifidum > b. infantis > b. longum > b. adolescentis. while the former 3 strains retained high  cell viability at ph 3.5 (>5.5 log cfu/ml after 5 h) and at elevated bile salt concentration of 0.6% (>4.5 log cfu/ml after 3 h), b. adolescentis was less resistant (<3.4 log cfu/ml). the z(acid)- and z(bile)-values calculated from the  d(acid)- and d(bile)-values ranged from 1.11 to 1.55 ph units and 0.40% to 0.49%, respectively. the results suggest that the d(acid)-, d(bile)-, z(acid)-, and z(bile)-value approach could be more appropriate than the screening and selection method in evaluating survival of probiotic bacteria, and in measuring their tolerance or resistance to gastric acidity and the associated bile salt concentration in the small intestine. practical application: the evaluation of the tolerance of bifidobacteria to bile salts and low ph has been made possible by use of d- and z-value concept. the calculated z(acid)- and z(bile)-values were all fairly similar for the strains used and suggest the effect of increasing the  bile salt concentration or decreasing the ph on the d(acid)- and d(bile)-values.  this approach would be useful for predicting the suitability of bifidobacteria and other lactic acid bacteria (lab) as probiotics for use in real-life situations.

TI  == distinct bifidobacterium strains drive different immune responses in vitro.
AB  == in this work we evaluated the specific immune activation properties of different  bifidobacterium strains, some of the most relevant intestinal microorganisms. to  this end, we examined the in vitro effect of 12 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 4 different species, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, on the maturation pattern of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (dcs), as well as in their ability to induce cytokine secretion. in addition, we determined peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) proliferation and cytokine expression after exposure to bacterial strains. all bifidobacteria tested were able to induce full dc maturation but showed differences in the levels of cytokine production, especially il-12, il-10, tnfalpha and il-1beta, suggesting that specific cytokine ratios could be used to predict the type of th response that they may promote. in fact, analysis of cytokine production by pbmc showed that most of the tested b. animalis and b. longum strains induced the secretion of large amounts of ifngamma and tnfalpha, in agreement with the th1 profile suggested by dc cytokine production. remarkably, three of four b. bifidum strains induced poor secretion of these cytokines and significant amounts of il-17, the main product of th17 cells, in accordance with the high il-1beta/il-12 ratio observed after dc stimulation. in conclusion, this work shows species and strain-specific immune effects of bifidobacteria and describes a valuable method for screening possible  probiotic strains with different immunomodulatory properties. notably, some b. bifidum strains seem to promote th17 polarization, which could be useful for future probiotic applications.

TI  == species delineation and clonal diversity in four bifidobacterium species as revealed by multilocus sequencing.
AB  == the genus bifidobacterium comprises several species that are important contributors to the gut microbiome, with some strains having beneficial health effects. understanding the evolutionary emergence of advantageous biological properties requires knowledge of the genetic diversity and clonal structure of species. we sequenced seven housekeeping genes in 119 bifidobacterium strains of  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum. phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences delineated sequence clusters that correspond to previously named taxa, and suggested that b. longum subsp. infantis is a nascent lineage emerging from within b. longum subsp. longum. clear traces of recombination among distant bifidobacterial species indicate leaky species borders and warn against the practice of single gene-based identification. multilocus sequence typing achieved precise strain genotyping, with discrimination indices above 99% in b. bifidum, b. breve and b. longum, providing a powerful tool for strain traceability, colonization dynamics and ecological studies. frequent homologous recombination accelerates clonal diversification and may facilitate the transfer of biological  properties among bifidobacterial strains.

TI  == bifidobacteria inhibit the inflammatory response induced by gliadins in intestinal epithelial cells via modifications of toxic peptide generation during  digestion.
AB  == celiac disease (cd) is a chronic enteropathy triggered by intake of gliadin, the  toxic component of gluten. this study aims at evaluating the capacity of different bifidobacterium strains to counteract the inflammatory effects of gliadin-derived peptides in intestinal epithelial (caco-2) cells. a commercial extract of several gliadin (gld) types (alpha, beta, gamma, [symbol: see text] )  was subjected to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion (pepsin at ph 3, pancreatin-bile at ph 6), inoculated or not with cell suspensions (10(8) colony forming units/ml) of either b. animalis iata-a2, b. longum iata-es1, or b. bifidum iata-es2, in a bicameral system. the generated gliadin-derived peptides were identified by reverse phase-hplc-esi-ms/ms. caco-2 cell cultures were exposed to the different gliadin peptide digestions (0.25 mg protein/ml), and the mrna expression of nuclear factor kappa-b (nf-kappab), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and chemokine cxcr3 receptor were analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) in stimulated cells. the production of the pro-inflammatory markers nf-kappab p50, tnf-alpha, and il-1beta (interleukine 1beta) by caco-2 cells was also determined  by elisa. the peptides from gliadin digestions inoculated with bifidobacteria did not exhibit the toxic amino acid sequences identified in those noninoculated (alpha/beta-gld [158-164] and alpha/beta-gld [122-141]). the rt-pcr analysis evidenced a down-regulation in mrna expression of pro-inflammatory biomarkers. consistent with these results the production of nf-kappab, tnf-alpha, and il-1beta was reduced (18.2-22.4%, 28.0-64.8%, and abolished, respectively) in cell cultures exposed to gliadin digestions inoculated with bifidobacteria. therefore, bifidobacteria change the gliadin-derived peptide pattern and, thereby, attenuate their pro-inflammatory effects on caco-2 cells.

AB  == cd is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine that presents in genetically predisposed individuals following gluten consumption. in this study,  the effects of bifidobacterium (bifidobacterium bifidum iata-es2 and bifidobacterium longum atcc15707) and gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis dsm2451, escherichia coli cbl2, and shigella cbd8 isolated from cd patients), alone and in the presence of cd triggers (gliadins and/or ifn-gamma) on surface marker expression and cytokine production by pbmcs, were determined. these effects were also evaluated in cocultures of pbmcs and caco-2 cells. the gram-negative bacteria induced higher secretion of th1-type proinflammatory cytokines (il-12 and/or ifn-gamma) than the bifidobacterium strains. shigella cbd8 and e. coli cbl2 up-regulated mainly hla-dr and cd40 expression involved in  th1 activation, and bifidobacterium strains up-regulated cd83 expression. specific interactions among the studied bacteria, gliadins, and ifn-gamma, which  favored the cd immune features, were also detected. therefore, intestinal bacteria could be additional factors that regulate the ability of monocytes recruited to the mucosa to respond to gliadins and ifn-gamma in cd patients, influencing the course of the disease.

AB  == human milk contains approximately 200 complex oligosaccharides believed to stimulate the growth and establishment of a protective microbiota in the infant gut. the lack of scalable analytical techniques has hindered the measurement of bacterial metabolism of these and other complex prebiotic oligosaccharides. an in vitro, multi-strain, assay capable of measuring kinetics of bacterial growth and  detailed oligosaccharide consumption analysis by fticr-ms was developed and tested simultaneously on 12 bifidobacterial strains. for quantitative consumption, deuterated and reduced human milk oligosaccharide (hmo) standards were used. a custom software suite developed in house called glycolyzer was used  to process the large amounts of oligosaccharide mass spectra automatically with (13)c corrections based on de-isotoping protocols. high growth on hmos was characteristic of bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis strains, which consumed  nearly all available substrates, while other bifidobacterial strains tested, b. longum bv. longum, b. adolescentis, b. breve and b. bifidum, showed low or only moderate growth ability. total oligosaccharide consumption ranged from a high of  87% for b. infantis jcm 7009 to only 12% for b. adolescentis atcc 15703. a detailed analysis of consumption glycoprofiles indicated strain-specific capabilities towards differential metabolism of milk oligosaccharides. this method overcomes previous limitations in the quantitative, multi-strain analysis  of bacterial metabolism of hmos and represents a novel approach towards understanding bacterial consumption of complex prebiotic oligosaccharides.

TI  == interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the international obesity task force bmi criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr before and after the intervention. a group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant bmi (p=0.030) and bmi z-score (p=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. no significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. in the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased bacteroides fragilis group (p=0.001) and lactobacillus group (p=0.030) counts, and to decreased clostridium coccoides group (p=0.028), bifidobacterium longum (p=0.031), and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p=0.044) counts. in the high weight-loss group, b. fragilis group and lactobacillus group counts also increased (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively), whereas c. coccoides group and b. longum counts decreased (p=0.001 and p=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. total bacteria, b. fragilis group and clostridium leptum group, and bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts  were significantly higher (p<0.001-0.036) while levels of c. coccoides group, lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  bifidum were significantly lower (p<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. these findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be  influenced by the individual's microbiota.

TI  == effect of various encapsulating materials on the stability of probiotic bacteria.
AB  == ten probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-04, b. lactis type bi-07, howaru l. rhamnosus, and howaru b. bifidum, were encapsulated in various coating materials, namely alginate, guar gum, xanthan gum, locust bean gum, and carrageenan gum. the various encapsulated probiotic bacteria were studied for their acid and bile tolerance. free probiotic organisms were used as a control. the acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested at ph 2 over a 2-h incubation period. bile tolerance was tested with taurocholic acid over an 8-h incubation period. the permeability of the capsules was also examined using a water-soluble dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6-cf). the permeability  was monitored by measuring the amount of 6-cf released from the capsules during a 2-w storage period. results indicated that probiotic bacteria encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum survived better (p < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria, under acidic conditions. when free probiotic bacteria were exposed to taurocholic acid, viability was reduced by 6.36 log cfu/ml, whereas only 3.63, 3.27, and 4.12 log cfu/ml was lost in probiotic organisms encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum, respectively. all encapsulating materials tested released small amounts of 6-cf; however, alginate and xanthan gum retained 22.1% and 18.6% more fluorescent dye than guar gum. in general, microcapsules made of alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum greatly improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions and bile salts.

TI  == probiotics modulate the bifidobacterium microbiota of elderly nursing home residents.
AB  == gut bifidobacterium microbiota of the elderly has been suggested to differ from that of adults, possibly promoting the risk of infections and gut barrier dysfunction. specific probiotics may improve the gut barrier. in this randomized, placebo-controlled intervention study, 66 elders consumed a fermented oat drink containing probiotic bifidobacterium longum 46 and b. longum 2c or a non-fermented placebo oat drink for 6 months. faecal samples were collected before, during and after the intervention. levels of faecal bifidobacteria were determined using species-specific quantitative pcr and plate counting. the bifidobacterium levels in the elderly were high and the species composition diverse. probiotic intervention increased the levels bifidobacteria significantly. specifically, the levels of b. catenulatum, b. bifidum and b. breve were enhanced. consumption of the fermented oat drink itself was also associated with certain changes in microbiota. in conclusion, bifidobacterium microbiota of elderly subjects may be modulated by probiotic administration. in some healthy elderly populations, bifidobacterium microbiota may be more abundant and diverse than previously suggested.

TI  == hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension as a time- and cost-effective approach for quantitative determination of bifidobacterium spp. in infant feces.
AB  == the bifidobacterium spp. present in 10 infant fecal samples (4 from infants with  eczema and 6 from healthy infants) were quantified with both hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension (hope) and fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry. the relative abundances of bifidobacterium longum and b. catenulatum with respect to the total bifidobacteria had a poor correlation (rho, <0.600; p value, >0.208), presumably due to differences in primer specificity and the level of hybridization stringency of both methods. in  contrast, the relative abundances of organisms of the genus bifidobacterium against the total amplified 16s rrna genes and those of b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, and b. breve against the genus bifidobacterium exhibited a good statistical correlation (rho, >0.783; p value, <0.066). this good comparability supports hope as a method to achieve high-throughput quantitative determination of bacterial targets in a time- and cost-effective manner.

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

TI  == a bifidobacterium mixed-species microarray for high resolution discrimination between intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == a genomic dna-based microarray was constructed containing over 6000 randomly cloned genomic fragments of approximately 1-2 kb from six mammalian intestinal bifidobacterium spp. including b. adolescentis, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. catenulatum, b. longum and b. pseudolongum. this bifidobacterium mixed-species (bms) microarray was used to differentiate between type strains and isolates belonging to a set of nine bifidobacterium spp. hierarchical clustering of genomic hybridization data confirmed the grouping of the bifidobacterium spp. according to the 16s rrna-based phylogenetic clusters. in addition, these genomic hybridization experiments revealed high homology between the type-strain b. animalis subsp. lactis lmg18314 and b. animalis subsp. animalis lmg10508 (79%) as well as between the type strains b. longum biotype longum lmg13197 and b. longum  biotype infantis lmg8811 (72%) - nevertheless, discrimination between these species was possible due to the high resolution output of the bms-array. in addition, it was shown that the bms-array could be used for assigning unknown bifidobacterium isolates to a species group. finally, a set of 54 diagnostic clones for bifidobacterium identification was selected and sequenced to advance the understanding of the species-related differences. remarkably, a large fraction (31%) of these was predicted to encode proteins that belong to the bifidobacterial glycobiome and another 11% had functional homology with genes involved in the protection against foreign dna. overall, the bms-microarray is a  high-resolution diagnostic tool that is able to facilitate the detection of strain- and species-specific characteristics of bifidobacteria.

TI  == isolation of bifidobacteria from breast milk and assessment of the bifidobacterial population by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == the objective of this work was to elucidate if breast milk contains bifidobacteria and whether they can be transmitted to the infant gut through breastfeeding. twenty-three women and their respective infants provided samples of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 4 to 7 after birth. gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates from specific media with typical bifidobacterial shapes were identified to the genus level by f6ppk (fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase) assays and to the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bifidobacterial communities in breast milk were assessed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), and their levels were estimated by quantitative real-time pcr (qrti-pcr). bifidobacteria were present in 8 milk samples and 21 fecal samples. bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum were isolated from milk samples, while infant feces also contained b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of one to four dominant bifidobacterial bands in 22 milk samples. sequences with similarities above 98% were identified as bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. dentium. bifidobacterial dna was detected by qrti-pcr in the same 22 milk samples at a range between 40 and 10,000 16s rrna gene copies per ml. in conclusion, human milk seems to be a source of living bifidobacteria for the infant gut.

TI  == bifidobacterium strains suppress in vitro the pro-inflammatory milieu triggered by the large intestinal microbiota of coeliac patients.
AB  == background: coeliac disease (cd) is an enteropathy characterized by an aberrant immune response to cereal-gluten proteins. although gluten peptides and microorganisms activate similar pro-inflammatory pathways, the role the intestinal microbiota may play in this disorder is unknown. the purpose of this study was to assess whether the faecal microbiota of coeliac patients could contribute to the pro-inflammatory milieu characteristic of cd and the possible benefits of bifidobacteria. methods: the effect of faeces of 26 cd patients with  active disease (mean age 5.5 years, range 2.1-12.0 years), 18 symptom-free coeliac disease (sfcd) patients (mean age 5.5 years, range 1.0-12.3 years) on a gluten-free diet for 1-2 years; and 20 healthy children (mean age 5.3 years, range 1.8-10.8 years) on induction of cytokine production and surface antigen expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were determined. the possible regulatory roles of bifidobacterium longum es1 and b. bifidum es2 co-incubated with faecal samples were also assessed in vitro. results: faeces of  both active cd and sfcd patients, representing an imbalanced microbiota, significantly increased tnf-alpha production and cd86 expression in pbmcs, while  decreased il-10 cytokine production and cd4 expression compared with control samples. active cd-patient samples also induced significantly higher ifn-gamma production compared with controls. however, bifidobacterium strains suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern induced by the large intestinal content of  cd patients and increased il-10 production. cytokine effects induced by faecal microbiota seemed to be mediated by the nfkappab pathway. conclusion: the intestinal microbiota of cd patients could contribute to the th1 pro-inflammatory milieu characteristic of the disease, while b. longum es1 and b. bifidum es2 could reverse these deleterious effects. these findings hold future perspectives  of interest in cd therapy.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna on th1/th2-cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy and allergic  subjects.
AB  == among the factors potentially involved in the increased prevalence of allergic diseases, modification of the intestinal flora or lack of microbial exposure during childhood has been proposed. t(h)2-cytokines increase the production of ige and stimulate mast cells and eosinophils, whereas t(h)1-cytokines, such as ifn-gamma, may suppress ige synthesis and stimulate the expression of the secretory piece of iga. thus, a dysregulation in the expression of t(h)1- and t(h)2-cytokines may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of allergic diseases. lactobacilli belonging to the natural intestinal microflora were reported to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis and the severity of allergic manifestations and to modulate t(h)1/t(h)2 responses. the mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. we sought to assess the effect of different probiotics, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus gasseri (pa16/8), bifidobacterium bifidum (mp20/5), and bifidobacterium longum (sp07/3), on the t(h)1 and t(h)2 responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy subjects and from patients with allergy against house dust mite to staphylococcus enterotoxin a (sea) and dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (dpt). to elucidate the molecular basis of these effects, the effects of bacterial genomic  dna were compared with the effects of viable bacteria. pbmcs from allergic patients and from healthy donors were incubated for 24 or 48 h, respectively, with or without sea and dpt allergens. the effects of preincubation with live probiotic bacteria and the effect of their genomic dna, added simultaneously to cultures and incubated for 24h, were assessed by measuring t(h)1/t(h)2-cytokine production. the tested live gram-positive probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna inhibited sea- and dpt-stimulated secretion of t(h)2-cytokines (il-4 and il-5) and enhanced the stimulation of ifn-gamma. this effect was dose-dependent with a dosage-optimum, which was identical for all lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) tested (10 bacteria per pbmc) and their dna (75 ng/ml). based on the maximal effects achieved with lab and their dna, more than 50% of the effects seem to be contributed by dna. no significant effect was induced by the control,  gram-negative escherichia coli tg1. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria reduced sea-stimulated il-4 and il-5 production more effectively in pbmcs from healthy subjects than from allergic patients. in contrast to this, inhibition of dpt-stimulated il-4- and il-5-secretion was more pronounced in cells from allergic subjects. compared with living lab, bacterial dna inhibited il-4- and il-5-secretion in a similar manner. sea- and even more so dpt-stimulated ifn-gamma stimulation by living lab was less pronounced in allergic than in healthy subjects, whereas ifn-gamma stimulation by their dna was more pronounced  in allergic subjects. the tested probiotic bacteria as well as their genomic dna  modulated the t(h)1/t(h)2 response to some allergens dose-dependently. dna seems  to contribute to 50% of the effect exerted by living bacteria in this in vitro model. the magnitude of the probiotic effects differed between healthy and allergic subjects. whether the modulation found for the tested strains might be useful for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases has to be assessed in clinical trials.

TI  == examination of bovine lactoferrin binding to bifidobacteria.
AB  == in the present study, lactoferrin binding to bifidobacteria and detection of lactoferrin-binding protein in membrane fractions of several bifidobacteria have  been demonstrated. this is the first report showing the binding of bovine lactoferrin to four bifidobacterium spp. (b. infantis, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum) incubated with biotinylated lactoferrin and fluorescein conjugated-avidin and observed under an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope. fluorescence staining showed lactoferrin binding at the pole of the bacterial cells. a lactoferrin-binding protein with a molecular weight of approximately 67 kda was also detected in the membrane fraction of bifidobacterium spp. by far western blotting technique using biotinylated lactoferrin and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. based on the results of this and previously reported studies, we suggest that binding of lactoferrin to bifidobacterium longum is strain-dependent.

TI  == probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB  == probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (fao/who joint group). their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., bacillus clausii, lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri rc-14, gg, and l. plantarum 299v), bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), saccharomyces boulardii etc. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. these are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. critical illness and its  treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. however, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, icu stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost  effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. more information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. at present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.

AB  == a total of 142 human and 88 calf bifidobacteria were isolated and identified; approximately 12 % of all isolated strains exhibited auto-aggregation (agg) phenotype (agg+). properties considered to be predicting for their adhesion to intestine, i.e. auto-aggregation, and hydrophobicity were determined by xylene extraction in 18 human and 8 calf origin bifidobacteria. co-aggregation of 8 human bifidobacteria with 8 clostridia was also evaluated. agg varied between 16.3 and 96.4 %, hydrophobicity values ranged from 0 to 82.8 %. the strongest agg and hydrophobicity were observed in b. bifidum and b. merycicum isolates. however, there were no statistically significant correlations between these two properties. variability in the percentage of agg and hydrophobicity was observed  after cultivation of bifidobacteria on different carbon sources. all bifidobacteria showed co-aggregation ability with clostridia tested but there were remarkable differences depending on specific combinations of strains. the bifidobacterial strains with the highest ability to co-aggregate with clostridia  were b. bifidum i4 and b. longum i10 isolated from infants; these strains gave also high values of agg. agg properties together with co-aggregation ability with potential pathogen can be used for preliminary selection of probiotic bacteria.

AB  == twenty-eight exclusively breast-fed healthy infants and 16 infants also exclusively breast-fed with allergic colitis (aged 85 +/- 60 and 98 +/- 58 d, respectively) were screened for differences in fecal flora. bifidobacteria were detected in 23 healthy infants and only in 4 fecal samples of infants with allergic colitis. all bifidobacteria-free infants possessed gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. these bacteria were identified as clostridia using genus-specific fish probe. infants with allergy colitis possessed significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria and total anaerobes and significantly higher counts of clostridia in their feces. in healthy infants, bifidobacterium longum was the most frequently found species (54.5% of the samples), followed by b. adolescentis (20.0), b. breve (18.2), b. bifidum (16.4), b. dentium (10.9) and b. pseudocatenulatum (1.80). bifidobacterial isolates from  two babies with allergic colitis were identified as b. longum, one child from patients group contained species b. dentium and one baby b. adolescentis. our results suggest that there are significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria in infants with allergic colitis than in healthy infants.

AB  == a survey of infant fecal bifidobacterium isolates for plasmid dna revealed that a significant portion of the strains, 17.6%, carry small plasmids. the majority of  plasmid-harboring strains belonged to the bifidobacterium longum/infantis group.  most of the plasmids could be assigned into two groups based on their sizes and the restriction profiles. three plasmids, pb44 (3.6 kb) from b. longum, pb80 (4.9 kb) from bifidobacterium bifidum, and pb21a (5.2kb) from bifidobacterium breve were sequenced. while the former two plasmids were found to be highly similar to  previously characterized rolling-circle replicating pkj36 and pkj56, respectively, the third plasmid, pb21a, does not share significant nucleotide homology with known plasmids. however, it might be placed into the pcibb1-like group of bifidobacterial rolling-plasmids based on the homology of its rep protein and the overall molecular organization. two sets of escherichia coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vectors constructed based on pb44 and pb80 replicons were capable of transforming b. bifidum and b. breve strains with efficiency up to 3x10(4)cfu/microg dna. additionally, an attempt was made to employ a broad host range conjugation element, rp4, in developing of e. coli-bifidobacterium gene transfer system.

TI  == effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of bifidobacterium adolescentis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. the bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time pcr in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. the prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low g+c % gram-positive species faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, p=0.019). the composition of the genus bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. between three and five bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. real-time pcr was employed to quantify the four most prevalent bifidobacterium spp., b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum and b. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. b. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (p=0.001). b. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (p<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.

AB  == bifidobacteria and bacteroides-like bacteria are strictly anaerobic nonpathogenic members of human intestinal microflora. here we describe an analysis of the species and subspecies composition of these bacterial populations in healthy children using a combination of culture and molecular methods at two different time points. it was found that b. bifidum and b. longum are the most common dominant taxons in infants aged between 8 and 16 months. the majority of the infants carried several dominant bifidobacterium strains belonging to different species. examination of the dominant bifidoflora in some of these children after  a 5-year period showed major shifts in both species and strain composition, but the dominant strains remained unchanged in two children. the majority of dominant bacteroides-like isolates belonged to species b. vulgatus and b. uniformis, but members of genera alistipes and barnesiella were common too. in addition, a novel approach to species identification of bacteroidales order bacteria using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) is described.

TI  == gnotobiotic mouse immune response induced by bifidobacterium sp. strains isolated from infants.
AB  == bifidobacterium, which is a dominant genus in infants' fecal flora and can be used as a probiotic, has shown beneficial effects in various pathologies, including allergic diseases, but its role in immunity has so far been little known. numerous studies have shown the crucial role of the initial intestinal colonization in the development of the intestinal immune system, and bifidobacteria could play a major role in this process. for a better understanding of the effect of bifidobacterium on the immune system, we aimed at  determining the impact of bifidobacterium on the t-helper 1 (t(h)1)/t(h)2 balance by using gnotobiotic mice. germfree mice were inoculated with bifidobacterium longum ncc2705, whose genome is sequenced, and with nine bifidobacterium strains  isolated from infants' fecal flora. five days after inoculation, mice were killed. transforming growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1), interleukin-4 (il-4), il-10, and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) gene expressions in the ileum and ifn-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, il-4, and il-5 secretions by splenocytes cultivated for 48 h with concanavalin a were quantified. two bifidobacterium species had no effect (b. adolescentis) or little effect (b. breve) on the immune system. bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  dentium, and one b. longum strain induced t(h)1 and t(h)2 cytokines at the systemic and intestinal levels. one b. longum strain induced a t(h)2 orientation  with high levels of il-4 and il-10, both secreted by splenocytes, and of tgf-beta gene expression in the ileum. the other two strains induced t(h)1 orientations with high levels of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha splenocyte secretions. bifidobacterium's capacity to stimulate immunity is species specific, but its influence on the orientation of the immune system is strain specific.

TI  == rapid identification of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in probiotic products using multiplex pcr.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract and reinforce immunity in human health. recently, many functional products using the  lactic acid bacteria have been developed. among these lab, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium bifidum are frequently used for probiotic products. in order to monitor these lab in commercial probiotic products, a multiplex pcr method was developed. we designed four species-specific primer pairs for multiplex pcr from the 16s rrna,  16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region, and 23s rrna genes in lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium bifidum. using these primer pairs, 4 different lab were detected with high specificity in functional foods. we suggest that the multiplex pcr method developed in this study would be an efficient tool for simple, rapid, and reliable identification of lab used as probiotic strains.

TI  == bifidobacteria in feces and environmental waters.
AB  == bifidobacteria have been recommended as potential indicators of human fecal pollution in surface waters even though very little is known about their presence in nonhuman fecal sources. the objective of this research was to shed light on the occurrence and molecular diversity of this fecal indicator group in different animals and environmental waters. genus- and species-specific 16s rrna gene pcr assays were used to study the presence of bifidobacteria among 269 fecal dna extracts from 32 different animals. twelve samples from three wastewater treatment plants and 34 water samples from two fecally impacted watersheds were also tested. the species-specific assays showed that bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. dentium, and b. catenulatum had the broadest host distribution (11.9 to 17.4%), whereas b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were detected in fewer than 3% of all fecal samples. phylogenetic analysis of 356 bifidobacterial clones obtained from different animal feces showed that ca. 67% of all of the sequences clustered with cultured bifidobacteria, while the rest formed a supercluster with low sequence identity (i.e., <94%) to previously described bifidobacterium spp. the b. pseudolongum subcluster (>97% similarity) contained 53 fecal sequences from seven different animal hosts, suggesting the cosmopolitan distribution of members of this clade. in contrast, two clades containing b. thermophilum and b. boum clustered exclusively with 37 and 18 pig fecal clones, respectively, suggesting host specificity. using species-specific assays, bifidobacteria were detected in only two of the surface water dna extracts, although other fecal anaerobic bacteria were detected in these waters.  overall, the results suggest that the use of bifidobacterial species as potential markers to monitor human fecal pollution in natural waters may be questionable.

TI  == in vitro fermentability of human milk oligosaccharides by several strains of bifidobacteria.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the catabolism and fermentation of human  milk oligosaccharides (hmo) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. oligosaccharides were isolated from a pooled sample of human milk using solid-phase extraction, and then added to a growth medium as the sole source of fermentable carbohydrate. of five strains of bifidobacteria tested (bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum biovar longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium adolescentis), b. longum bv. infantis grew better, achieving triple the cell density then the other strains. b. bifidum did not reach a high cell density, yet generated free sialic acid, fucose and n-acetylglucosamine in the media, suggesting some capacity for hmo degradation. thin layer chromatography profiles of spent fermentation broth suggests substantial degradation of oligosaccharides by b. longum bv. infantis, moderate degradation by b. bifidum and little degradation by other strains. while all strains were able to individually ferment two monosaccharide constituents of hmo, glucose and galactose, only b. longum bv. infantis and b. breve were able to ferment glucosamine, fucose and sialic acid. these results suggest that as a potential prebiotic, hmo may selectively promote  the growth of certain bifidobacteria strains, and their catabolism may result in  free monosaccharides in the colonic lumen.

TI  == characterisation of glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (ec 2.6.1.16) and n-acetylglucosamine metabolism in bifidobacterium.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum, in contrast to other bifidobacterial species, is auxotrophic for n-acetylglucosamine. growth experiments revealed assimilation of  radiolabelled n-acetylglucosamine in bacterial cell walls and in acetate, an end-product of central metabolism via the bifidobacterial d: -fructose-6-phosphate shunt. while supplementation with fructose led to reduced n-acetylglucosamine assimilation via the d: -fructose-6-phosphate shunt, no significant difference was observed in levels of radiolabelled n-acetylglucosamine incorporated into cell walls. considering the central role played by glutamine fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (glms) in linking the biosynthetic pathway for n-acetylglucosamine to hexose metabolism, the glms of bifidobacterium was characterized. the genes encoding the putative glms of b. longum dsm20219 and b. bifidum dsm20082 were cloned and sequenced. bioinformatic  analyses of the predicted proteins revealed 43% amino acid identity with the escherichia coli glms, with conservation of key amino acids in the catalytic domain. the b. longum glms was over-produced as a histidine-tagged fusion protein. the purified c-terminal his-tagged glms possessed glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase activity as demonstrated by synthesis of glucosamine-6-phosphate from fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine. it also possesses an independent glutaminase activity, converting glutamine to glutamate  in the absence of fructose-6-phosphate. this is of interest considering the apparently reduced coding potential in bifidobacteria for enzymes associated with glutamine metabolism.

TI  == maternal breast-milk and intestinal bifidobacteria guide the compositional development of the bifidobacterium microbiota in infants at risk of allergic disease.
AB  == background: the sources and the impact of maternal bacteria on the initial inoculum of the intestinal microflora of newborn infants remain elusive. objective: to assess the association between maternal breast-milk and fecal bifidobacteria and infants' fecal bifidobacteria. methods: sixty-one mother-infant pairs were included, special emphasis being placed on the maternal  allergic status. bifidobacteria were analysed by a direct pcr method in fecal samples from mothers at 30-35 weeks of gestation and from infants at 1 month of age and from breast-milk samples 1 month post-partum. results: fecal bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium bifidum colonization frequencies and counts among mother-infant pairs correlated significantly (p=0.005 and 0.02 for frequencies, respectively, and p=0.002 and 0.01 for counts, respectively). only infants of allergic, atopic mothers were colonized with b. adolescentis. each of the breast-milk samples contained bifidobacteria [median 1.4 x 10(3) bacterial cells/ml; interquartile range (iqr) 48.7-3.8 x 10(3)]. bifidobacterium  longum was the most frequently detected species in breast-milk. allergic mothers  had significantly lower amounts of bifidobacteria in breast-milk compared with non-allergic mothers [median 1.3 x 10(3) bacterial cells/ml (iqr 22.4-3.0 x 10(3)) vs. 5.6 x 10(3) bacterial cells/ml (1.8 x 10(3)-1.8 x 10(4)), respectively, (p=0.004)], and their infants had concurrently lower counts of bifidobacteria in feces [3.9 x 10(8) bacterial cells/g (iqr 6.5 x 10(6)-1.5 x 10(9)) in infants of allergic mothers, vs. 2.5 x 10(9) bacterial cells/g (6.5 x 10(8)-3.2 x 10(10)) in infants of non-allergic mothers, p=0.013]. conclusions: breast-milk contains significant numbers of bifidobacteria and the maternal allergic status further deranges the counts of bifidobacteria in breast-milk. maternal fecal and breast-milk bifidobacterial counts impacted on the infants' fecal bifidobacterium levels. breast-milk bacteria should thus be considered an important source of bacteria in the establishment of infantile intestinal microbiota.

TI  == molecular cloning and comparative analysis of four beta-galactosidase genes from  bifidobacterium bifidum ncimb41171.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum ncimb41171 carries four genes encoding different beta-galactosidases. one of them, named bbgiii, consisted of an open reading frame of 1,935 amino acid (a.a.) residues encoding a protein with a multidomain structure, commonly identified on cell wall bound enzymes, having a signal peptide, a membrane anchor, fivar domains, immunoglobulin ig-like and discoidin-like domains. the other three genes, termed bbgi, bbgii and bbgiv, encoded proteins of 1,291, 689 and 1,052 a.a. residues, respectively, which were  most probably intracellularly located. two cases of protein evolution between strains of the same species were identified when the a.a. sequences of the bbgi and bbgiii were compared with homologous proteins from b. bifidum dsm20215. the homologous proteins were found to be differentiated at the c-terminal a.a. part either due to a single nucleotide insertion or to a whole dna sequence insertion, respectively. the bbgiv gene was located in a gene organisation surrounded by divergently transcribed genes putatively for sugar transport (galactoside-symporter) and gene regulation (laci-transcriptional regulator), a structure that was found to be highly conserved in b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, suggesting optimal organisation shared amongst those species.

TI  == the role of a probiotics mixture in the treatment of childhood constipation: a pilot study.
AB  == background: inconsistent data exist about the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of constipation. several studies in adults with constipation showed positive effects of probiotics on constipation. inconsistent data exist regarding the effect of a single probiotic strain in constipated children. the aim of this  pilot study was to determine the effect of a mixture of probiotics containing bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the treatment of childhood constipation. methods: children aged 4-16 years with constipation as defined by the rome iii criteria were eligible for the study. during a 4 week period, children received a daily mix of 4 x 109 colony forming units of a probiotic mixture (ecologic(r)relief) containing bifidobacteria (b.) bifidum, b. infantis, b. longum, lactobacilli (l.) casei, l. plantarum and l. rhamnosus. primary outcome measures were frequency of bowel movements (bms) per week and stool consistency.  secondary outcome measures were number of faecal incontinence episodes per week,  abdominal pain and side effects. results: twenty children, 50% male, median age 8 (range 4-16) were included. the frequency of bms per week increased from 2.0 (1.0-5.0) to 4.2 (0.0-16.0) in week 2 (p = 0.10) and 3.8 (2.1-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.13). in 12 children presenting with <3 bms/week, bms per week increased significantly from 1.0 (0.0-2.0) to 3.0 (0.0-7.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 3.0 (0.0-10.0) in week 4 (p = 0.01). the stool consistency was reported as hard in 7  children at baseline, in 4 children at week 2 (p = 0.23) and in 6 children after  4 weeks of treatment (p = 1.00). a significant decrease in number of faecal incontinence episodes per week was found in the entire group: 4.0 (0.0-35.0) to 1.5 (0.0-14.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 0.3 (0.0-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.001). the  presence of abdominal pain decreased significantly from 45% to 25% in week 2 (p = 0.04) and 20% at week 4 (p = 0.006). no side effects were reported. conclusion: this pilot study shows that a mixture of probiotics, has positive effects on symptoms of constipation. to confirm these findings, a large randomised placebo controlled trial is required.

TI  == qualitative and quantitative analyses of the bifidobacterial microbiota in the colonic mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer, diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == aim: to characterize the bifidobacterial microbiota of the colonic mucosa in patients with colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticuitis. methods: a sample of the distal colonic mucosa was taken during surgery from a total of 34 patients, twenty-one with diagnosed colorectal cancer, nine with diverticulitis and four with inflammatory bowel disease, requiring surgery for their condition.  bacterial dna was extracted from the resected mucosal samples and bifidobacterial mucosa-associated microbiota was qualitatively and quantitatively determined by means of qualitative and quantitative pcr. results: bifidobacteria were found in  100% of the samples from patients with diverticulitis or ibd and a 76% of those suffering colon cancer. the species b. longum and b. bifidum were the most widely found, followed by b. animalis, b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis. b. breve, b.  dentium and b. angulatum were not detected in any sample. a significantly higher  occurrence of b. longum was observed in patients with diverticulitis than in those with colon cancer or ibd (100%, 62% and 75%, respectively, p < 0.05). similar results were obtained for b. animalis (56%, 0% and 25%, p < 0.05), while  b. adolescentis was only found in the mucosa from patients with colon cancer (5 out of 21, 24%). at the quantitative level, patients with colon cancer or ibd showed lower counts of total bifidobacterium (4.94 and 5.91 vs 6.96 log cells/sample, respectively, p < 0.05) and of the species b. longum (4.05 and 4.79 vs 6.76, p < 0.05) than those with diverticulitis. conclusion: aberrancies in mucosa associated microbiota are present in different intestinal diseases. this may indicate a role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

TI  == breast milk: a source of bifidobacteria for infant gut development and maturation?
AB  == background: the establishment of gut microbiota is a stepwise process contributing to gut development and maturation of the immune system. aberrant gut microbiota at an early age may predispose to disease later in life. breast-fed infants harbor a characteristic intestinal microbiota dominated by bifidobacteria. objectives: to assess, using molecular techniques (pcr), whether  human milk contains bifidobacteria and to determine the bifidobacterial species present. methods: the presence of bifidobacteria in breast milk samples (n = 20)  was qualitatively and quantitatively determined by using pcr and real-time pcr, respectively. results: breast milk samples contained bifidobacteria. bifidobacterium longum was the most widely found species followed by bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. conclusion: breast milk contains bifidobacteria and specific bifidobacterium species that may promote healthy microbiota development.

TI  == binding of human plasminogen to bifidobacterium.
AB  == bifidobacteria constitute up to 3% of the total microbiota and represent one of the most important health-promoting bacterial groups of the human intestinal microflora. the presence of bifidobacterium in the human gastrointestinal tract has been directly related to several health-promoting activities; however, to date, no information about the specific mechanisms of interaction with the host is available. in order to provide some insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction with the host, we investigated whether bifidobacterium was able to capture human plasminogen on the cell surface. by using flow cytometry, we demonstrated a dose-dependent human plasminogen-binding  activity for four strains belonging to three bifidobacterial species: bifidobacterium lactis, b. bifidum, and b. longum. the binding of human plasminogen to bifidobacterium was dependent on lysine residues of surface protein receptors. by using a proteomic approach, we identified five putative plasminogen-binding proteins in the cell wall fraction of the model strain b. lactis bi07. the data suggest that plasminogen binding to b. lactis is due to the concerted action of a number of proteins located on the bacterial cell surface, some of which are highly conserved cytoplasmic proteins which have other essential cellular functions. our findings represent a step forward in understanding the mechanisms involved in the bifidobacterium-host interaction.

TI  == myo-inositol hexakisphosphate degradation by bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697.
AB  == the ability of five strains of different bifidobacterial species (bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. longum, b. pseudolongum) isolated from human and animal gut to degrade myo-inositol hexaphosphate or phytic acid (insp(6)) has been evaluated. the disappearance of phytate and the generation of  lower myo-inositol phosphates were determined in a complex medium in which phytic acid was the only source of phosphorus. bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697 showed the highest level of phytate-degrading activity. this strain displayed optimal activity at slight acid ph (6.0-6.5) and 50 degrees c, but also retained  high activity levels at neutral ph and 37 degrees c. b. infantis atcc 15697 produced maximum activity during the stationary phase of growth and when 1% lactose was used as carbon source. in contrast, the presence of inorganic phosphate in the growth medium inhibited phytase activity. the ability of b. infantis atcc 15697 to generate lower myo-inositol phosphates and, particularly,  accumulate myo-inositol tri-phosphates (insp(3)) from partial hydrolysis of insp(6) could contribute to the reduction of the anti-nutritional properties of insp(6) and the generation of intermediate compounds with beneficial properties during food processing and gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == evaluation of enhanced hygroscopicity, bifidogenicity, and anticariogenicity of enzymatically synthesized beta-galactosyl-trehalose oligosaccharides.
AB  == beta-galactosyl-trehalose oligosaccharides (beta-gtos) were enzymatically prepared as a mixture of 6-beta-galactosyl-trehalose (1) and 4-beta-galactosyl-trehalose (2) with a 9:1 ratio (w/w). the beta-gto mixture showed a highly enhanced hygroscopicity as compared to those of trehalose and other sugars used. at 72 h of incubation under 90% relative humidity and room temperature, it had a large increase in weight due to its moisture absorption, which was five times larger than that of trehalose, 1.9 times larger than that of sucrose, and 1.5 times larger than that of maltotriose. it was very effective in  the growth promotion of bifidobacteria, such as bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium bifidum, which was better than the growth promotion in the cases  of trehalose and galactooligosaccharide. it also showed a highly anticariogenic property; it had only 10% cell proliferation of streptococcus sobrinus for that of the sucrose control and 60% inhibition of insoluble glucan synthesis. its effectiveness of inhibition was two and 1.5 times better than that of trehalose and one and two times than xylitol, respectively, against cell growth and glucan  synthesis. conclusively, the functionality of the beta-gto in terms of hygroscopicity, bifidogenicity, and anticariogenicity was considerably improved as compared to that of trehalose. it is thus suggested that the beta-gto might be applied as an effective humectant and prebiotic substitute with enhanced noncariogenicity in food applications.

AB  == the basic characteristics of the spore-forming lactic acid bacterium, sporolactobacillus inulinus bcrc 14647, was evaluated in vitro for its potential  probiotic properties. assessments including acid and bile salt tolerance, adhesiveness, and antagonistic effects on pathogenic salmonella enteritidis bcrc  10744, as well as inhibition factors of spent culture supernatant (scs) and an invasion assay, were conducted using lactobacillus acidophilus bcrc 10695 and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium bifidum bcrc 14615 and b. longum bcrc 11847) as a reference. in the results, s. inulinus spores presented significantly higher survival rates than the vegetative cell form in acidic conditions as well as the  reference bifidobacteria. however, l. acidophilus showed the highest viability among all tested strains. similar results were found in the bile tolerance test.  compared with the reference strains, the vegetative cell form of s. inulinus possessed a proper adhesive characteristic (71.7 bacteria/field for s. inulinus and 91.3 and 45.7 bacteria/field for b. bifidum and b. longum, respectively). in  the adhesion assay, both the spore form of s. inulinus (17.1 bacteria/field) and  the negative control, l. bulgaricus bcrc 14009 (5.9 bacteria/field), displayed nonadhesive traits. the vegetative cells of s. inulinus and its scs both dramatically decrease the adhesion of s. enteritidis to caco-2 cells; meanwhile,  the scs of s. inulinus vegetative cells inhibited the growth of s. enteritidis in the inhibition zone test. the existing inhibition factor could be assumed to be lactic acid in the scs. from the results of the invasion assay, s. inulinus showed high safety properties. in conclusion, based on these in vitro evaluations, results suggest that s. inulinus presents probiotic features of great potential in the vegetative cell form.

TI  == sugar transport systems of bifidobacterium longum ncc2705.
AB  == here we present the complement of the carbohydrate uptake systems of the strictly anaerobic probiotic bifidobacterium longum ncc2705. the genome analysis of this bacterium predicts that it has 19 permeases for the uptake of diverse carbohydrates. the majority belongs to the atp-binding cassette transporter family with 13 systems identified. among them are permeases for lactose, maltose, raffinose, and fructooligosaccharides, a commonly used prebiotic additive. we found genes that encode a complete phosphotransferase system (pts) and genes for  three permeases of the major facilitator superfamily. these systems could serve for the import of glucose, galactose, lactose, and sucrose. growth analysis of ncc2705 cells combined with biochemical characterization and microarray data showed that the predicted substrates are consumed and that the corresponding transport and catabolic genes are expressed. biochemical analysis of the pts, in  which proteins are central in regulation of carbon metabolism in many bacteria, revealed that b. longum has a glucose-specific pts, while two other species (bifidobacterium lactis and bifidobacterium bifidum) have a fructose-6-phosphate-forming fructose-pts instead. it became obvious that most carbohydrate systems are closely related to those from other actinomycetes, with  a few exceptions. we hope that this report on b. longum carbohydrate transporter  systems will serve as a guide for further in-depth analyses on the nutritional lifestyle of this beneficial bacterium.

TI  == inhibitory impact of bifidobacteria on the transfer of beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae in the gnotobiotic mouse digestive tract.
AB  == while looking for new means to limit the dissemination of antibiotic resistance,  we evaluated the role of potentially probiotic bifidobacteria on the transfer of  resistance genes between enterobacteria. transfers of bla genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (shv-5 and ctx-m-15) were studied in the absence or presence of bifidobacteria. in vitro, transfer frequencies of these bla genes decreased significantly in the presence of three of five tested strains, i.e., bifidobacterium longum cuetm-89-215, bifidobacterium bifidum cip-56.7t, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum cip-104168t. four transfer experiments were conducted in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice, the first  three observing the effect of b. longum cuetm-89-215, b. bifidum cip-56.7t, and b. pseudocatenulatum cip-104168t on blashv-5 transfer and the fourth experiment studying the effect of b. bifidum cip-56.7t on blactx-m-15 transfer. these experiments revealed significant decreases in the transconjugant levels (up to 3  logs) in mice having received b. bifidum cip-56.7t or b. pseudocatenulatum cip-104168t compared to control mice. bifidobacteria appear to have an inhibitory impact on the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. the inhibitory effect is associated to specific bifidobacterial strains and may be related to the production of thermostable metabolites by these strains.

TI  == population dynamics of bifidobacterium species in human feces during raffinose administration monitored by fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry.
AB  == the population dynamics of bifidobacteria in human feces during raffinose administration were investigated at the species level by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) coupled with flow cytometry (fcm) analysis. although double-staining fish-fcm using both fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc) and indodicarbocyanine (cy5) as labeling dyes for fecal samples has been reported, the analysis was interfered with by strong autofluorescence at the fitc fluorescence region because of the presence of autofluorescence particles/debris  in the fecal samples. we circumvented this problem by using only cy5 fluorescent  dye in the fish-fcm analysis. thirteen subjects received 2 g of raffinose twice a day for 4 weeks. fecal samples were collected, and the bifidobacterial populations were monitored using the established fish-fcm method. the results showed an increase in bifidobacteria from about 12.5% of total bacteria in the prefeeding period to about 28.7 and 37.2% after the 2-week and 4-week feeding periods, respectively. bifidobacterium adolescentis, the bifidobacterium catenulatum group, and bifidobacterium longum were the major species, in that order, at the prefeeding period, and these bacteria were found to increase nearly in parallel during the raffinose administration. during the feeding periods, indigenous bifidobacterial populations became more diverse, such that minor species in human adults, such as bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bifidobacterium dentium, and bifidobacterium angulatum, proliferated. four weeks  after raffinose administration was stopped, the proportion of each major bifidobacterial species, as well as that of total bifidobacteria, returned to approximately the original values for the prefeeding period, whereas that of each minor species appeared to differ considerably from its original value. to the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first clear demonstration of the population dynamics of indigenous bifidobacteria at the species level in response to raffinose administration.

TI  == determination of survival, identity and stress resistance of probiotic bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts.
AB  == aims: to determine the level of bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts in the uk, identify the species, and compare the resistance of common bifidobacterium spp. to acidity and oxidative stress. methods and results: a storage trial of bio-yoghurts was carried out to determine the level and survival of bifidobacteria. the 16s rrna gene targeted pcr was used to identify the species.  acid tolerance was determined by introducing the organisms to ph-adjusted skimmed milk and enumerating during storage at 4 degrees c. oxidative stress resistance was determined using the h(2)o(2) disc diffusion assay technique. nine of 10 bio-yoghurts contained bifidobacteria at levels >10(6) cfu g(-1) at the time of purchase. the viability of the organism decreased during storage and on expiry only five products retained viability >10(6) cfu g(-1) while two others were very close to the target population. bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis showed superior survival abilities and stress tolerance compared with bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum biotype infantis. conclusions: bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, the only bifidobacterium spp. found in bio-yoghurts, had the greatest resistance to acidity and oxidative stress. significance and impact of the study: the technological properties of b. animalis ssp. lactis make it suitable for inclusion in bio-yoghurts although its putative  health benefits need further investigation.

TI  == characterization of human intestinal bifidobacteria using competitive pcr and pcr-ttge.
AB  == in this study, a competitive pcr was developed to estimate the quantity of bifidobacteria in human faecal samples using two 16s rrna gene bifidobacterium genus-specific primers, bif164f and bif662r. a pcr-temporal temperature gradient  gel electrophoresis (ttge) with the same primers also allowed us to describe the  bifidobacterium species present in these faecal samples. the pcr product obtained from the competitor had 467 bp, and was 47 bp shorter than the pcr products obtained from bifidobacterium strains. the number of bifidobacterial cells was linear from 10 to 10(8) cells per pcr assay. taking into account the dilutions of the extracted dna, the linear range was over 8 x 10(5) bifidobacteria g(-1) of faeces. reproducibility was assessed from 10 independent dna extractions from the same stool and the coefficient of variation was 0.5%. when the competitive pcr was compared with the culture method, a similar count of seven out of nine bifidobacterium pure cultures were obtained, or had a difference inferior or equal to 1 log(10). in faecal samples, the enumeration of bifidobacterium genus in most cases gave higher results with competitive pcr than with culture on selective columbia-beerens agar ph 5 (p < 0.05). in conclusion, this competitive  pcr allows a rapid, highly specific and reproducible quantification of bifidobacterium genus in faecal samples. ttge fragments co-migrating with b. longum cip64.63 fragment were found in 10 out of 11 faecal samples. bifidobacterium adolescentis and b. bifidum were detected in five out of 11 subjects. thus, cpcr and pcr-ttge can be associated in order to characterize human faecal bifidobacteria.

TI  == [isolation and comparative analysis of glycolipid fractions in bifidobacteria].
AB  == a comparative tlc analysis of lipid extracts from bifidobacterium longum b 379 m, b. bifidum 791, and b. adolescentis 94 bim has been performed. it is demonstrated that carbohydrate-containing lipid components were present in the bacteria, which differed in their chromatographic mobility (rf) from similar compounds isolated from actinomycetes stomatococcus mucilaginosus pcm 2415t, nocardiopsis dassonvillei pcm 2492, propionibacterium propionicum pcm 2431, saccharopolyspora  hirsuta pcm 2279 (= atcc 27875t), rhodococcus equi pcmt 559 (= atcc 3969), and gordonia bronchialis pcm 2167. polar lipids of bifidobacteria exhibited the closest similarity to their counterparts from propionic acid bacteria. preparative chromatography (silica gel column i; elution with chloroform, acetone, and methanol) of the lipid extract of b. adolescentis 94 bim made it possible to isolate fractions containing nonpolar lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids. further purification of the glycolipid fraction (column ii; eluant, methanol gradient in chloroform) produced preparations of glycolipids and phospholipids. the preparations were studied by two-dimensional tlc using solvent systems chloroform-methanol-h2o mili q (65 : 25 : 4, v/v/v) and n-butanol-acetic  acid-h2o mili q (60 : 20 : 20, v/v/v) for directions i and ii, respectively. two  major glycolipids were revealed (g1 and g2), in addition to compounds characteristic of the polar lipid group and minor glycolipids (g), the latter being present in considerably lesser amounts.

TI  == [analysis of bifidobacteria spp. composition in human gut via temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge)].
AB  == temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge) method combined with 16s rdna clone library profiling was used to analyze bifidobacteria spp. composition in human gut in this study. bifidobacteria group-specific tgge patterns of 10 healthy human individuals showed that the bifidobacteria population in humans was host-specific. the genomic diversity and species composition of bifidobacteria in different individual was dissimilar. through sequencing and tgge comigration analysis of the bifidobacteria group-specific amplicons for one healthy boy, it was revealed that the tgge bands of this individual represented species bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis, b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. pseudocatenulatum and one potentially new species, respectively. b. pseudocatenulatum was the most common species of tested samples. while as control, only two species- b. pseudocatenulatum and b. longum were isolated using traditional culture method. bifidobacteria group-specific pcr based tgge method combined with 16s rdna clone library profiling is a sensitive and effective approach to resolve the population structure of bifidobacteria in microflora of human intestinal tract.

TI  == conditions affecting cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == the cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria have been characterized for 30 strains isolated from a fecal sample. strain identification  to the species level was obtained by restriction analysis of the amplified 16s rrna gene and confirmed by dna/dna reassociation experiments. the isolates were grouped in four genetically homogeneous clusters whose members belonged to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum species. cell surface properties of bifidobacterium strains were evaluated by determining the level of hydrophobicity, adhesion to hydrocarbons and contact angle measurements, and their autoaggregation ability. the results showed high and homogeneous level of hydrophobicity in all tested strains when contact angle measurements values were  considered. on the contrary, autoaggregation assays and bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons detected interesting differences in cell surface properties among the tested bifidobacterium strains. the highest levels of autoaggregation, detected in b. bifidum and b. adolescentis strains, were strictly dependent on the ph of the medium. moreover, protease treatment experiments suggested that proteins had a key role in the autoaggregating ability of b. bifidum and b. adolescentis strains.

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == novel bifidobacterial glycosidases acting on sugar chains of mucin glycoproteins.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum was found to produce a specific 1,2-alpha-l-fucosidase. its gene (afc a) has been cloned and the dna sequence was determined. the afc a protein consisting of 1959 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 205 kda can be divided into three domains; the n-terminal function-unknown domain (576 aa), the catalytic domain (898 aa), and the c-terminal bacterial ig-like domain (485 aa). the recombinant catalytic domain specifically hydrolyzed the terminal alpha-(1-->2)-fucosidic linkages of various oligosaccharides and sugar chains of glycoproteins. the primary structure of the catalytic domain exhibited  no similarity to those of any glycoside hydrolases but showed similarity to those of several hypothetical proteins in a database, which resulted in establishment of a novel glycoside hydrolase family (gh family 95). several bifidobacteria were found to produce a specific endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase, which is the endoglycosidase liberating the o-glycosidically linked galactosyl beta1-->3 n-acetylgalactosamine disaccharide from mucin glycoprotein. the molecular cloning of endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase was carried out on bifidobacterium longum based on the information in the database. the gene was found to comprise 1966 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 210 kda. the recombinant protein released galactosyl beta1-->3 n-acetylgalactosamine disaccharide from natural glycoproteins. this enzyme of b. longum is believed to be involved in the catabolism of oligosaccharide of intestinal mucin glycoproteins. both 1,2-alpha-l-fucosidase and endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase are novel and specific enzymes acting on oligosaccharides that exist mainly in mucin glycoproteins. thus, it is reasonable to conclude that bifidobacteria produce these enzymes to preferentially utilize the oligosaccharides present in the intestinal ecosystem.

TI  == production and characterization of anti-bifidobacteria monoclonal antibodies and  their application in the development of an immuno-culture detection method.
AB  == an immuno-culture method has been developed by combination of specific monoclonal antibodies and plate culture to allow detection of viable bifidobacteria. cell wall proteins were selected as surface antigen to produce antibodies against bifidobacteria. the cell wall proteins were extracted and purified from six atcc  strains of bifidobacteria grown in mrs broth using an anaerobic system. to compare the profile of the protein extracts, all the protein solutions obtained were analyzed by sds-page. similar bands corresponding to the major proteins of each species of bifidobacteria were observed. the proteins were tested for their  immunogenicity in balb/c mice after immunization and subsequent analysis using elisa procedures. high immune responses were generated in mice immunized by proteins from bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium longum. monoclonal antibodies were produced against b. longum and tested for their specificity, sensitivity and cross reactivity with other bifidobacteria species. all the hybridoma cells selected produced anti-b. longum antibodies cross-reacting with native and purified proteins from five other bifidobacteria species. an epitope supported by a cross-reacting protein of 58 kda shared by bifidobacteria was revealed by western blot. this was confirmed by immune-transmission electron microscopy observations which showed the specific interaction of these antibodies with bifidobacterial cell wall proteins. also, the antibody obtained was found to be specific for the genus bifidobacterium and sensitive, allowing the detection of at least 10(5) target cells/ml. an immuno-culture detection approach was then  developed using the selected anti-b. longum antibodies. this method was shown to  be very efficient for the detection of viable cells of bifidobacteria suggesting  the possibility of its use to quantify these bacteria in various food matrices.

TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == study of adhesion and survival of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria on table olives with the aim of formulating a new probiotic food.
AB  == with the aim of developing new functional foods, a traditional product, the table olive, was used as a vehicle for incorporating probiotic bacterial species. survival on table olives of lactobacillus rhamnosus (three strains), lactobacillus paracasei (two strains), bifidobacterium bifidum (one strain), and  bifidobacterium longum (one strain) at room temperature was investigated. the results obtained using a selected olive sample demonstrated that bifidobacteria and one strain of l. rhamnosus (lactobacillus gg) showed a good survival rate, with a recovery of about 10(6) cfu g(-1) after 30 days. the lactobacillus gg population remained unvaried until the end of the experiment, while a slight decline (to about 10(5) cfu g(-1)) was observed for bifidobacteria. high viability, with more than 10(7) cfu g(-1), was observed throughout the 3-month experiment for l. paracasei impc2.1. this strain, selected for its potential probiotic characteristics and for its lengthy survival on olives, was used to validate table olives as a carrier for transporting bacterial cells into the human gastrointestinal tract. l. paracasei impc2.1 was recovered from fecal samples in four out of five volunteers fed 10 to 15 olives per day carrying about 10(9) to 10(10) viable cells for 10 days.

AB  == a total of 58 probiotic products obtained worldwide, which were claimed to contain bifidobacterium strains (including 22 yoghurts, 5 dairy fruit drinks, 28  food supplements and 3 pharmaceutical preparations) were investigated in parallel using a culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach. three isolation media previously reported as selective for bifidobacterium were evaluated for their suitability in the quality analysis of these products. subsequently, possible bifidobacterial colonies were picked from the best medium and identified by means of rep-pcr fingerprinting using the box primer (box-pcr). bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, formerly classified as bifidobacterium lactis, was most frequently found, but strains belonging to bifidobacterium longum biotypes longum and infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium  breve were recovered also. in parallel, all products were also subjected to culture-independent analysis which involved a nested-pcr step on total bacterial  dna extracted directly from the product, followed by separation of the amplicons  by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and subsequent identification of species from the band patterns. by conventional cultivation, 70.7% of the products analysed were found to contain culturable bifidobacteria whereas by culture-independent dgge analysis members of the genus bifidobacterium could be detected in 96.5% of the analysed products. genotypic characterization of a number of bifidobacterial isolates at the strain level by means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) revealed a relatively high degree of genomic homogeneity among the bifidobacterium strains currently used in the probiotic industry.

TI  == novel putative galactose operon involving lacto-n-biose phosphorylase in bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == a lacto-n-biose phosphorylase (lnbp) was purified from the cell extract of bifidobacterium bifidum. its n-terminal and internal amino acid sequences were homologous with those of the hypothetical protein of bifidobacterium longum ncc2705 encoded by the bl1641 gene. the homologous gene of the type strain b. longum jcm1217, lnpa, was expressed in escherichia coli to confirm that it encoded lnbp. no significant identity was found with any proteins with known function, indicating that lnbp should be classified in a new family. the lnpa gene is located in a novel putative operon for galactose metabolism that does not contain a galactokinase gene. the operon seems to be involved in intestinal colonization by bifidobacteria mediated by metabolism of mucin sugars. in addition, it may also resolve the question of the nature of the bifidus factor in human milk as the lacto-n-biose structure found in milk oligosaccharides.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr assays to identify and quantify fecal bifidobacterium  species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == a healthy intestinal microbiota is considered to be important for priming of the  infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. breast-fed infants typically have an intestinal microbiota dominated by different bifidobacterium species. it has been described that allergic infants have different levels of specific bifidobacterium species than healthy infants. for the accurate quantification of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium angulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum in fecal samples, duplex 5' nuclease assays  were developed. the assays, targeting rrna gene intergenic spacer regions, were validated and compared with conventional pcr and fluorescent in situ hybridization methods. the 5' nuclease assays were subsequently used to determine the relative amounts of different bifidobacterium species in fecal samples from infants receiving a standard formula or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides (osf). a breast-fed group was studied in parallel as a reference. the results showed a significant increase in the total amount of fecal bifidobacteria (54.8% +/- 9.8% to 73.4% +/- 4.0%) in infants receiving the prebiotic formula (osf), with a diversity of bifidobacterium species similar to breast-fed infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants who received a standard formula seems to resemble a more adult-like distribution of bifidobacteria and contains relatively more b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis (2.71% +/- 1.92% and 8.11% +/- 4.12%, respectively, versus 0.15% +/- 0.11% and 1.38% +/- 0.98% for the osf group). in conclusion, the specific prebiotic infant  formula used induces a fecal microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of  breast-fed infants also at the level of the different bifidobacterium species.

TI  == variation of microbiological and biochemical parameters in the faeces of two healthy people over a 15 day period.
AB  == background: recent years have seen increasing interest in the complex microbial ecosystem of the human gastrointestinal tract. knowledge of its microbial colonists and their beneficial/detrimental activities is important. however, generalized assumptions about the microbial composition of the human gut should be taken with caution until more studies in different human communities have been conducted. the capacity of modulating or inhibiting harmful populations through high doses of beneficial microorganisms (probiotics) is now an attractive possibility. aims: the aim of this study was to determine the daily variation in  the most prominent and representative of the cultivable microbial populations in  the faeces of two healthy spanish persons, with special reference to the lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria). faecal enzymatic activities caused or modulated by gut microorganisms were also examined. methods: microbial  populations were enumerated in selective and differential media. lab species isolated from mrs agar plates were further identified by phenotypic and genetic techniques. enzymatic activities were measured by the semi quantitative method of the api zym system. results: obligate anaerobes (members of the clostridium clusters and species of bacteroides and bifidobacteria) made up the largest bacterial populations in both individuals (ranging between 10(10)-10(11) cfu/g of faeces) and remained constant over time. lactobacilli species were found at an intermediate level (around 10(8) cfu/g), and yeasts and moulds, staphylococci, enterococci, coliforms and enterobacteriaceae at a lower level (between 10(3) to  10(6) cfu/g). 38 lactic acid bacteria strains identified belonged to bifidobacterium bifidum [19], bifidobacterium longum [7], bifidobacterium adolescentis [7] and lactobacillus ruminis [5] species. enzymatic profiles and values were shown to be personal and stable, but inter-sample fluctuations were recorded. conclusions: the dominant microbial populations in the faeces of the two persons were similar and stable during the sampling period. large differences were found in the lactic acid bacterial composition of each individual. biochemistry seemed to be also personal and stable over time.

AB  == biochemical characterization of the purified bile salt hydrolase (bsh) from bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 11863 revealed some distinct characteristics not observed in other species of bifidobacterium. the bsh gene was cloned from b. bifidum, and the dna flanking the bsh gene was sequenced. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned gene with previously known sequences revealed high homology with bsh enzymes from several microorganisms and penicillin v amidase (pva) of bacillus sphaericus. the proposed active sites of pva were highly conserved, including that of the cys-1 residue. the importance of the sh group in the n-terminal cysteine was confirmed by substitution of cys with chemically and structurally similar residues, ser or thr, both of which resulted  in an inactive enzyme. the transcriptional start point of the bsh gene has been determined by primer extension analysis. unlike bifidobacterium longum bsh, b. bifidum bsh was transcribed as a monocistronic unit, which was confirmed by northern blot analysis. pcr amplification with the type-specific primer set revealed the high level of sequence homology in their bsh genes within the species of b. bifidum.

AB  == aims: the aim of the present study was to compare several molecular methods for the identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria, and further to investigate genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of bifidobacterial isolates from  intestinal samples of finnish adult subjects. methods and results: a total of 153 intestinal bifidobacterial isolates were included in initial screening and 34 isolates were further characterized. identification results obtained with pcr-elisa and ribotyping were well in accordance with each other, while randomly  amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) gave tentative identification only to bifidobacterium bifidum and to 65% of the b. longum isolates. the most commonly detected species were b. longum biotype longum followed by b. adolescentis and b. bifidum. in addition, b. animalis (lactis), b. angulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum were found. ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) proved to be discriminatory methods for bifidobacteria, but also rapd revealed intraspecies heterogeneity. besides two b. animalis (lactis) isolates with very close similarity to a commercially available probiotic strain, none of the intestinal isolates showed optimal survival in all tolerance (acid, bile and oxygen) or growth performance tests. conclusions: several species/strains of bifidobacteria  simultaneously colonize the gastrointestinal tract of healthy finnish adults and  intestinal bifidobacterium isolates were genetically heterogeneous. functional properties of bifidobacteria were strain-dependent. significance and impact of the study: applicability of ribotyping with the automated riboprinter system for  identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria was shown in the present study.

AB  == the gut microbiota may be important in the postnatal development of the immune system and hence may influence the prevalence of atopic diseases. bifidobacteria  are the most numerous bacteria in the guts of infants, and the presence or absence of certain species could be important in determining the geographic incidence of atopic diseases. we compared the fecal populations of bifidobacteria from children aged 25 to 35 days in ghana (which has a low prevalence of atopy),  new zealand, and the united kingdom (high-prevalence countries). natal origin influenced the detection of bifidobacterial species in that fecal samples from ghana almost all contained bifidobacterium infantis whereas those of the other children did not. choosing species on the basis of our bacteriological results, we tested bifidobacterial preparations for their effects on cell surface markers  and cytokine production by dendritic cells harvested from cord blood. species-specific effects on the expression of the dendritic-cell activation marker cd83 and the production of interleukin-10 (il-10) were observed. whereas cd83 expression was increased and il-10 production was induced by bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, b. infantis failed to produce these effects. we concluded that b. infantis does not  trigger the activation of dendritic cells to the degree necessary to initiate an  immune response but that b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. pseudocatenulatum induce a th2-driven immune response. a hypothesis is presented to link our observations to the prevalence of atopic diseases in different countries.

TI  == enumeration, isolation, and identification of bifidobacteria from infant feces.
AB  == thirty-three fully breast-fed infants aged between 1 and 12 weeks were screened for bifidobacteria in feces. bifidobacteria counts in most fecal samples determined both by tpy agar and fish procedure ranged from 10(8) to 10(11) cfu/g. three infants did not contain any bifidobacteria in their fecal samples. one child was delivered by caesarean section and the other two by normal vaginal delivery. all bifidobacteria-free infants possessed gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. these bacteria were identified as clostridia  using genus-specific fish probe. in bifidobacteria-positive samples, b. longum (57.9% of the samples) was the most frequently found species, followed by b. adolescentis (31.6%), b. bifidum (21.0%), b. breve (10.5%), b. pseudocatenulatum  (5.3%), and b. dentium (5.3%).

TI  == growth-promoting effects of lactoferrin on l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium spp.
AB  == we investigated the effects of lactoferrin on the growth of l. acidophilus ch-2,  bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700, b. longum atcc 15707, b. infantis atcc 15697, and b. bifidum atcc 15696. the growth of l. acidophilus was stimulated by bovine  holo-lactoferrin but not by apo-lactoferrin. with bifidobacteria, bovine lactoferrin stimulated growth of three strains: b. breve, b. infantis and b. bifidum under certain conditions. both apoprotein and holoprotein had similar effects. however, b. longum growth was not affected by lactoferrin. thus, the mechanism of stimulating growth of bifidobacteria may be different from that of l. acidophilus. by far-western blotting using biotinylated lactoferrin and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, lactoferrin-binding proteins were detected in the membrane protein fraction of l. acidophilus, b. bifidum, b. infantis and b. breve. the molecular weights of lactoferrin-binding proteins of l. acidophilus were estimated from sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 27, 41 and 67 kda, and those of the three bifidobacterial strains were estimated  to be 67-69 kda. however, no such lactoferrin-binding components were detected in the membrane fraction of b. longum. it is interesting that the appearance of lactoferrin-binding proteins in the membrane fraction of these species corresponds to their growth stimulation by lactoferrin.

TI  == genus- and species-specific pcr primers for the detection and identification of bifidobacteria.
AB  == 16srdna-targeted genus- and species-specific pcr primers have been developed and  used for the identification and detection of bifidobacteria. these primers cover  all of the described species that inhabit the human gut, or occur in dairy products. identification of cultured bifidobacteria using pcr primer pairs is rapid and accurate, being based on nucleic acid sequences. detection of bifidobacteria can be achieved using dna extracted from human faeces as template  in pcr reactions. we have found that, in adult faeces, the bifidobacterium catenulatum group was the most commonly detected species, followed by bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium bifidum. in breastfed infants, bifidobacterium breve was the most frequently detected species, followed by bifidobacterium infantis, b. longum and b. bifidum. it was notable that the b. catenulatum group was detected with the highest frequency in adults, although it has often been reported that b. adolescentis is  the most common species. real-time, quantitative pcr using primers targeting 16s  rdna shows promise in the enumeration of bifidobacteria in faecal samples. the approach to detect the target bacteria with quantitative pcr described in this review will contribute to future studies of the composition and dynamics of the intestinal microflora.

TI  == [evaluation of the activity of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt].
AB  == the effect of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. a yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture yc 180 (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture aby-1 (bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b, infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). it was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees c until ph reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees c for 21 days. during fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing ph and  lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. it was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (aby-1 and yc 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of l. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. the presence of bifidobacteria in the aby-1 culture did not present a significant effect over l. monocytogenes. neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over l. monocytogenes (p = 0.448).  in this case, the aby-1 and yc 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over  the pathogen. the probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over l. monocytogenes. this is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.

TI  == multiplex pcr using 16s rrna gene-targeted primers for the identification of bifidobacteria from human origin.
AB  == three multiplex polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) targeted on bifidobacterium and related species were designed to identify human species. the selected primers yielded amplified products of various sizes, each specific for a species. three to four pairs were gathered in one pcr reaction and their specificity under multiplex conditions was confirmed using dna from 26 reference strains. using this technique on unidentified faecal strains, b. bifidum, b. longum and b. breve species were commonly recovered in infants while b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum/b. pseudocatenulatum continuum and b. longum species were predominant in adults. thus, a single pcr can provide the assignment of a strain to one these species, reducing the number of pcr reactions and hands-on time for the identification of human isolates of bifidobacteria. moreover, this technique is also applicable for the in situ detection of bifidobacteria in dna extracts from  human stools.

TI  == species specific identification of nine human bifidobacterium spp. in feces.
AB  == based on the 16s rdna sequences, species specific primers were designed for the rapid identification by dna amplification of nine human bifidobacterium spp., namely b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. infantis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum. b. lactis currently included in dairy products was added to the series. the primers were designed to  target different positions of the 16s rdna, allowing the simultaneous identification of these ten species of bifidobacterium using two mixtures of primers. the identification procedure described in this paper was validated by establishing a correlation with an alui restriction pattern of the different full length amplified 16s rdna. this multiple primer dna amplification technique was applied for the identification of pure colonies of bifidobacterium spp. or directly from total bacteria recovered from human fecal samples. the technique was shown to be useful to detect dominant species and, when primers were used in  separate reactions, underrepresented species could be identified as well.

TI  == stimulation of the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == to characterize the ability of bifidobacteria to affect the production of macrophage-derived cytokines, a murine macrophage-like cell line, j774.1, was cultured in the presence of 27 strains of heat-inactivated bifidobacteria. bifidobacterium adolescentis and b. longum, known as adult-type bifidobacteria, induced significantly more pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, il-12 and tnf-alpha, by j774.1 cells, than did the infant-type bifidobacteria, b. bifidum,  b. breve, and b. infantis (p<0.01). in contrast, b. adolescentis did not stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory il-10 from j774.1 cells as the other tested bacteria did. the results suggest that the adult-type bifidobacteria, especially b. adolescentis, may be more potent to amplify but less able to down-regulate the inflammatory response.

TI  == pcr-elisa ii: analysis of bifidobacterium populations in human faecal samples from a consumption trial with bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and a galacto-oligosaccharide preparation.
AB  == a pcr-elisa method was extended for detection of most common bifidobacterium species in humans and applied to a feeding trial including administration of bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and galacto-oligosaccharide (gos)-containing syrup as probiotic and prebiotic preparations, respectively. for pcr-elisa, oligonucleotide probes based on 16s rdna sequences were designed and tested for specificity and sensitivity with nine different bifidobacterial species followed  by analysis of faecal samples. bifidobacteria were monitored for their fluctuations during and after the feeding trial. bifidobacterium longum was the most common species found in the faecal samples, followed by b. adolescentis and  b. bifidum. during ingestion of the probiotic b. lactis bb-12, the strain appeared in the faeces but was absent again one week after finishing of the trial. the species that were observed in the faecal samples taken prior to the feeding experiments persisted also in samples derived from the pre-feeding and feeding periods. the most consistent change observed was the decrease in the relative amount of b. longum in the test group ingesting either b. lactis bb-12 alone or in combination with gos-syrup. since the amounts of b. longum increased  again in the post-feeding sample with these subjects, it may suggest that to some extent b. lactis bb-12 is able to transiently replace b. longum.

TI  == production of oligosaccharides in yogurt containing bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures.
AB  == yogurts were prepared by using yogurt cultures combined to mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum) and  by adding a preincubation step (1.5 h at 50 degrees c) with bifidobacteria to the conventional method of manufacture in order to produce oligosaccharides. the survival of bifidobacteria was drastically affected during storage of yogurts, except for products containing b. animalis, in which viable counts remained at >10(6) cfu/g after 28 d of storage at 4 degrees c. oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 were produced during the preincubation step (0.31 to 0.68%), and the amount in the final products varied according to the species of bifidobacteria inoculated during the preincubation step or the concentration of bifidobacteria used as second inoculum during the fermentation process. in fact,  the higher concentration of oligosaccharides measured at the end of the fermentation process (0.72%) and the 28 d-storage period (0.67%) was obtained for yogurts containing b. infantis. however, yogurts containing b. breve showed higher beta-galactosidase activities and had lower lactose concentrations after the fermentation process and the storage period than the other yogurts. the use of a mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (b. animalis, b. infantis, or b. breve) thus allows the production of yogurts in which bifidobacteria can survive in relatively high cell numbers and contain appreciable amount of oligosaccharides.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

(bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == simultaneous identification of five bifidobacterium species isolated from human beings using multiple pcr primers.
AB  == on the basis of 16s rrna sequences, 5 species-specific forward primers were designed for the identification of 5 bifidobacterium species isolated from human  intestine, namely b. bifidum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, b. breve and b. longum. as the 5 primers targeted at different sites of 16s rdna, by using their  mixture and a genus-specific reversed primer, the 5 bifidobacterium species can be simultaneously identified in individual or in mixed culture through pcr amplification. the specificity of the primers was confirmed by the use of genomic dnas from type strains of all 32 bifidobacterium species and 6 other relatives. the 5-primer mixture was also applied to the identification of bifidobacterium strains used commercially. the results turned out to be in accordance with those  from conventional identification. this multiple-primer method provides a useful tool for rapid identification of the 5 bifidobacterium species indicated.

TI  == viability of probiotic (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in argentinian fresco cheese.
AB  == we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms,  yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had  a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == the efficient enzymatic synthesis of n-acetyllactosamine in an organic co-solvent.
AB  == in the presence of beta-galactosidase from bifidobacterium bifidum, n-acetyllactosamine was synthesized in significantly enhanced yield compared with earlier routes. different proportions of the (1-->4)- and (1-->6)-linked forms were obtained depending on the choice of enzyme and reaction conditions, viz. the nature of added organic co-solvent (20-80% of 2-ethoxy ethyl ether, trimethyl phosphate, or acetone). the beta-(1-->4)-linked disaccharide was the major product and the beta-(1-->6)-linked disaccharide was the minor product. with beta-galactosidases from p. multicolor, a. oryzae, b. longum the beta-(1-->6) linkage was exclusively synthesized. procedures for optimising the yield of n-acetyllactosamine are discussed. an immobilized enzyme on a nylon powder column was used for the efficient recycling of enzyme and synthesizing the disaccharide.

TI  == cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
AB  == the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.

TI  == [the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
AB  == the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b.  longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and  b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of coptis japonica (makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (bs), berberine iodide (bi), palmatine chloride (pc), and palmatine sulfate(ps)], as well as that of thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (egcg). the biologically active constituents of the coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (bc), palmatine iodide (pi), and coptisine chloride (cc) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. in a test using 500 microg/disk, bc and pi produced a clear inhibitory effect against bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli. at 1000 microg/ disk, cc revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas egcg exhibited weak growth inhibition against only c. perfringens and c. paraputrificum. among various isoquinoline alkaloids, bc exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward c. perfringens than bi and bs, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in pi compared to pc and ps. the coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of b. longum and c. perfringens.

TI  == distribution of bifidobacterial species in human intestinal microflora examined with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers.
AB  == in order to clarify the distribution of bifidobacterial species in the human intestinal tract, a 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific pcr technique was developed and used with dnas extracted from fecal samples obtained from 48 healthy adults and 27 breast-fed infants. to cover all of the bifidobacterial species that have been isolated from and identified in the human intestinal tract, species-specific primers for bifidobacterium longum, b. infantis, b. dentium, and b. gallicum were developed and used with primers for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, and the b. catenulatum group (b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum) that were developed in a previous study (t. matsuki, k. watanabe, r. tanaka, and h. oyaizu, fems microbiol. lett. 167:113-121, 1998). the specificity of the nine primers was confirmed by pcr, and the species-specific pcr method was found to be a useful means for identifying bifidobacterium strains isolated from human feces. the results of an examination  of bifidobacterial species distribution showed that the b. catenulatum group was  the most commonly found taxon (detected in 44 of 48 samples [92%]), followed by b. longum and b. adolescentis, in the adult intestinal bifidobacterial flora and  that b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were frequently found in the intestinal tracts of infants. the present study demonstrated that qualitative detection of the bifidobacterial species present in human feces can be accomplished rapidly and accurately.

TI  == molecular monitoring of human intestinal bifidobacterium strain diversity.
AB  == predominant bifidobacterium strains belonging to the intestinal flora of four human volunteers were isolated on selective medium before and after eight days of treatment with oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (augmentin). these antimicrobial  agents are known to be strongly active against the genus bifidobacterium. a fifth volunteer did not receive the antibiotics and was considered as a control. bifidobacteria were characterized by hybridizing a ribosomal 23s dna probe onto their ecorv restriction patterns, and were identified by comparing the ribosomal  patterns obtained to collection strains. a total of 17 distinct ribosomal patterns and 23 distinct pattern types were revealed for the 95 isolates tested.  each type characterized was correlated with a specific ribosomal pattern associated with a specific total restriction pattern. similar-sized molecular bands permitted isolates to be unambiguously discriminated into the species b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis. this study enabled us to show considerable strain variability among individuals. three months after penicillin  ingestion, no significant changes were observed in bifidobacterium flora. each flora remained relatively stable for strain composition over time, with some slight variations also detected in our control subject.

TI  == note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  == pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis and bif. bifidum), lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. the appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. of the selective media, amc, rms, npnl and bl-og performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lact. acidophilus. however, of these four media, amc was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. the amc agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.

TI  == characterization of bifidobacteria by random dna amplification.
AB  == rapd conditions were optimized to generate reproducible banding patterns by testing primers, thermocyclers and overall reproducibility in repeat dna analysis and separate dna extractions. five primers were chosen on the basis of band intensity and distribution (between 2 and 10 bands) which clearly distinguished among strains of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis and b. longum. the use of five single-primer reactions under optimized conditions improved the resolution and accuracy of the rapd method for  the characterization of dairy-related bifidobacteria. the results indicated that  this method was highly reproducible in repeated analysis. similarity between bifidobacteria strains was evaluated based on their rapd profiles. using a set of five primers, it was demonstrated that it may be possible to distinguish three different species of bifidobacterium (b. breve, b. bifidum and b. adolescentis),  based on similarity of the rapd profiles to known reference strains. furthermore, application of the rapd technique may also be useful and faster, than traditional systematics for placement of industrial strains into specific clusters (either b. longum/infantis or b. animalis/lactis).

TI  == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

TI  == influence of two infant formulas and human milk on the development of the faecal  flora in newborn infants.
AB  == the establishment of the faecal flora of 39 full-term infants fed exclusively on  breast milk (n = 20) or with two different modern adapted cow's milk formulas (n  = 19) was studied during the first 3 months of life. one formula investigated was based on 100% bovine casein as the protein source whereas the other formula contained bovine milk proteins with a whey/casein ratio of 60:40. a faecal flora  rich in bifidobacteria was found in all study groups; the growth of putrefactive  bacteria (especially bacteroides spp.), however, was limited. in formula-fed infants, significantly higher bacterial counts of enterococci and clostridia were detected compared to breast milk-fed infants. similarities and differences due to the feeding regimen were particularly reflected in the pattern of the anaerobic bacterial species. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis and b. breve constituted  the majority of the bifidobacterial flora independent of the type of milk feeding. other bifidobacterial species such as b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. parabifidum and b. pseudo-catenulatum were detected in high numbers and at low frequencies in breastfed infants. the latter three were observed in infants fed the whey/casein formula as well. it seems that infants fed a casein formula develop a faecal flora more like that of breastfed infants concerning lactobacillus spp. (especially l. fermentum and l. brevis).

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == characterization of dairy-related bifidobacterium spp. based on their beta-galactosidase electrophoretic patterns.
AB  == numerical analysis of phenotypic characteristics based on enzymatic activity and  carbohydrate fermentation allowed the discrimination of most strains of bifidobacteria of animal origin from those of human origin. strains of bifidobacteria studied were separated into nine groups based on numerical analysis. three groups contained most strains of animal origin, three groups comprised both strains of animal and human origin, and three groups were strictly composed of strains of human origin. the results indicate that one group of animal origin (group ii) contained all reference strains of bifidobacterium animals and 10 strains isolated from fermented milks or commercial preparations.  although numerical analysis of enzymatic activities and carbohydrate fermentation patterns allowed the differentiation of 'wild' strains of b. animalis and b. longum isolated from commercial preparations, this method failed to confirm the species. in the present study, the determination of electrophoretic patterns of beta-galactosidases resulted in the development of a new technique for the differentiation of bifidobacterium species. several isoenzymes of beta-galactosidase were detected among strains of bifidobacteria. each species had a specific electrophoretic pattern. the detection of beta-galactosidase by electrophoresis is a new tool for distinguishing between dairy- and non-dairy-related bifidobacteria. dairy-related bifidobacteria (b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis and b. longum) as well as b. animalis could be better differentiated from other bifidobacteria by comparison of their beta-galactosidase electrophoretic patterns, rather than by numerical analysis of their phenotypic characteristics.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of jejunal aspirates and faecal samples after oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of enterococcus faecium and bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of lactobacillus acidophilus, bif. bifidum, lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. however, the test preparation containing ent. faecium and bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (p = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (p < 0.02). this study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI  == growth characteristics of bifidobacteria in ultrafiltered milk.
AB  == five replicates of raw skim milk were ultrafiltered at 54 degrees c to total protein concentration ratios of 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1. bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium longum were inoculated at 5% into skim milk that was not ultrafiltered (1:1) and into ultrafiltered skim milks followed by incubation at 37 degrees c. the mean maximum bacterial count (colony-forming units per milliliter) range and protein concentration ratio were from 6.25 x 10(8) to 1.69  x 10(9), skim milk; 4.42 x 10(8) to 3.56 x 10(9), 2:1; 2.62 x 10(8) to 3.94 x 10(9), 3:1; 6.67 x 10(8) to 1.88 x 10(9), 4:1; and 2.90 x 10(9) to 3.59 x 10(9),  5:1. the mean developed acidity at maximum b. bifidum population in skim milk was .16%, and ph was 5.55. the 5:1 concentrate had a higher mean developed acidity of .57% at ph 5.35, which was similar to that of the skim milk. trends were similar  for b. longum. because of the increased buffering capacity of highly concentrated ultrafiltered milks, ph 5.5 or higher was maintained longer, along with high developed acidity. scanning electron micrographs showed distinct morphological variations between bifidobacteria grown in broth versus those grown in the milks.

TI  == species-specific oligonucleotide probes for five bifidobacterium species detected in human intestinal microflora.
AB  == portions of the 16s rrna from closely related species of the genus bifidobacterium that are found in the human intestinal microflora were sequenced  in order to design species-specific oligonucleotide probes. five oligonucleotide  probes ranging from 16 to 19 bases in length and complementary to 16s rrna sequences from bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were synthesized. with crude high-molecular-weight rna preparations as targets, these probes showed the desired species specificity, even down to a 1-nucleotide difference. for the practical evaluation of these probes, their specificity and sensitivity were tested against seven strains of the same species and 54 strains of heterologous bacteria with fixed whole cells as targets. the probes for b. adolescentis, b. breve, and b. longum showed efficient and specific hybridization. although the probes for b. bifidum and b. infantis cross-reacted with a few bacterial strains not isolated from humans, these probes showed species specificity for human intestinal bacteria. these 16s rrna probes should prove valuable for the identification and detection of human intestinal bifidobacterium species.

TI  == [the biological properties of bifidobacterium].
AB  == the possibility of the formation of exoenzymes, such as dnaase, rnaase and hemolysin, by bifidobacteria was studied in comparison with their acid-forming and adhesive activity. bifidobacterium reference strains, originally isolated from healthy adults and children, were studied. the study involved altogether 73  strains of bifidobacteria, including 24 b. bifidum strains, 13 b. adolescentis strains, 7 b. infantis strains, 10 b. breve strains and 19 b. longum strains. the bifidobacteria under study were shown to differ not only in the presence and activity of properties useful for macroorganisms, but also in the presence of enzymes having depolymerizing activity (dnaase, hemolysin). thus, out of 73 strains under study 9 proved to be dnaase-positive and 6, hemolysin positive. at  the same time a specific feature of bifidobacteria was their high acid-forming activity with the complete absence of rnaase activity and insignificant dnaase- and hemolysin-forming activity.

TI  == [the effect of phospholipids on the adhesive properties of bacteria].
AB  == the present work shows that choline-containing phospholipids (lysophosphatidylcholine and lyso-1-alkyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine) inhibit the adhesion of some strains: bacterium bifidum 1, b. adolescentis mc-42, b. longum b. 379m, staphylococcus aureus p 209 and klebsiella pneumoniae 52. phosphatidylcholine produces no effect on the adhesiveness of these strains, while platelet activation factor stimulates adhesiveness only in strain s. aureus 209. the stimulating or inhibiting action of phospholipids on the adhesive process of microorganisms depends on the species of bacteria and on the concentration of reagents.

TI  == comparison of carbohydrate substrate preferences in eight species of bifidobacteria.
AB  == eight species of bifidobacteria were tested for their abilities to grow on a range of monosaccharides (glucose, arabinose, xylose, galactose and mannose). in  contrast to the other sugars, glucose and galactose were utilized by all species  and, in general, specific growth rates were highest on these sugars. different substrate preferences were observed between species when the bacteria were grown  in the presence of all five monosaccharides. for example, glucose and xylose were coutilized by bifidobacterium longum, whereas glucose repressed uptake of all other sugars in b. bifidum and b. catenulatum. galactose was the preferred substrate with b. pseudolongum. in b. angulatum, glucose and galactose were utilized simultaneously. b. breve did not grow on arabinose when this sugar provided the sole source of energy. however, glucose and arabinose were preferentially taken up during growth on sugar mixtures.

TI  == growth promotion of bifidobacterium species by whey and casein fractions from human and bovine milk.
AB  == an in vitro assay was used to study the growth-promotional activity of human milk (hm), cow's milk (cm), and whey and casein fractions of hm and cm for five strains of bifidobacterium species isolated originally from stools of human infants. whey- and casein-predominant cm-based infant formulas were studied as well. when compared on an equivalent protein basis, the growth promotion activity of hm was greater than that of cm for bifidobacterium bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus and bifidobacterium longum but comparable for b. bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium breve. pasteurization of hm and cm  resulted in an increase of growth promotion activity for b. bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus and b. bifidum, a decrease for b. infantis, and no change for b. longum and b. breve. the growth promotion activity of hm whey was slightly higher than that of hm casein for four strains of bifidobacteria. when cm casein was a substrate, virtually no growth occurred for b. bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus, b. bifidum, b. infantis, and b. longum. the growth promotion activity of cm whey, however, was similar to that of hm whey. a similar trend was observed for cm-based infant formula. whey-dominant formulas promoted better growth of b. bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus, b. bifidum, and b. infantis than casein-dominant  formulas. the data suggest a direct relationship between amount of whey-specific  factors and the ability to promote growth of clinically relevant strains of bifidobacterium species by hm, cm, and cm-based infant formulas.

TI  == structure of macroamphiphiles from several bifidobacterium strains.
