TI  == nosocomial infections and microbiologic spectrum after major elective surgery of  the pancreas, liver, stomach, and esophagus.
AB  == background: the majority of infections treated by surgeons are nosocomial infections (ni). the frequency of these infections in relation to the organ operated on as well as the organisms involved are not well defined. detailed knowledge of these issues is essential for optimal care of surgical patients. this study aimed to determine infection rates and the responsible pathogens after major elective surgery of the pancreas, liver, stomach, and esophagus. methods: between january 1, 2005 and august 31, 2007, the records of all patients of the department of general, abdominal and vascular surgery, university hospital magdeburg (germany) with elective resection of the pancreas, liver, stomach, and  esophagus were evaluated retrospectively. study parameters were: patient number,  age, gender, body mass index (bmi), american society of anesthesiologists (asa) classification, indication for resection, operation duration, length of stay (los) in the intensive care unit (icu) and in hospital, mortality, organ-related  rate and kind of ni, and microbiologic spectrum. nosocomial infections were defined as: surgical site infection (u.s. centers for disease control and prevention [cdc] 1 or 2) and intra-abdominal infection (cdc 3), urinary tract infection, clinical sepsis, blood stream and catheter-related infection, respiratory tract infection, and pneumonia. results: a total of 358 patients were included: 150 (42%) with pancreas resection, 91 (25%) with liver resection, 105 (29%) with gastric resection, and 12 (3%) with esophagus resection. median los in the icu for all groups was 48.8 h (interquartile range [iqr] 24.9-91.8 h), median los in hospital was 16 d (iqr 13-23 d), and in-hospital mortality was 4.5%. patients with ni had significantly greater in-hospital death and prolonged stay in hospital and icu (p<0.001). in 120 (33.5%) patients, one or more ni occurred (range, 83% in esophagus patients to 21% in liver patients). intra-abdominal (16.5%) and surgical site infections (12.3%) were most frequent; 80.8% of the ni  were culture-positive. the most frequent clinically relevant isolates were escherichia coli (12.4%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (12.2%), and enterococcus faecium (9.7%). the highest resistance rates were found for staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] 29.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.5%). conclusions: for patients undergoing elective surgery of the pancreas, liver, stomach, and esophagus, considerable differences  in demographic factors, frequency, and kind of ni exist. the consequences of ni force surgeons to analyze pre-operative risk factors carefully, assess indications for operation thoroughly, and optimize all controllable parameters.

TI  == bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) against  the eskape pathogens.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. the 'eskape' pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) have been  highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. the stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. this study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed apntp jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the eskape pathogens. standard plate counts and the xtt metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of apntp, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. apntp exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the eskape pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and  complete eradication of eskape pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of a. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. this demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == repurposing non-antimicrobial drugs and clinical molecules to treat bacterial infections.
AB  == there is a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials to circumvent the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. the objective of this study is to identify non-antibiotic drugs with potent antimicrobial activity, within an applicable clinical range. a library, containing 727 fda approved drugs and small molecules, was screened against eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobactercloacae). drugs that showed antimicrobial activity in an applicable clinical range were further tested in vitro and in vivo in an infected mouse model. the initial screening identified 24 non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules active against gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) isolates. two non-antibiotic drugs showed activity against gram-negative pathogens. among the active non-antibiotic drugs, only ebselen (eb) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (fdurd), showed bactericidal activity, in an applicable  clinical range, against multi-drug-resistant staphylococcus isolates including mrsa, vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa), and vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa).the minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of clinical isolates of s. aureus were inhibited (mic90) was found to be 0.25 and 0.0039mg/l  for eb and fdurd, respectively. treatment with eb orally significantly increased  mice survival in a lethal model of septicemic mrsa-infection by (60%) compared to that of control. fdurd oral and intraperitoneal treatment significantly enhanced  mouse survival by 60% and 100%, respectively. these data encourage screening and  repurposing of non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

TI  == the risk factors for mortality and septic shock in liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia.
AB  == background/aims: although bacteremias due to the six eskape pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problems in solid organ transplant (sot), no information in liver transplant recipients is available. we sought to investigate the risk factors for mortality and septic shock in liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia. methodology: a retrospective analysis of bacteremia after liver transplantation was reviewed. risk factors for mortality and septic shock caused by eskape bacteremia were identified. results: forty-nine episodes ofbacteremia in 37 liver transplant recipients were due to eskape strains. the only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with eskape was septic shock (odds ratio [or] = 67.500, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 8.464-538.300, p < .001). the factors for septic shock independently associated with eskape were white blood cells count > 15,000/mm3 (or = 15.205, 95% ci = 2.271-101.799, p = .005) and temperature of 39 degrees c or greater (or = 10.959, 95% ci = 1.592-75.450, p = .015). conclusions: to improve the results of liver transplantation, more effectively therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia present with septic shock, elevated white blood cells count and high body temperature.

TI  == repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic):  0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.

TI  == spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  == ac-gf(a6c)g(a6c)k(a6c)g(a6c)f(a6c)g(a6c)gk(a6c)kkkk-amide (a6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (amp) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43mum. spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this  amp interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. cd and 2d-(1)h nmr experiments indicated this amp  on binding to sds and dpc micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages  of helical and random coil conformers. cd investigations in the presence of three phospholipid suvs consisting of popc, 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc revealed: (1) the interactions occurring with popc suvs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the amp yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

TI  == development of novel antibacterial drugs to combat multiple resistant organisms.
AB  == background: infections due to multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria are increasing both in hospitals and in the community and are characterized by high mortality rates. new molecules are in development to face the need of active compounds toward resistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. in particular, the infectious diseases society of america (idsa) has supported the initiative to develop ten new antibacterials within 2020. principal targets are the so-called eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae). purpose: to review the characteristics and the status of development of new antimicrobials including new cephalosporins, carbapenems, beta-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, oxazolidones, glycopeptides, and tetracyclines. conclusions: while numerous new compounds target resistant gram-positive pathogens and have been approved for clinical use, very few new molecules are active against mdr gram-negative pathogens, especially carbapenemase producers. new glycopeptides and oxazolidinones are highly efficient against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and new cephalosporins  and carbapenems also display activity toward mdr gram-positive bacteria. although new cephalosporins and carbapenems have acquired activity against mrsa, they offer few advantages against difficult-to-treat gram-negatives. among agents that are potentially active against mdr gram-negatives are ceftozolane/tazobactam, new carbapenems, the combination of avibactam with ceftazidime, and plazomicin. since a relevant number of promising antibiotics is currently in development, regulatory approvals over the next 5 years are crucial to face the growing threat of multidrug resistance.

TI  == microbiological analysis of bile and its impact in critically ill patients with secondary sclerosing cholangitis.
AB  == objectives: secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients (ssc-cip) is an emerging disease entity with unfavourable outcome. our aim was to analyze the microbial spectrum in bile of patients with ssc-cip and to evaluate the potential impact on the empiric antibiotic treatment in these patients. methods:  169 patients (72 patients with ssc-cip and 97 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc)) were included in a prospective observational study between 2010 and 2013. bile was obtained during endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (erc) and microbiologically analyzed. results: patients with ssc displayed a significantly different microbiological profile in bile. enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa and non-albicans species of candida were more frequent in  ssc compared to patients with psc (p < 0.05). patients with ssc showed a higher incidence of drug or multi-drug resistant organisms in bile (p = 0.001). the antimicrobial therapy was adjusted in 64% of patients due to resistance or presence of microorganisms not covered by the initial therapy regimen. conclusions: patients with ssc-cip have a distinct microbial profile in bile. difficult to treat organisms are frequent and an erc with bile fluid collection for microbiological analysis should be considered in case of insufficient antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == microbiological characterization of aquatic microbiomes targeting taxonomical marker genes and antibiotic resistance genes of opportunistic bacteria.
AB  == the dissemination of medically relevant antibiotic resistance genes (args) (blavim-1, vana, ampc, ermb, and meca) and opportunistic bacteria (enterococcus faecium/faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, and cns) was determined in different anthropogenically influenced aquatic habitats in a selected region of germany. over a period of two years, four differently sized wastewater treatment plants (wwtps) with and without clinical influence, three surface waters, four rain overflow basins, and three groundwater sites were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). results were calculated in cell equivalents per 100 ng of total dna extracted from water  samples and per 100 ml sample volume, which seems to underestimate the abundance  of antibiotic resistance and opportunistic bacteria. high abundances of opportunistic bacteria and arg were quantified in clinical wastewaters and influents of the adjacent wwtp. the removal capacities of wwtp were up to 99% for some, but not all investigated bacteria. the abundances of most arg targets were  found to be increased in the bacterial population after conventional wastewater treatment. as a consequence, downstream surface water and also some groundwater compartments displayed high abundances of all four args. it became obvious that the dynamics of the arg differed from the fate of the opportunistic bacteria. this underlines the necessity of an advanced microbial characterization of anthropogenically influenced environments.

TI  == antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
AB  == background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult  patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone  resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.

TI  == [the urinary bacterial flora in patients with cutaneous ureterostomy].
AB  == twenty-four patients with cutaneous ureterostomy at least 6 months after surgery  were included in this study. single-j ureteral catheters were indwelt in 7 patients. pouch urine was cultured and analyzed from asymptomatic patients and from those with pyelonephritis. forty-eight bacterial strains were isolated from  asymptomatic patients. thirty-five of these strains consisting of 18 species were isolated from the patients without ureteral catheters. enterococcus (e.) faecalis (20.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and proteus (p.) mirabilis (11. 4%) were isolated at high frequency. one methicilline-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus (mrcns) strain was isolated. thirteen bacterial strains consisting of 8 species were isolated from the patients with ureteral catheters. e. faecalis (23.1%), eschericia (e.) coli (23.1%) and pseudomonas (p.) aeruginosa (15.4%) were isolated at high frequency. one e. coli strain harboring extended-spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) and one mrcns strain were isolated. pyelonephritis occurred in 5 patients 14 times during follow-up for at least 6 months after surgery. the  patients with ureteral catheters suffered from pyelonephritis (4/7, 57.1%) more frequently as compared to the patients without catheters (1/17, 5.9%) (p = 0.014). p. aeruginosa (26.9%), e. faecium (15.4%), and p. mirabilis (11.5%) were  isolated inhigh frequency. one e. coli strain harboring esbl and one p. mirabilis strain harboring esbl were isolated. in conclusion, insertion of ureteral catheters in a cutaneous ureterostomy is a strong risk factor for pyelonephritis  and development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. therefore, urine culture is important in these patients who are under surveillance.

TI  == in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus  or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

TI  == which multidrug-resitant bacteria are emerging in patients with hematological malignancies?: one-year report.
AB  == the aim of this retrospective, observational study was to evaluate the outcomes of bacteremia attacks during neutropenic episodes caused by chemotherapy in patients with hematological cancers by assessing mortality, involved pathogens, antimicrobial therapy and treatment responses. patients who were older than 14 years of age and developed at least one neutropenic episode after chemotherapy to treat hematological cancer between november 2011 and november 2012 were included  in the study. we retrospectively collected demographic, treatment, and survival data for 68 patients with 129 neutropenic episodes. the mean age was 59.36 +/- 15.22 years (range 17-80 years), and 41 cases were male. the mean multinational association of supportive care in cancer score was 19.56 +/- 9.04. a total of 37  (28 %) bacteremia attacks were recorded in 20 cases (29 %). fatality rates were 50 % in the six cases with bacteremia caused by carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria; death occurred in two patients with carbapenem-resistant  acinetobacter baumannii and in one patient with carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas  aeruginosa. clinical and microbiological responses were achieved using pip-taz or cep-sul treatment in 80 % (16/20) of the cases with bacteremia caused by carbapenem-sensitive gram-negative bacteria (cs-gnb). during 547 colonization-days in 21 (30 %) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre)-colonized cases among 68 patients, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium bacteremia developed in two patients. non-carbapenem-based therapy can cure most bacteremia  attacks caused by cs-gnb in patients with hematological cancer. however, bacteremia and other infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens, such as a. baumannii, p. aeruginosa, and vre, are a growing concern in hematological patients.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activity of hyperimmune globulin preparations against multiresistant nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == purpose: we compared different immunoglobulin preparations containing igg (intraglobin/intratect) or a mixture of igg, iga, and igm (pentaglobin) to assess the opsonic and protective efficacy of human immunoglobulin preparations against  multiresistent nosocomial pathogens. materials and methods: clinical isolates of  e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus were tested by opsonophagocytic assay using immunologobulin preparations at dilutions usually obtained in patients. the target antigens of opsonic antibodies were characterized by opsonophagocytic inhibition assays, and the protective efficacy in vivo was tested in a mouse bacteremia model as previously described. results: all strains  were killed to at least 50% by pentaglobin. one p. aeruginosa strain was not efficiently killed by intraglobin (23%) but the other strains were killed by intraglobin to a similar degree compared to pentaglobin. opsonic igg antibodies against e. faecalis were directed against lta, while opsonic antibodies in pentaglobin were primarily directed against other cell wall carbohydrates. in a mouse bacteremia model, pentaglobin was more protective than intratect against staphylococcus aureus, while intratect reduced colony counts better than normal rabbit serum or saline. conclusions: all tested human immunoglobulin preparations contain opsonic and protective antibodies against targets present on multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. enrichment of these preparations with igm increases the protective efficacy against some strains, probably due to antibodies directed against cell wall carbohydrates.

TI  == isolation and characterization of large spectrum and multiple bacteriocin-producing enterococcus faecium strain from raw bovine milk.
AB  == aims: to assess the antimicrobial properties of lactic acid bacteria from tunisian raw bovine milk. methods and results: a bacteriocin-producing enterococcus faecium strain was isolated from raw cow milk with activity against  gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. antimicrobial substances produced by this strain were sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and were thermostable and resistant to a broad range of ph (2-10). mode of action of antimicrobial substances was determined as bactericidal. maximum activity was reached at the end of the exponential growth phase when checked against listeria ivanovii bug 496 (2366.62 au ml(-1)). however, maximum antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa 28753 was recorded at the beginning of the exponential growth phase. enterococcus faecium ggn7 was characterized as free from virulence  factors and was susceptible to tested antibiotics. pcr analysis of the micro-organism's genome revealed the presence of genes coding for enterocins a and b. mass spectrometry analysis of rp-hplc active fractions showed molecular masses corresponding to enterocins a (4835.77 da) and b (5471.56 da), and a peptide with a molecular mass of 3215.5 da active only against gram-negative indicator strains. the latter was unique in the databases. conclusions: enterococcus faecium ggn7 produces three bacteriocins with different inhibitory spectra. based on its antimicrobial properties and safety, ent. faecium ggn7 is potentially useful for food biopreservation. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest the bacteriocins from ggn7 strain could be useful for  food biopreservation.

TI  == blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in warsaw.
AB  == establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. a total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of  two transplantation wards of a large hospital in warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, bact/alert (biomerieux, france). the 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. the highest proportion were bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with escherichia coli (61 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. the non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). most frequent gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). of 77 staphylococcal strains,  56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 staphylococcus aureus. other gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). among all enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (esbls). resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of s aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples,  2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. both were enterococcus faecium. resistant strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.

TI  == impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
AB  == background: the phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. the current study was performed in order to  test the influence of different ast standards on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption. methods: automated ast was performed with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. from each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and mic data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by din and eucast, respectively. in addition cumulative ast data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new eucast mic breakpoints. results: the susceptibility rate of p. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of c. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of e. cloacae, s. marcescens, and m. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from din to eucast mic breakpoints. these changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of eucast mic breakpoints. conclusions: these data show that changes of ast breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption.

TI  == [prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in peking union medical college hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in peking union medical college  hospital. method: the incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. results: there were 449  positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. samples separated from patients with  community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. most community-aquired infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples.  respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were gram-negative (66.9%). the most common gram-negative bacteria included escherichia coli (13.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common gram-positive  bacteria. gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumonia/klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. the resistance to acinetobacter baumannii was serious. multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant a. baumannii acountted for 74% of all a. baumannii infections. stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. also, 22 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. fourteen  of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. there were 61  samples proved to be bacteria colonization. nonfermenters such as acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. conclusions: the pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly gram-negative bacteria. the incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.

TI  == frequency and clinical outcomes of eskape bacteremia in solid organ transplantation and the risk factors for mortality.
AB  == background: although bacteremias caused by the 6 eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) have recently been highlighted  as a serious complication in solid organ transplant (sot), more information is urgently needed. we sought to investigate the frequency and clinical outcomes of  eskape bacteremia in sot and determine the risk factors for mortality. methods: a retrospective analysis of bacteremia after sot was reviewed. risk factors for mortality caused by eskape bacteremia were identified. results: eighty-four episodes of bacteremia were caused by eskape strains. of these strains, 41 were caused by resistant eskape (reskape) organisms. the only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with eskape was septic shock (odds ratio [or] = 21.017, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 5.038-87.682, p < 0.001). the factors for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with reskape bacteremia were septic shock (or = 16.558, 95% ci = 6.620-104.668, p = 0.003) and age >/=40 years (or = 7.521, 95% ci = 1.196-47.292, p = 0.031). conclusions: to improve the outcomes of transplantation, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when older sot recipients with bacteremia due to eskape/reskape organisms present with septic shock.

TI  == bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  == the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial  cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would  allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.

TI  == transformation of human cathelicidin ll-37 into selective, stable, and potent antimicrobial compounds.
AB  == this letter reports a family of novel antimicrobial compounds obtained by combining peptide library screening with structure-based design. library screening led to the identification of a human ll-37 peptide resistant to chymotrypsin. this d-amino-acid-containing peptide template was active against escherichia coli but not methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). it possesses a unique nonclassic amphipathic structure with hydrophobic defects. by  repairing the hydrophobic defects, the peptide (17biphe2) gained activity against the eskape pathogens, including enterococcus faecium, s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species. in vitro, 17biphe2 could disrupt bacterial membranes and bind to dna. in vivo, the peptide prevented staphylococcal biofilm formation in a mouse model of  catheter-associated infection. meanwhile, it boosted the innate immune response to further combat the infection. because these peptides are potent, cell-selective, and stable to several proteases, they may be utilized to combat one or more eskape pathogens.

TI  == a broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens. combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature p. aeruginosa biofilms. in addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced p. aeruginosa pa14 preexisting biofilms. pcr studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial and in vitro wound healing properties of novel clay based bionanocomposite films.
AB  == the present study investigates the development of methyl cellulose (mc)-sodium alginate (sa)-montmorillonite (mmt) clay based bionanocomposite films with interesting wound healing properties. the differential scanning calorimetry analysis of the composite films revealed presence of single glass transition temperature (tg) confirming the miscible nature of the ternary blended films. the increase in mmt ratio in the composite films reduced the mobility of biopolymer chains (mc/sa) which increased the tg of the film. thermogravimetric analysis showed that dispersion of clay (mmt) at nano level significantly delayed the weight loss that correlated with higher thermal stability of the composite films. it was observed that the developed films were able to exhibit antimicrobial activity against four typical pathogenic bacteria found in the presence of wound. the developed films were able to significantly inhibit (10 mg/ml) the growth of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in vitro scratch assay indicated potential wound closure activities of mc-2-4 bionanocomposite films at their respective highest subtoxic doses. in conclusion, these ternary bionanocomposite  films were found to be promising systems for wound healing applications.

TI  == small molecular antibacterial peptoid mimics: the simpler the better!
AB  == the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria compounded by the depleting arsenal of antibiotics has accelerated efforts toward development of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action. in this report, we present a series of small molecular antibacterial peptoid mimics which exhibit high in vitro potency against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including drug-resistant species such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. the highlight of these compounds is their superior activity against the major nosocomial pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa. nontoxic toward mammalian cells, these rapidly bactericidal compounds primarily act by permeabilization and depolarization of bacterial membrane. synthetically simple and selectively antibacterial, these compounds can be developed into a newer class of therapeutic agents against multidrug resistant bacterial species.

TI  == a multidisciplinary intervention to reduce infections of esbl- and ampc-producing, gram-negative bacteria at a university hospital.
AB  == in response to a considerable increase in the infections caused by esbl/ampc-producing klebsiella pneumonia in 2008, a multidisciplinary intervention, with a main focus on antimicrobial stewardship, was carried out at  one university hospital. four other hospitals were used as controls. stringent guidelines for antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis were disseminated throughout the intervention hospital; cephalosporins were restricted for prophylaxis use only, fluoroquinolones for empiric use in septic shock only, and  carbapenems were selected for penicillin-allergic patients, infections due to esbl/ampc-producing and other resistant bacteria, in addition to their use in severe sepsis/septic shock. piperacillin-tazobactam +/- gentamicin was recommended for empiric treatments of most febrile conditions. the intervention also included education and guidance on infection control, as well as various other surveillances. two year follow-up data on the incidence rates of patients with selected bacterial infections, outcomes, and antibiotic consumption were assessed, employing before-and-after analysis and segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series, using the other hospitals as controls. the intervention led to a sustained change in antimicrobial consumption, and the incidence of patients infected with esbl-producing k. pneumoniae decreased significantly (p<0.001). the incidences of other hospital-associated infections also declined (p's<0.02), but piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium infections increased (p's<0.033). in wards with high antimicrobial consumption, the patient gut carrier rate of esbl-producing bacteria significantly decreased (p = 0.023). the unadjusted, all-cause 30-day mortality rates of k. pneumoniae and e. coli were unchanged over the four-year period, with similar results in all five hospitals. although not statistically significant, the 30-day mortality rate of patients with esbl-producing k. pneumoniae decreased, from 35% in 2008-2009, to 17% in 2010-2011. the two-year follow-up data indicated that this multidisciplinary intervention led to a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of esbl/ampc-resistant k. pneumoniae infections, as well as in the incidences of other typical hospital-associated bacterial infections.

TI  == could chloramphenicol be used against eskape pathogens? a review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
AB  == the widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'eskape' (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acintobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. however, it is still widely used in the developing world. in light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against eskape pathogens. susceptibility patterns for gram-positives were good, although less favorable for gram-negatives. however, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found  to have synergistic activity. the risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.

TI  == prevalence of antibiotic resistance in us hospitals.
AB  == the percentage of isolates resistant to essential antibiotics among clinically significant bacterial pathogens was evaluated using data from 80089 qualifying admissions in 19 us hospitals (2007-2010). percentage resistant was highest for the following pathogen/antibiotic pairs: enterococcus faecium/vancomycin (87.1% [95% ci 86.0-88.1] of 4024 isolates), staphylococcus aureus/oxacillin-methicillin (56.8% [56.1-57.4] of 23477 isolates), s. aureus/clindamycin (39.7% [39.1-40.4] of 21133 isolates), pseudomonas aeruginosa/fluoroquinolones (32.6% [31.8-33.5] of 10982 isolates), and escherichia coli/fluoroquinolones (31.3% [30.8-31.8] of 30715 isolates). the percentage resistant was 3.9% (3.2-4.9) for e. faecium/daptomycin (n = 2029 isolates). while these results are consistent with those from earlier studies in many respects, the percentage of e. faecium isolates resistant to daptomycin, while still small, is higher than has been reported to date.

TI  == validation of a novel murine wound model of acinetobacter baumannii infection.
AB  == patients recovering from traumatic injuries or surgery often require weeks to months of hospitalization, increasing the risk for wound and surgical site infections caused by eskape pathogens, which include a. baumannii (the eskape pathogens are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). as new therapies are being developed to counter a. baumannii infections, animal models are also needed to evaluate potential treatments. here, we present an excisional, murine wound model in which a diminutive inoculum of a clinically relevant, multidrug-resistant a. baumannii isolate can proliferate, form biofilms, and be effectively treated with antibiotics. the model requires a temporary, cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish an infection that can persist. a 6-mm-diameter, full-thickness wound was created in the skin overlying the thoracic spine, and after the wound bed was inoculated, it was covered with a dressing for 7 days. uninoculated control wounds healed within 13  days, whereas infected, placebo-treated wounds remained unclosed beyond 21 days.  treated and untreated wounds were assessed with multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques that included gross pathology, weight loss and recovery, wound closure, bacterial burden, 16s rrna community profiling, histopathology, peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy assessment of biofilms. the range of differences that we are able to identify with these measures in antibiotic- versus placebo-treated animals provides a clear window within which novel antimicrobial therapies can be assessed. the model can be used to evaluate antimicrobials for their ability to reduce specific pathogen loads in wounded tissues and clear biofilms. ultimately, the mouse model approach allows for highly powered studies and serves as an initial multifaceted in vivo assessment prior to testing in larger animals.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against gram-positive and gram-negative isolates collected from the middle east and africa between 2004 and 2011.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) was established in 2004 to monitor longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents, specifically tigecycline. in this study, susceptibility among gram-positive and gram-negative isolates between 2004 and 2011 from the middle east and africa was examined. antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) interpretive  criteria, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution methods. us food and drug administration (fda)-approved breakpoints were used for tigecycline. in total, 2967 gram-positive and 6322 gram-negative isolates were examined from 33 participating centres. all staphylococcus aureus isolates, including meticillin-resistant s. aureus, were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin. vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and levofloxacin were highly active (>97.6% susceptibility) against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-non-susceptible strains. all enterococcus faecium isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid, including 32 vancomycin-resistant isolates. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 16.6% of escherichia coli and 32.9% of klebsiella pneumoniae. more than 95% of e. coli and enterobacter spp. were susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem. the most active agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin (88.0% susceptible) and minocycline (64.2%  susceptible), respectively; the mic90 (mic required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) of tigecycline against a. baumannii was low at 2mg/l. tigecycline and carbapenem agents were highly active against most gram-negative pathogens. tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin showed good activity against most gram-positive pathogens from the middle east and africa.

TI  == novel method to identify the optimal antimicrobial peptide in a combination matrix, using anoplin as an example.
AB  == microbial resistance is an increasing health concern and a true danger to human well-being. a worldwide search for new compounds is ongoing, and antimicrobial peptides are promising lead candidates for tomorrow's antibiotics. the decapeptide anoplin (gllkriktll-nh2) is an especially interesting candidate because of its small size as well as its antimicrobial and nonhemolytic properties. optimization of the properties of an antimicrobial peptide such as anoplin requires multidimensional searching in a complex chemical space. typically, such optimization is performed by labor-intensive and costly trial-and-error methods. in this study, we show the benefit of fractional factorial design for identification of the optimal antimicrobial peptide in a combination matrix. we synthesized and analyzed a training set of 12 anoplin analogs, representative of 64 analogs in total. using mic, hemolysis, and high-performance liquid chromatography retention time data, we constructed analysis-of-variance models that describe the relationship between these properties and the structural characteristics of the analogs. we show that the mathematical models derived from the training set data can be used to predict the properties of other analogs in the chemical space. hence, this method provides an efficient means of identification of the optimal peptide in the searched chemical space.

TI  == pediatric antimicrobial susceptibility trends across the united states.
AB  == objective: antimicrobial susceptibility patterns across us pediatric healthcare institutions are unknown. a national pooled pediatric antibiogram (1) identifies  nationwide trends in antimicrobial resistance, (2) allows across-hospital benchmarking, and (3) provides guidance for empirical antimicrobial regimens for  institutions unable to generate pediatric antibiograms. methods: in january 2012, a request for submission of pediatric antibiograms between 2005 and 2011 was sent to 233 us hospitals. a summary antibiogram was compiled from participating institutions to generate proportions of antimicrobial susceptibility. temporal and regional comparisons were evaluated using chi(2) tests and logistic regression, respectively. results: of 200 institutions (85%) responding to our survey, 78 (39%) reported generating pediatric antibiograms, and 55 (71%) submitted antibiograms. carbapenems had the highest activity against the majority of gram-negative organisms tested, but no antibiotic had more than 90% activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. approximately 50% of all staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. western hospitals had significantly lower proportions of s. aureus that were methicillin resistant compared with all other  regions tested. overall, 21% of s. aureus isolates had resistance to clindamycin. among enterococcus faecium isolates, the prevalence of susceptibility to ampicillin (25%) and vancomycin (45%) was low but improved over time (p< .01), and 8% of e. faecium isolates were resistant to linezolid. southern hospitals reported significantly higher prevalence of e. faecium with susceptibilities to ampicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid compared with the other 3 regions (p< .01). conclusions: a pooled, pediatric antibiogram can identify nationwide antimicrobial resistance patterns for common pathogens and might serve as a useful tool for benchmarking resistance and informing national prescribing guidelines for children.

AB  == the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-iia primarily inactivates kanamycin and neomycin, whilst aph(3')-iiia also inactivates amikacin. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of both resistance genes in major human pathogens to obtain their baseline prevalence in the gene pool of these bacterial populations in austria. in total, 10 541 escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected representatively without selection bias between 2008 and 2011. isolates were analysed by aph(3')-iiia/nptiii- and aph(3')-iia/nptii-specific taqman real-time pcr. for positive strains, mics using etests were performed and resistance gene sequences  were determined. the overall prevalence of aph(3')-iiia/nptiii was 1.62 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.38-1.88 %). in escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococcus aureus, p. aeruginosa and salmonella spp., the aph(3')-iiia/nptiii prevalence was 0.47 % (0-1.47 %), 37.53 % (32.84-42.40 %), 2.90 % (1.51-5.02 %),  0 % (0-0.32 %) and 0 % (0-0.037 %), respectively. eleven of a total of 169 carriers showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistance allele. the overall prevalence of aph(3')-iia/nptii was 0.0096 % (0-0.046 %). escherichia coli (0-0.70 %), enterococci (0-0.75 %), staphylococcus aureus (0-0.73 %) and p.  aeruginosa (0-0.32 %) did not carry aph(3')-iia. a single salmonella isolate was  positive, resulting in an aph(3')-iia prevalence of 0.013 % (0-0.058 %). aph(3')-iiia/nptiii carriers were moderately prevalent in the strains tested except for in enterococci, which appeared to be an important reservoir for aph(3')-iiia. aph(3')-iia/nptii genes were detected at clinically irrelevant frequencies and played no significant role in the aminoglycoside resistance gene  pool during the observation period.

TI  == epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant eskape pathogens in cancer patients.
AB  == purpose: infection due to the six eskape pathogens has recently been identified as a serious emerging problem. however, there is still a lack of information on bacteremia caused by these organisms in cancer patients. we aimed to assess the epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant eskape pathogens (reskape) in patients with cancer. methods: all episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized adults with cancer from 2006  to 2011 were analyzed. results: of 1,148 episodes of bacteremia, 392 (34 %) were  caused by eskape pathogens. fifty-four episodes (4.7 %) were due to reskape strains (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium 0, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 13, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (eslb)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae 7, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 4, carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa 18 and derepression chromosomic ss-lactam and esbl-producing enterobacter species 12. risk factors independently associated with reskape bacteremia were comorbidities, prior antibiotic therapy, urinary catheter and urinary tract source. inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was more frequent in patients with reskape bacteremia than in the other cases (55.6 % vs. 21.5 %, p < 0.001). persistence of bacteremia (25 % vs. 9.7 %), septic metastasis (8 % vs. 4 %) and early case-fatality rate (23 % vs. 11 %) were more frequent in patients with reskape bacteremia than in patients with other etiologies (p < 0.05). conclusions: bacteremia due to reskape pathogens in cancer patients occurs mainly among those with comorbidities who have received prior antibiotic therapy and have a urinary tract source. these patients often receive inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy and have a poor outcome.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

AB  == antimicrobial resistance (r) surveillance across asia and especially in china has documented unique patterns and mechanisms. this 2011 study reports results for 2278 isolates from 12 hospitals in china (94-216 strains/site); most from bacteremia (20.4%), pneumonias (29.1%), or skin and skin structure infections (20.9%). samples were tested by reference broth microdilution methods, interpreted by published susceptibility (s) breakpoints. the most common species  were staphylococcus aureus (343, 45.8% mrsa), escherichia coli (ec; 288), pseudomonas aeruginosa (psa; 221), klebsiella spp. (ksp; 208), acinetobacters (acb; 178), enterobacters (155), streptococcus pneumoniae (spn; 154, 46.8% penicillin-s), and enterococci (ent; 137). among 849 gram-positive (gp) cocci, linezolid, tigecycline (tig), daptomycin, and vancomycin provided best antimicrobial coverage (>/=99.7% s). resistance patterns of concern were 0.3% visa, 15.4% teicoplanin non-s coagulase-negative staphylococci, 1.5% vancomycin-r ent (all enterococcus faecium), 1.9% levofloxacin-r beta-haemolytic streptococci, and 35.1 and 12.7% ceftriaxone-non-s rates for spn and viridans group streptococci, respectively. for gram-negative bacilli, r among enterobacteriaceae was highest against beta-lactams (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains at 73.6 and 42.8% in ec and ksp, respectively; carbapenem-r was only 2.1-4.3% with kpc and imp type enzymes detected in ksp). the widest spectrum agents were cefoperazone/sulbactam (79.5-86.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (88.9-92.0%), tig (98.6-100%), amikacin (amk; 91.8-93.7%), and meropenem (95.7-97.1% s). psa was most inhibited by amk (90.5% s) and colistin (col; 99.5%), with cefepime (67.9%) best among the tested beta-lactams. only col (100%  s) and tig (mic90, 2 mug/ml) showed significant potencies against acb. in conclusion, r among pathogens from 12 chinese hospitals illustrates several agents active against gp pathogens, but more serious r problems were noted among  enterobacteriaceae, psa, and acb. combination treatment for the latter multidrug-r strains appears necessary, guided by local antibiograms and national  surveillance results applying reference methods.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
AB  == there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial  materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential  applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.

TI  == new antibiotics for bad bugs: where are we?
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics is growing up day by day in both community and hospital setting, with a significant impact on the mortality and morbidity rates and the financial burden that is associated. in the last two decades multi  drug resistant microorganisms (both hospital- and community-acquired) challenged  the scientific groups into developing new antimicrobial compounds that can provide safety in use according to the new regulation, good efficacy patterns, and low resistance profile. in this review we made an evaluation of present data  regarding the new classes and the new molecules from already existing classes of  antibiotics and the ongoing trends in antimicrobial development. infectious diseases society of america (idsa) supported a program, called "the '10 x 20' initiative", to develop ten new systemic antibacterial drugs within 2020. the microorganisms mainly involved in the resistance process, so called the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae) were the  main targets. in the era of antimicrobial resistance the new antimicrobial agents like fifth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, beta-lactamases inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, oxazolidones, glycopeptides, and tetracyclines active against gram-positive pathogens, like vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) and mrsa, penicillin-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin resistant enterococcus (vre) but also against highly resistant gram-negative organisms are more than welcome. of these compounds some are already approved by  official agencies, some are still in study, but the need of new antibiotics still does not cover the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. therefore the management of antimicrobial resistance should also include fostering coordinated actions by all stakeholders, creating policy guidance, support for surveillance and technical assistance.

AB  == one of the most commonly used methods for assessing disinfectants in vitro is the dilution-neutralization test. although it is known that using an effective neutralizer is essential for obtaining reliable results, in the case of disinfectants like triclosan, whose neutralization is more complicated, an adequate neutralizer is not always used. here, we compare the efficacy of different neutralizers described previously, and others that have been modified,  against several antiseptic formulations of triclosan. the strains of reference used were pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the solutions of antiseptic were triclosan 2% aqueous solution, and three alcoholic solutions containing 2, 0.068 and 0.5% triclosan, respectively. in the dilution-neutralization test, six neutralizers with different degrees of complexity were assayed. our results show that the antiseptic solutions studied are effective against the strains of reference, with the exception of triclosan 2% aqueous solution against ps. aeruginosa. most neutralizers proved ineffective, depending on the antiseptic solution and the bacterial species, particularly in the case of staph. aureus. these findings confirm a need to test every neutralizer specifically for each disinfectant, at the maximum concentration used, and for every specific bacterial strain. significance and impact of the study: the choice of an adequate neutralizing agent is essential for obtaining precise results in the evaluation of disinfectants using the dilution-neutralization method. in this study, we show that the neutralization of triclosan and some of its commercial solutions is not  a simple task, requiring complex neutralizers. moreover, the action of the neutralizer is shown to depend on the micro-organism tested. specificity in view  of the disinfectant and the micro-organism calls for performing the neutralizing  assay in each particular case of application of the dilution-neutralization method. we also demonstrate that some of the neutralizers described for triclosan in previous studies are not sufficiently effective.

TI  == risk factors and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant eskape pathogens in solid-organ transplant recipients.
AB  == background: although infections due to the six eskape pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problem, information regarding bacteremia caused by these organisms in solid-organ transplant (sot) recipients is lacking.  we sought to determine the frequency, risk factors, and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant eskape (reskape) organisms in liver, kidney, and heart adult transplant recipients. methods: all episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized sot recipients from 2007 to 2012 were analyzed. results: of 276 episodes of bacteremia, 54 (19.6%) were due to reskape strains (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium [0], methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [5], extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella  pneumoniae [10], carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii [8], carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa [26], and derepressed chromosomal  beta-lactam and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacter species [5]). factors independently associated with reskape bacteremia were prior transplantation, septic shock, and prior antibiotic therapy. patients with reskape bacteremia more often received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy than the others (41% vs. 21.6%; p=0.01). overall case-fatality rate (30 days) was higher in patients with reskape bacteremia (35.2% vs. 14.4%; p=0.001). conclusions: bacteremia due to reskape pathogens is frequent in sot recipients and causes significant morbidity and mortality. reskape organisms should be considered when selecting empirical antibiotic therapy for hospitalized sot recipients presenting with septic shock, particularly those with prior transplantation and antibiotic use.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a uv-stable bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) produced by enterococcus faecium strain dsh20 against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains.
AB  == background/purpose: the narrow spectrum of action of most bacteriocins is an important limitation for their application as antimicrobial agents. the current study describes a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) that display extended spectrum antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains. methods: acquired resistance profiles of enterococcus isolates determined based on the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc) and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) definition as multidrug-resistant (mdr), extensively drug-resistant (xdr) and pandrug resistant (pdr). blis activity of enterococcus isolates was investigated  against enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) atcc 29212 as the indicator strain and clinical isolates including vre, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria containing pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), klebsiella, acinetobacter, and escherichia coli (e. coli). results:  among 273 enterococcus isolates, 27 and 2 vre isolates, respectively, were xdr and pdr and eight isolates had blis activity against the indicator strain. one of these isolates, identified as e. faecium strain dsh20 based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties, as well as its 16s rrna gene sequence, had potent blis production against all 29 vre strains, but had no activity against mrsa, p.  aeruginosa, klebsiella, acinetobacter, and e. coli strains. it was heat stable up to 121 degrees c for 15 minutes (autoclave condition), active within the ph range of 3-9 and had uv stability, but its activity disappeared by treatment with proteinase k, pepsin, and trypsin, demonstrating its proteinaceous nature. it was designated as an approximately 35kda peptide using the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) method. conclusion: this peptide is a potential agent for use as an alternative antibacterial agent for the treatment of drug-resistant strains of vre infection.

TI  == laboratory validation of an ozone device for recreational water treatment.
AB  == obtaining an accurate assessment of a treatment system's antimicrobial efficacy in recreational water is difficult given the large scale and high flow rates of the water systems. a laboratory test system was designed to mimic the water conditions and potential microbial contaminants found in swimming pools. this system was utilized to evaluate the performance of an in situ ozone disinfection  device against four microorganisms: cryptosporidium parvum, bacteriophage ms2, enterococcus faecium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the sampling regimen evaluated  the antimicrobial effectiveness in a single pass fashion, with samples being evaluated initially after exposure to the ozone unit, as well as at points downstream from the device. based on the flow dynamics and log reductions, cycle  threshold (ct) values were calculated. the observed organism log reductions were  as follows: >6.7 log for e. faecium and p. aeruginosa; >5.9 log for bacteriophage ms2; and between 2.7 and 4.1 log for c. parvum. the efficacy results indicate that the test system effectively functions as a secondary disinfection system as  defined by the centers for disease control and prevention's model aquatic health  code.

TI  == bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  == purpose: cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (bsis). most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. we here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in bsis in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. methods: we analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between january 2005 and january 2011. results: a total of 4,918 episodes of bsi  occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). in both patient groups, gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). amongst gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. amongst gram-negative organisms, escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following bsi compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. conclusion: these data demonstrate distinct bsi pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.

TI  == spectrum of pathogens in acute cholangitis in patients with and without biliary endoprosthesis.
AB  == background: knowledge of bacterial spectrum for acute cholangitis is essential for adequate empiric antibiotic treatment. main focus of the study was to analyse the spectrum of pathogens in acute cholangitis with and without biliary endoprosthesis. methods: retrospective cohort study of 1024 patients with acute cholangitis treated at a german tertiary center. results: 447 cholangitis episodes with positive bile and/or blood cultures obtained from 388 patients were studied. in total, 1088 pathogen were isolated. the predominant strains were enterococcus species (25%), followed by escherichia coli (18%) and klebsiella species (14%). bacteraemia was mainly caused by e. coli (91/282; 32%) and enterococcus species (550/282; 18%). the incidences of enterococcus species [121(74%) vs. 89(60%); p = 0.011] and non-fermenters [41(25%) vs. 16(11%); p = 0.001] were significantly higher in cholangitis episodes with biliary endoprosthesis compared to cholangitis episodes without biliary endoprosthesis. in particular, more pseudomonas aeruginosa [27(16%) vs. 12(8%); p = 0.027] and enterococcus faecium [59(36%) vs. 34(23%); p = 0.013] were isolated from patients with a biliary endoprosthesis. conclusions: unlike cholangitis without stent, the presence of biliary endoprosthesis in patients with cholangitis can serve as a surrogate indicator of nosocomial pathogens and therefore should be considered, when selecting empiric antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria collected from countries in eastern europe: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) 2004-2010.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) commenced in 2004 to longitudinally monitor global changes in bacterial susceptibility to a suite of antimicrobial agents. the current study examined the activity of tigecycline and  comparators against isolates collected across eastern europe between 2004 and 2010. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution methodologies. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using clsi interpretive criteria, and tigecycline susceptibility was established using european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints. this study included 10 295 gram-negative and 4611 gram-positive isolates from 42 centres. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were reported among 15.3% of escherichia coli and 39.3% of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; the highest rates were observed in turkey (30.9%) and bulgaria (53.8%), respectively. imipenem-non-susceptible k. pneumoniae were identified only in turkey. esbl-positive e. coli were highly susceptible to imipenem (95.1%), meropenem (98.0%) and tigecycline (98.5%). most antimicrobials showed poor activity against acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. vancomycin resistance was noted among 0.9% of enterococcus faecalis and 11.7% of enterococcus faecium isolates. high rates of susceptibility were reported for linezolid (99.7%) and tigecycline (100%) against e. faecium. one-quarter of staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), with the highest rate in romania (51.5%); all mrsa were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. antimicrobial resistance is high in much of eastern europe, with considerable variation seen among countries. tigecycline and the carbapenems retain excellent activity against many pathogens from eastern europe; linezolid and vancomycin are active against most gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == one-year surveillance of eskape pathogens in an intensive care unit of monterrey, mexico.
AB  == background: bacterial species from the eskape group (i.e. enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species) are frequently resistant to antibiotics. the purpose of this study was to monitor the incidence of eskape pathogens at the intensive care unit (icu) of a tertiary care hospital in monterrey, mexico. methods: all clinically relevant organisms isolated from june  2011 to june 2012 were included. identification and susceptibility testing was performed using panels from sensititre. resistance to oxacillin, for s. aureus, and the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), for k. pneumonia, were determined as defined by the clinical laboratory standards institute. also, the presence of vana and vanb genes was determined in e. faecium vancomycin (van)-resistant isolates. results: the majority of pathogens (64.5%) isolated in the icu unit were from the eskape group. the organisms most frequently isolated were a. baumannii (15.8%) and p. aeruginosa (14.3%). a high resistance to carbapenems was detected for a. baumannii (75.3%) while 62% of s. aureus isolates were confirmed to be methicillin resistant. of the k. pneumoniae  isolates, 36.9% were esbl producers. we detected three e. faecium van-resistant isolates, all of which contained the vana gene. conclusion: the presence of the eskape group of pathogens is a major problem in the icu setting. the results of this study support the implementation of special antimicrobial strategies to specifically target these microorganisms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal activity of methanol extracts of crabapple mangrove tree (sonneratia caseolaris linn.) against multi-drug resistant pathogens.
AB  == the crabapple mangrove tree, sonneratia caseolaris linn. (family: sonneratiaceae), is one of the foreshore plants found in estuarine and tidal creek areas and mangrove forests. bark and fruit extracts from this plant have previously been shown to have an anti-oxidative or cytotoxic effect, whereas flower extracts of this plant exhibited an antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. according to the traditional folklore, it is medicinally used as an astringent and antiseptic. hence, this investigation was carried out on the extract of the leaves, pneumatophore and different parts of the flower or fruit (stamen, calyx, meat of fruit, persistent calyx of fruit and seeds) for antibacterial activity using the broth microdilution method. the antibacterial activity was evaluated against five antibiotic-sensitive species (three gram-positive and two gram-negative bacteria) and six drug-resistant species (gram-positive i.e. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and gram-negative i.e. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-escherichia coli, multidrug-resistant-pseudomonas aeruginosa and acenetobacter baumannii). the methanol extracts from all tested parts of the crabapple mangrove tree exhibited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but was mainly a bactericidal against the gram-negative bacteria, including the multidrug-resistant strains, when compared with only bacteriostatic on the gram-positive bacteria. using soxhlet apparatus, the extracts obtained by sequential extraction with hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate revealed no discernable antibacterial activity  and only slightly, if at all, reduced the antibacterial activity of the subsequently obtained methanol extract. therefore, the active antibacterial compounds of the crabapple mangrove tree should have a rather polar structure.

TI  == recent trends in resistance to cell envelope-active antibacterial agents among key bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cell envelope-active agents, particularly beta-lactams, play a pivotal role in the treatment of bacterial infections and the extent to which their activity is affected by the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms is of concern. we analyzed the surveillance network (tsn) database to evaluate resistant trends for key cell envelope-active drugs among eskape pathogens. analysis demonstrated that the activity of these drugs has been notably influenced by the emergence of multidrug resistance; this was especially evident for the beta-lactam drugs. for  example, acinetobacter baumannii resistance to imipenem increased from 23.9% to 34.3%, and resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam increased from 37.0% to 49.7% between 2007 and 2011. during the same time period klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to imipenem increased from 0.8% to 3.8%. as beta-lactams are a cornerstone of anti-infective therapy, it is important to closely monitor the activity of the agents being used today and to aggressively pursue new strategies that can augment current drugs and thwart ever-emerging beta-lactam resistance mechanisms that are continuously encountered.

TI  == using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  == new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology  laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acid exhibit potent bactericidal activity against eskape pathogens.
AB  == a series of 36 synthetic antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acids  were screened to determine their effectiveness to treat enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pnemoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens, which are known to commonly infect chronic wounds. the primary amino acid sequences of these peptides incorporate either three or six dipeptide units consisting of the unnatural amino acids tetrahydroisoquinolinecarboxylic acid (tic) and octahydroindolecarboxylic acid (oic). the tic-oic dipeptide units are separated by spacer amino acids with specific physicochemical properties that control how these peptides interact with bacterial cell membranes of different chemical compositions. these peptides exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against these pathogens in the range from >100 to 6.25 mug/ml. the observed diversity of mic values for these peptides against the various bacterial strains  are consistent with our hypothesis that the complementarity of the physicochemical properties of the peptide and the lipid of the bacteria's cell membrane determines the resulting antibacterial activity of the peptide.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == ultraviolet disinfection of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their antibiotic resistance genes in water and wastewater.
AB  == disinfection of wastewater treatment plant effluent may be an important barrier for limiting the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (arbs) and antibiotic resistance genes (args). while ideally disinfection should destroy args, to prevent horizontal gene transfer to downstream bacteria, little is known about the effect of conventional water disinfection technologies on args. this study examined the potential of uv disinfection to damage four args, mec(a), van(a), tet(a), and amp(c), both in extracellular form and present within a host arbs: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre), escherichia coli sms-3-5, and pseudomonas aeruginosa  01, respectively. an extended amplicon-length quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was developed to enhance capture of arg damage events and also to  normalize to an equivalent length of target dna ( approximately 1000 bp) for comparison. it was found that the two gram-positive arbs (mrsa and vre) were more resistant to uv disinfection than the two gram-negative arbs (e. coli and p. aeruginosa). the two gram-positive organisms also possessed smaller total genome  sizes, which could also have reduced their susceptibility to uv because of fewer  potential pyrimidine dimer targets. an effect of cell type on damage to args was  only observed in vre and p. aeruginosa, the latter potentially because of extracellular polymeric substances. in general, damage of args required much greater uv doses (200-400 mj/cm(2) for 3- to 4-log reduction) than arb inactivation (10-20 mj/cm(2) for 4- to 5-log reduction). the proportion of amplifiable args following uv treatment exhibited a strong negative correlation with the number of adjacent thymines (pearson r < -0.9; p < 0.0001). arbs surviving uv treatment were negatively correlated with total genome size (pearson r < -0.9; p < 0.0001) and adjacent cytosines (pearson r < -0.88; p < 0.0001) but  positively correlated with adjacent thymines (pearson r > 0.85; p < 0.0001). this suggests that formation of thymine dimers is not the sole mechanism of arb inactivation. overall, the results indicate that uv is limited in its potential to damage args and other disinfection technologies should be explored.

AB  == background: the antimicrobial effects of a coating of molybdenum trioxide (moo3)  has been recently described. the metalloacid material produces oxonium ions (h3o+), which creates an acidic ph that is an effective, non specific antimicrobial. we determined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of molybdenum trioxide metalloacid-coated surfaces. methods: metalloacid-coated and non-coated  (control) surfaces were contaminated by exposing them for 15 minutes to microbial suspensions containing 105 cfu/ml. eleven microorganisms responsible for nosocomial infections were tested: two staphylococcus aureus strains (the hetero-vancomycin intermediate mrsa mu50 strain and a st80-pvl-producing mrsa strain); a vancomycin-resistant vana enterococcus faecium strain; three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae strains; a mbl-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strain; a multidrug-resistant acinetobacter  baumannii strain; a toxin-producing clostridium difficile strain; and two fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus). the assay tested the ability of the coated surfaces to kill microorganisms. results: against all non-sporulating microorganisms tested, metalloacid-coated surfaces exhibited significant antimicrobial activity relative to that of the control surfaces within two to six hours after contact with the microorganisms (p < 0.001). microorganism survival on the coated surfaces was greatly impaired, whereas microorganism survival on control surfaces remained substantial. conclusions: we suggest that, facing the continuing shedding of microorganisms in the vicinity of colonized or infected patients, the continuous biocidal effect of hydroxonium oxides against multidrug-resistant microorganisms may help limit environmental contamination between consecutive cleaning procedures.

TI  == estimating the burden of healthcare-associated infections caused by selected multidrug-resistant bacteria finland, 2010.
AB  == background: knowledge of the burden of healthcare-associated infections (hai) and antibiotic resistance is important for resource allocation in infection control.  although national surveillance networks do not routinely cover all hais due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, estimates are nevertheless possible: in the eu, 25,000 patients die from such infections annually. we assessed the burden of hais due to multidrug-resistant bacteria in finland in 2010. methods: by combining data from the national infectious disease registry on the numbers of bacteremias  caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., and susceptibility data from the national antimicrobial resistance network and the finnish hospital infection program, we assessed the numbers of healthcare-associated bacteremias due to selected multidrug-resistant  bacteria. we estimated the number of pneumonias, surgical site and urinary tract  infections by applying the ratio of these infections in the first national prevalence survey for hai in 2005. attributable hai mortality (3.2%) was also derived from the prevalence survey. results: the estimated annual number of the most common hais due to the selected multidrug-resistant bacteria was 2804 (530 hais per million), 6% of all hais in finnish acute care hospitals. the number of  attributable deaths was 89 (18 per million). conclusions: resources for infection control should be allocated not only in screening and isolation of carriers of multidrug-resistant bacteria, even when they are causing a small proportion of all hais, but also in preventing all clinical infections.

TI  == influence of the n- and c-terminal regions of antimicrobial peptide pleurocidin on antibacterial activity.
AB  == pleurocidin, a 25-mer antimicrobial peptide, has been known to exhibit potent antibacterial activity. to investigate the functional roles in n- and c-terminal  regions of pleurocidin on the antibacterial activity, we designed four truncated  analogs. the antibacterial susceptibility testing showed that pleurocidin and its analogs exerted antibacterial effect against various bacterial strains and further possessed specific activity patterns corresponding with their hydrophobic scale [pleurocidin &gt; anal 3 (1-22) > anal 1 (4-25) > anal 4 (1-19) > anal 2 (7-25)]. fluorescence experiments using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (dph) and 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide [disc3(5)] indicated that the differences  in antibacterial activity of the peptides were caused by its membrane-active mechanisms including membrane disruption and depolarization. blue shift in tryptophan fluorescence demonstrated that the decrease in net hydrophobicity attenuates the binding affinity of pleurocidin to interact with plasma membrane.  therefore, the present study suggests that hydrophobicity in the n- and c-terminal regions of pleurocidin plays a key role in its antibacterial activity.

TI  == a comparative study to determine the recovery rate of microorganisms of bloodstream infections: two versus three blood culture specimens.
AB  == objective: there has been a development of automated and continuous-monitoring blood culture systems that are more sensitive than conventional systems for the detection of microorganisms. whether two or three blood culture specimens obtained during a 24-hour period using these automated systems achieving a higher recovery rate of microorganism remains to be determined. the present study was aimed to compare the recovery rates of microorganism of blood-stream infections (bsis) using two and three blood culture specimens. material and method: a prospective investigator-blinded study was carried out in patients who needed to  have blood cultures in medicine wards and intensive care units as well as an emergency room of king chulalongkorn memorial hospital, bangkok, thailand, between october 1, 2010 and march 31, 2011. three blood culture specimens were obtained from each patient during a 24-hour period. each specimen was inoculated  into an aerobic bottle of blood culture broth (trek diagnostics, cleveland, oh, us), and then incubated at 37 degrees c for seven days. results: of 568 patients, there were 116 (20.4%) unimicrobial episodes with three blood cultures obtained during a 24-hour period. there were 70 (12.3%) and 46 (8.1%) episodes of true pathogen and contaminant, respectively. the recovery rates of true pathogen were  75.7% (53 isolates), 87.1% (61 isolates), and 100% (70 isolates) with the first,  second, and third blood culture specimens, respectively (p < 0.05 between the recovery rate with the first two and the third blood culture specimens). there were 25 (35.7%), 38 (58.6%) isolates, and four (5.7%) of gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, respectively. among 25 gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate (10, 14.3%), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (5, 7.1%) and enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococcus (3, 10% each). among 38 gram-negative  bacteria, escherichia coli was the most common isolate (13, 18. 6%), followed by  pseudomonas aeruginosa (8, 11.4%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.6%). the sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using two blood culture specimens were 85.7% and 92.3%, respectively. the sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using three blood culture specimens were 100% and 90.8%, respectively. conclusion: to the best of the authors'knowledge, the present study is the first prospective study to compare the recovery rate of microorganisms of bsis between the two and three blood culture specimens using the versatrek blood culture system. three blood culture specimens are required to achieve the recovery rate of more than 99%.

TI  == exposure to clinical x-ray radiation does not alter antibiotic susceptibility or  genotype profile in gram-negative and gram-positive clinical pathogens.
AB  == inadvertent exposure of bacterial pathogens to x-ray radiation may be an environmental stress, where the bacterium may respond by increasing mutational events, thereby potentially resulting in increased antibiotic resistance and alteration to genotypic profile. in order to examine this, four clinical pathogens, including the gram-negative organisms escherichia coli o157:h7 nctc12900 and pseudomonas aeruginosa nctc10662, as well as the gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus nctc6571 and enterococcus faecium were exposed to x-rays (35,495 cgy/cm2) over a seven-day period. antibiotic susceptibility was assessed before, during and after exposure by examining susceptibility, as quantified by e-test with six antibiotics, as well as to a further 11 antibiotics by measurement of susceptibility zone sizes (mm). additionally, the dna profile of each organism was compared before, during and after exposure employing the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (eric pcr). results indicated that exposure of these organisms to this amount of x-ray  radiation did not alter their antibiotic susceptibility, nor their genomic dna profile. overall, these data indicate that exposure of bacteria to x-ray radiation does not alter the test organisms' antibiotic susceptibility profiles,  nor alter genomic dna profiles of bacteria, which therefore does not compromise molecular epidemiological tracking of bacteria within healthcare environments in  which patients have been exposed to x-ray radiation.

TI  == adenylate kinase release as a high-throughput-screening-compatible reporter of bacterial lysis for identification of antibacterial agents.
AB  == adenylate kinase (ak) is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is released into  the extracellular space upon cell lysis. we have shown that ak release serves as  a useful reporter of bactericidal agent activity and can be exploited for antimicrobial screening purposes. the ak assay exhibits improved sensitivity over that of growth-based assays and can detect agents that are active against bacteria in clinically relevant growth states that are difficult to screen using  conventional approaches, such as small colony variants (scv) and bacteria within  established biofilms. the usefulness of the ak assay was validated by screening a library of off-patent drugs for agents that exhibit antimicrobial properties toward a variety of bacterial species, including escherichia coli and all members of the "eskape" pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). the assay detected antibiotics within the library that were expected to be active against the organism screened. moreover, 38 drugs with no previously reported antibacterial activity elicited ak release. four of these  were acquired, and all were verified to exhibit antimicrobial activity by standard susceptibility testing. two of these molecules were further characterized. the antihistamine, terfenadine, was active against s. aureus planktonic, scv population, and biofilm-associated cells. tamoxifen, an estrogen  receptor antagonist, was active toward e. faecium in vitro and also reduced e. faecium pathogenesis in a galleria mellonella infection model. our data demonstrate that the ak assay provides an attractive screening approach for identifying new antimicrobial agents. further, terfenadine and tamoxifen may represent novel antimicrobial drug development scaffolds.

TI  == national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid) funding for studies  of hospital-associated bacterial pathogens: are funds proportionate to burden of  disease?
AB  == background: hospital-associated infections (hais) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. the pathogens that cause the majority of serious hais are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, referred as esckape. we aimed to determine the amount of funding the national institute of health (nih) national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly  esckape pathogens. methods: the nih research portfolio online reporting tools (report) database was used to identify niaid antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." results: funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. the total funding for all eskcape pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. s. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in fy2009, the highest funding amount of all the esckape pathogens. based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per s. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per c. difficile related death. conclusions: although the funding for esckape pathogens  has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.

TI  == synergistic effects between silver nanoparticles and antibiotics and the mechanisms involved.
AB  == silver nanoparticles (nano-ags), which have well-known antimicrobial properties,  are used extensively in various medical and general applications. in this study,  the combination effects between nano-ags and the conventional antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin against various pathogenic bacteria were investigated. the mic and fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) were determined to confirm antibacterial susceptibility and synergistic effects.  the results showed that nano-ags possessed antibacterial effects and synergistic  activities. the antibiofilm activities of nano-ags alone or in combination with antibiotics were also investigated. formation of biofilm is associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents and chronic bacterial infections. the results  indicated that nano-ags also had antibiofilm activities. to understand these effects of nano-ags, an atpase inhibitor assay, permeability assay and hydroxyl radical assay were conducted. the antibacterial activity of nano-ags was influenced by atp-associated metabolism rather than by the permeability of the outer membrane. additionally, nano-ags generated hydroxyl radicals, a highly reactive oxygen species induced by bactericidal agents. it was concluded that nano-ags have potential as a combination therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious diseases by bacteria.

TI  == experience with fosfomycin for treatment of urinary tract infections due to multidrug-resistant organisms.
AB  == fosfomycin has shown promising in vitro activity against multidrug-resistant (mdr) urinary pathogens; however, clinical data are lacking. we conducted a retrospective chart review to describe the microbiological and clinical outcomes  of urinary tract infections (utis) with mdr pathogens treated with fosfomycin tromethamine. charts for 41 hospitalized patients with a urine culture for an mdr pathogen who received fosfomycin tromethamine from 2006 to 2010 were reviewed. forty-one patients had 44 urinary pathogens, including 13 carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (cr-kp), 8 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 7 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) isolates, 7 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers, and 9 others. in vitro fosfomycin susceptibility was 86% (median mic, 16 mug/ml; range, 0.25 to 1,024 mug/ml). patients received an average of 2.9 fosfomycin doses per treatment course. the overall microbiological cure was 59%; failure was due to either relapse (24%) or reinfection uti (17%). microbiological cure rates by pathogen were 46% for cr-kp, 38% for p. aeruginosa, 71% for vre, 57% for esbl producers, and 100% for others.  microbiological cure (n = 24) was compared to microbiological failure (n = 17). there were significantly more solid organ transplant recipients in the microbiological failure group (59% versus 21%; p = 0.02). none of the patients in the microbiological cure group had a ureteral stent, compared to 24% of patients  within the microbiological failure group (p = 0.02). fosfomycin demonstrated in vitro activity against utis due to mdr pathogens. for cr-kp, there was a divergence between in vitro susceptibility (92%) and microbiological cure (46%).  multiple confounding factors may have contributed to microbiological failures, and further data regarding the use of fosfomycin for utis due to mdr pathogens are needed.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == novel model to study combined effects of microorganisms and oxidants on development of intestinal necrosis.
AB  == background: although the cause of intestinal necrosis in diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is multi-factorial, oxidants and bacteria likely  are key factors. many animal models of nec generate histologic necrosis, but it is rare to see the gross necrosis that is observed in infants. here, we present a novel model that produces full-thickness intestinal necrosis when chloramine-t, an oxidizing agent, is introduced directly into isolated intestinal loops. the aim of this study was to determine the role of bacteria in this model. methods: three-week-old mice underwent isolated ileal loop construction by suture ligation, and either chloramine-t or saline was injected into the loop. intestines were then returned to the abdominal cavity, and the incision was closed for 24 h, after which the intestinal loops were analyzed histologically and microbiologically. to determine if bacteria home to the site of injury, some  mice had intracecal injection of luminescent pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa). these mice were sacrificed 2, 6, 8, and 24 h later, and luminescent bacteria were localized via photon camera imaging. results: no gross necrosis was observed in the saline-treated group, but 59% of the animals in the chloramine-t-treated group had necrosis (p<0.001). relative bacterial species numbers were calculated  for untreated control animals and those with saline-treated loops and chloramine-t-treated loops without and with necrosis. lactobacillus was detected  in 60% of the control animals but was absent in all animals that underwent surgery. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, pa, and enterococcus faecium were present only in animals that underwent loop construction; however, bacterial communities did not differ according to loop treatment or the presence  or absence of necrosis. after intracecal injection of pa, bacteria homed to the loop and proximal bowel even though the loop was discontinuous with the remaining bowel. conclusions: intraluminal chloramine-t causes full-thickness necrosis in three-week-old mice and is characterized by a loss of probiotic bacteria such as  lactobacillus. necrotic loops of bowel become colonized rapidly with pathogenic bacteria by unconventional mechanisms. oxidant stress and colonization by pathogenic bacteria may play important roles in intestinal necrosis across a wide spectrum of pathologic states, including nec.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by eskape organisms: cause, clinical features, and management.
AB  == purpose of review: despite important geographical variations, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) episodes. their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on icu patients' outcome. this review updates information on vap due to eskape pathogens. recent findings: although methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus vap may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. local  colonization determines treatment options. the contribution of tracheobronchitis  is an important issue. minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for  nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria vap to prescribe extended infusion beta-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by eskape pathogens. summary: vap due to eskape pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity.

TI  == prevalence and risk factors of infections by multiresistant bacteria in cirrhosis: a prospective study.
AB  == epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical effect of infections by multiresistant bacteria in cirrhosis are poorly known. this work was a prospective evaluation in two series of cirrhotic patients admitted with infection or developing infection  during hospitalization. the first series was studied between 2005 and 2007 (507 bacterial infections in 223 patients) and the second between 2010 and 2011 (162 bacterial infections in 110 patients). in the first series, 32% of infections were community acquired (ca), 32% healthcare associated (hca), and 36% nosocomial. multiresistant bacteria (92 infections; 18%) were isolated in 4%, 14%, and 35% of these infections, respectively (p < 0.001). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esbl-e; n = 43) was the main multiresistant organism identified, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 17),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n = 14), and enterococcus faecium (n = 14). the efficacy of currently recommended empirical antibiotic therapy was very low in nosocomial infections (40%), compared to hca and ca episodes (73% and 83%, respectively; p < 0.0001), particularly in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia (26%, 29%, and 44%, respectively). septic shock (26% versus 10%; p < 0.0001) and mortality rate (25%  versus 12%; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in infections caused by multiresistant strains. nosocomial origin of infection (hazard ratio [hr], 4.43), long-term norfloxacin prophylaxis (hr, 2.69), recent infection by multiresistant  bacteria (hr, 2.45), and recent use of beta-lactams (hr, 2.39) were independently associated with the development of multiresistant infections. results in the second series were similar to those observed in the first series. conclusions: multiresistant bacteria, especially esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, are frequently isolated in nosocomial and, to a lesser extent, hca infections in cirrhosis, rendering third-generation cephalosporins clinically ineffective. new  antibiotic strategies tailored according to the local epidemiological patterns are needed for the empirical treatment of nosocomial infections in cirrhosis.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == improved antibiotic-impregnated catheters with extended-spectrum activity against resistant bacteria and fungi.
AB  == minocycline-rifampin-impregnated central venous catheters (m/r cvcs) have been shown to be efficacious in reducing catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsi) and inhibiting the biofilm adherence of resistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida spp. to expand the spectrum of antimicrobial activity, a novel second-generation  m/r catheter was developed by adding chlorhexidine (chx-m/r). cvcs and peripherally inserted central catheters (piccs) were impregnated with chx-m/r and compared with first-generation m/r catheters, chx-silver sulfadiazine-treated cvcs (chx/ss-cvcs), chlorhexidine-treated piccs, and uncoated catheters. a biofilm catheter colonization model was used to assess the efficacy of catheters  against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant  enterococcus faecium (vre), p. aeruginosa, candida albicans, and candida glabrata. chx-m/r-impregnated cvcs were the only antimicrobial catheters that completely inhibited the biofilm colonization of all resistant bacterial and fungal organisms tested at all time intervals, and they were significantly superior to uncoated catheters (all p values were </=0.003). furthermore, chx-m/r-coated cvcs had a significantly more effective and prolonged (up to 3 weeks) antimicrobial activity against mrsa and p. aeruginosa than m/r, chx/ss, and uncoated cvcs (p < 0.0001). similarly, chx-m/r-coated piccs were also superior to m/r-coated and chx-coated piccs in preventing biofilms of mrsa, vre,  p. aeruginosa, and candida species (p value = 0.003 for all). our study shows that novel chx-m/r-coated catheters have unique properties in completely inhibiting biofilm colonization of mrsa, vre, p. aeruginosa, and fungi in a manner superior to that of m/r- and chlorhexidine-treated catheters.

TI  == catecholthioether derivatives: preliminary study of in-vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.
AB  == in this research, synthesis, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of a series of catecholthioethers having benzoxazole and tetrazole moieties are described. antimicrobial activity was evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay. the synthesized compounds were tested in vitro against three gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus (clinical isolated), staphylococcus aureus atcc 25922, enterococcus faecium (clinical isolated), and two gram-negative bacteria including klebsiella pneumoniae (clinical isolated) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853 and the yeast candida albicans in comparison with control drugs. microbiological results indicated that the synthesized compounds possessed a broad spectrum of activity against the tested microorganisms at mic values between 4-256 mug/ml. this shows compounds having tetrazole moiety were the most active against gram-negative strains, whereas compounds having benzoxazole moiety were more active against gram-positive ones. also both of them showed significant antifungal activity against candida albicans and had lower activity than the compared control drugs (sulfamethoxazole and fluconazole). the  antioxidant activity was assessed using two methods, including, 1,1-biphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging, and reducing power assays. some of the catecholthioether derivatives showed antioxidant activity more than trolox and butylated hydroxyanisole (bha) as reference antioxidants.

TI  == controlled performance evaluation of the diversilab repetitive-sequence-based genotyping system for typing multidrug-resistant health care-associated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == fast, reliable, and versatile typing tools are essential to differentiate among related bacterial strains for epidemiological investigation and surveillance of health care-associated infection with multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens. the diversilab (dl) system is a semiautomated repetitive-sequence-based pcr system designed for rapid genotyping. the dl system performance was assessed by comparing its reproducibility, typeability, discriminatory power, and concordance with those of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and by assessing its epidemiological concordance on well-characterized mdr bacterial strains (n = 165). these included vana enterococcus faecium, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii, and esbl- or metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. the dl system showed very good performance for e. faecium and k. pneumoniae and good performance for other species, except for a discrimination index of <95% for a. baumannii and e. coli (93.9% and 93.5%, respectively) and incomplete concordance with mlst for p. aeruginosa (78.6%) and e. coli (97.0%). occasional violations of mlst assignment by dl types were noted for e. coli. complete epidemiological concordance was observed for all pathogens, as all outbreak-associated strains clustered in identical dl types that were distinct from those of unrelated strains. in conclusion, the dl system showed good to excellent performance, making it a reliable typing tool for investigation of outbreaks caused by study pathogens, even though it was generally less discriminating than pfge analysis. for e. coli and p. aeruginosa, mlst cannot be  reliably inferred from dl type due to phylogenetic group violation or discordance.

TI  == further increases in carbapenem-, amikacin-, and fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates of acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa in korea: konsar study 2009.
AB  == purpose: the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria has become a serious worldwide problem. the aim of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance data generated in 2009 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the korean nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance program. materials and methods: susceptibility data were collected from 24 hospitals and two commercial laboratories. in the analysis, resistance did not include intermediate susceptibility. duplicate isolates were excluded from the analysis of hospital isolates, but not from the commercial laboratory isolates. results: among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin g-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae based on meningitis  breakpoint, and ampicillin- resistant enterococcus faecium remained highly prevalent. the proportion of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium gradually increased  to 29%. ceftazidime-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae increased to 17% and 33%, respectively, and fluoroquinolone-resistant k. pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa increased to 33%, 67% and 39%, respectively. amikacin-resistant acinetobacter spp. increased to 48%. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa increased to 51% and 26%, respectively. higher resistance rates were observed in intensive care unit (icu)  isolates than in non-icu isolates among the isolates from hospitals. resistance rates were higher in hospital isolates than in clinic isolates among the isolates from commercial laboratories. conclusion: among the hospital isolates, ceftazidime-resistant k. pneumoniae and fluoroquinolone- resistant k. pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp., and p. aeruginosa further increased. the increase in imipenem resistance was slight in p. aeruginosa, but drastic in acinetobacter spp. the problematic antimicrobial-organism combinations were much more prevalent among icu isolates.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == [trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in romania. experience of participation in earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system), 2002-2008].
AB  == earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial  resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and csf), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecium/faecalis,  str. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae. romania reported data to earss since 2002 so far. though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for earss. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. this issue is related to the particular position of romania in the european  context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the  indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. during the 2002-2008 interval, romania reported to earss a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 s aureus, 369 e. coli, 128 streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 enterococcus spp.. 71 klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the  earss protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. it is difficult to describe trends, specially in enterococcus, streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in  invasive isolates is a real problem in romanian hospitals, like in other central, southern and south eastern european countries: more than 25% of s. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.

TI  == spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  == bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. the characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. the  clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation  from january 1997 to march 2006 were reviewed. one hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (gpb), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (gnb). nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset gpb or gnb versus patients with late-onset gpb (66.7% versus 23.7%, p < 0.001) or gnb (70.6% versus 20.0%, p = 0.001). peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, p = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, p = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset gpb versus patients with late-onset gpb. likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset gnb than late-onset gnb (41.2% versus 6.7%, p = 0.007). staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset  gpb, whereas enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus species were most common in  patients with late-onset gpb. pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most  common pathogens in patients with early-onset gnb, whereas escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset gnb. in conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.

TI  == short term urinary catheterized patients in intensive care unit (icu)--a need to  screen.
AB  == catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the second most commonly reported healthcare associated infection, accounting for upto 40% of all nosocomial infections. silent catheter associated bacteriuria comprises a huge reservoir of resistant organism in hospitals particularly in critical care units. we prospectively studied 100 newly short-term catheterized patients in a tertiary care hospital. samples collected on day three and daily thereafter for semi quantitative urine culture and pus cell count. antibiotic sensitivity was tested  using kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. out of hundred patients, 32 showed growth on fifth day and remaining 68 samples were culture negative up to seventh  day. none of the culture positive samples had pus cells. escherichia coli (35%) was the predominant isolate followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, candida spp (15% each) and coagulase negative staphylococcus (5%). among the gram negative organisms, four strains of escherichia coli and two strains of klebsiella pneumonia were extended spectrum beta lactamases (esbl) producers and 33.3% were multidrug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. multidrug resistant pathogens in an asymptomatic short-term catheterized patient are a major reservoir in hospitals. this emphasizes the importance of periodic surveillance for nosocomial infections in hospital and the periodic screening will also help us to frame antibiotic policy in a new tertiary care hospital.

AB  == intravenous catheterization can lead to colonization as well as a broad spectrum  of infections ranging from catheter site infections to catheter-related blood stream infections (crbsis). the aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of causative agents and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in  crbsis and catheter site infections along with the colonization rates and colonizing microorganisms in zonguldak karaelmas university hospital, turkey. the results of cultures from catheter tips and/or intracatheter blood cultures and simultaneously taken peripheral blood cultures were sent to medical microbiology  laboratory and were retrospectively investigated for 201 patients hospitalized between september 2007 and september 2009. the catheter tips were cultured by semi-quantitative and quantitative culture methods. blood cultures from the catheters and peripheral veins were performed in bactec 9120 (becton dickinson, usa) blood culture systems. the antibiotic susceptibility tests were done by kirby-bauer disk diffusion method according to the guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). out of 201 patients included, 28 (13.9%) had crbsis and 13 (6.4%) had catheter site infections while colonization was defined for 55 (27.3%) patients. of 28 patients with crbsis, acinetobacter spp. were isolated from 11 including five carbapenem-resistant strains, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcns) from eight, methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (mscns) from two, klebsiella pneumoniae from two patients and one of each patient's cultures yielded methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), carbapenem-resistant  pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli and mrcns + enterococcus faecium. of 13 patients with catheter site infections, five mscns, two methicillin-susceptible s.aureus (mssa), two e.coli, and one of each k.pneumoniae, mrcns, enterococcus spp., k.pneumoniae + p.aeruginosa were isolated. no resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin were detected among the staphylococci isolated from crbsis and catheter site infections. the distribution of the 55 colonizing microorganisms were as follows; 18 mscns, 18 mrcns, four acinetobacter spp., five k.pneumoniae, three e.coli, two mssa, and one of each mrsa, p.mirabilis, p.aeruginosa, corynebacterium spp., candida albicans. in this  study, the predominant microorganism isolated from crbsis was acinetobacter spp., followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci. this unexpected distribution of the agents was related to the acinetobacter spp. that have gained endemic potential following an acinetobacter outbreak in our hospital in 2006. we emphasize that it is critical for any individual hospital to assess periodically the distribution and susceptibility profiles of isolates obtained from catheter-related infections to set out rational empirical treatment strategies.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from french teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  == the aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial  pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints. mics of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight french hospitals. disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (ca-sfm). the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by mic(50/90) (mics for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/l), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant cons, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; enterococcus faecalis,  0.25/1; enterococcus faecium, 64/128; enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. according to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for mics of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/l respectively. in conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many gram-positive bacteria, including mrsa but not e. faecium, whilst maintaining a gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.

TI  == microbiology of equine wounds and evidence of bacterial biofilms.
AB  == horse wounds have a high risk of becoming infected due to their environment. infected wounds harbour diverse populations of microorganisms, however in some cases these microorganisms can be difficult to identify and fail to respond to antibiotic treatment, resulting in chronic non-healing wounds. in human wounds this has been attributed to the ability of bacteria to survive in a biofilm phenotypic state. biofilms are known to delay wound healing, principally due to their recalcitrance towards antimicrobial therapies and components of the innate  immune response. this study describes the presence of bacterial biofilms within equine wounds. thirteen 8-mm diameter tissue samples were collected from (n=18) chronic wounds. following histological staining, samples were observed for evidence of biofilms. fifty one wounds and control skin sites were sampled using  sterile swabs. control skin sites were on the uninjured side of the horse at the  same anatomical location as the wound. the isolated bacteria were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. the biofilm forming potential of all the isolated  bacteria was determined using a standard crystal violet microtitre plate assay. stained tissue samples provided evidence of biofilms within 61.5% (8 out of 13) equine wounds. in total 340 bacterial isolates were identified from all the equine wound and skin samples. pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium were the most predominantly isolated bacterial species from equine wound and skin samples respectively. staphylococcus was the most commonly isolated genus in both environments. bacteria cultured from chronic and acute wounds showed significantly (p<0.05) higher biofilm forming potential than bacteria isolated from skin. this paper highlights preliminary evidence supporting the presence of  biofilms and a high microbial diversity in equine chronic wounds. the presence of biofilms in equine wounds partly explains the reluctance of many lower limb wounds to heal. non-healing limb wounds in horses are a well documented welfare and economic concern. this knowledge can be used to shape future treatments in order to increase the healing rate and decrease the costs and suffering associate with equine wounds.

TI  == immunological detection of uv induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts in dna from reference bacteria and natural aquatic populations.
AB  == uv light-caused dna damage is a widespread field of study. as uv light has the biological effect of inactivating or killing bacteria, it is used for water disinfection. due to this application, it is important to study the dna damage efficiencies and regeneration capacities in bacteria after uv irradiation. two monoclonal antibodies, anti-cpd and anti-(6-4) pp, were applied for an immunoassay of uv-induced dna modifications. cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (cpd) and 6-4 photoproduct (6-4 pp) were detected in the reference bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium, and in natural water communities. the antibody-mediated detection signals increased with the uv doses from 100-400j/m(2). here, the cpd-specific signals were stronger than the (6-4) pp-specific signals. these immunological results were in accordance with parallel cultivation experiments. all uv-irradiated bacteria showed a reduction of their growth rate depending on uv application by several orders of magnitudes. the immunoassay was also applied to three types of natural aquatic habitats with different cell densities. besides artificial uv irradiation, it was possible to visualize natural sunlight effects on these natural bacterial communities. light-dependent and dark repair processes were distinguished using the established immunological assays. the antibody-mediated analyses presented are fast methods to detect uv-induced dna lesions and repair capacities in selected bacterial species as well as in entire natural mixed populations.

TI  == progress and challenges in implementing the research on eskape pathogens.
AB  == the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance  to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. however, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. in addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. the difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research  in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to  identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.

TI  == medical-grade honey enriched with antimicrobial peptides has enhanced activity against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  == honey has potent activity against both antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria, and is an interesting agent for topical antimicrobial application to wounds. as honey is diluted by wound exudate, rapid bactericidal activity up to high dilution is a prerequisite for its successful application. we investigated the kinetics of the killing of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by rs honey, the source for the production of revamil(r) medical-grade honey, and we aimed to enhance the rapid bactericidal activity of rs honey by enrichment with its endogenous compounds or the addition of antimicrobial peptides (amps). rs honey killed antibiotic-resistant isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium, and burkholderia cepacia within 2 h, but lacked such rapid activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli. it was not feasible to enhance the rapid activity of rs honey by enrichment with endogenous  compounds, but rs honey enriched with 75 mum of the synthetic peptide bactericidal peptide 2 (bp2) showed rapid bactericidal activity against all species tested, including mrsa and esbl e. coli, at up to 10-20-fold dilution. rs honey enriched with bp2 rapidly killed all bacteria tested and had a broader spectrum of bactericidal activity than either bp2 or honey alone.

AB  == purpose: antimicrobial resistance monitoring could be a useful source of information for treating and controlling nosocomial infections. we analyzed antimicrobial resistance data generated by korean hospitals and by a commercial laboratory in 2005 and 2007. materials and methods: susceptibility data for 2005  and 2007 were collected from 37 and 41 hospitals, respectively, and from one commercial laboratory. intermediate susceptibility was not included in the calculation of resistance rates. results: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (64%), third-generation cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), fluoroquinolone-resistant escherichia coli (27%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (33%), and acinetobacter spp. (48%), and amikacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (19%) and acinetobacter spp. (37%) were prevalent in hospitals in 2007. a gradual increase of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. was observed. higher incidences of thirdgeneration cephalosporin-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae and imipenemresistant p. aeruginosa were found in the commercial laboratory than in the hospitals. conclusion: methicillin-resistant s. aureus, third-generation cephalosporin- resistant k. pneumoniae, and fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. remain prevalent in korea, while the incidence  of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. has  increased gradually. the higher prevalences of third-generation cephalosporinresistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa in the commercial laboratory are a new concern.

TI  == evaluation of the diversilab system for detection of hospital outbreaks of infections by different bacterial species.
AB  == many bacterial typing methods are specific for one species only, time-consuming,  or poorly reproducible. diversilab (dl; biomerieux) potentially overcomes these limitations. in this study, we evaluated the dl system for the identification of  hospital outbreaks of a number bacterial species. appropriately typed clinical isolates were tested with dl. dl typing agreed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) for acinetobacter (n = 26) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 13) isolates. with two exceptions, dl typing of klebsiella isolates (n = 23) also correlated with pfge, and in addition, pfge-nontypeable (pfge-nt) isolates could be typed. enterobacter (n = 28) results also correlated  with pfge results; also, pfge-nt isolates could be clustered. in a larger study (n = 270), a cluster of 30 isolates was observed that could be subdivided by pfge. the results for escherichia coli (n = 38) correlated less well with an experimental multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (mlva) scheme. pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 52) showed only a limited number of amplification products for most isolates. when multiple pseudomonas isolates were assigned to a single type in dl, all except one showed multiple multilocus sequence types. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus generally also showed a limited number of amplification products. isolates that belonged to different outbreaks by other typing methods, including pfge, spa typing, and mlva, were grouped together in a number of cases. for enterococcus faecium, the limited variability  of the amplification products obtained made interpretation difficult and correlation with mlva and esp gene typing was poor. all of the results are reflected in simpson's index of diversity and adjusted rand's and wallace's coefficients. dl is a useful tool to help identify hospital outbreaks of acinetobacter spp., s. maltophilia, the enterobacter cloacae complex, klebsiella  spp., and, to a somewhat lesser extent, e. coli. in our study, dl was inadequate  for p. aeruginosa, e. faecium, and mrsa. however, it should be noted that for the identification of outbreaks, epidemiological data should be combined with typing  results.

TI  == bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  == non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. the purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. overall, gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than gram-positive bacteria. for the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cenocepacia and escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the sa  78 and atcc 6538 strains, respectively. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. a rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with p. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive staphylococcus aureus  strain sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. a 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. a 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated p. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. a statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated  animals after the third day of the course. wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.

TI  == evaluation of pathogen detection from clinical samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction using a sepsis pathogen dna detection kit.
AB  == introduction: sepsis is a serious medical condition that requires rapidly administered, appropriate antibiotic treatment. conventional methods take three or more days for final pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. we organized a prospective observational multicenter study in three study sites to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and potential clinical utility of the septifast system, a multiplex pathogen detection system used in the clinical  setting to support early diagnosis of bloodstream infections. methods: a total of 212 patients, suspected of having systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs)  caused by bacterial or fungal infection, were enrolled in the study. from these patients, 407 blood samples were taken and blood culture analysis was performed to identify pathogens. whole blood was also collected for dna detection kit analysis immediately after its collection for blood culture. the results of the dna detection kit, blood culture and other culture tests were compared. the chosen antimicrobial treatment in patients whose samples tested positive in the dna detection kit and/or blood culture analysis was examined to evaluate the effect of concomitant antibiotic exposure on the results of these analyses. results: septifast analysis gave a positive result for 55 samples, while 43 samples were positive in blood culture analysis. the dna detection kit identified a pathogen in 11.3% (45/400) of the samples, compared to 8.0% (32/400) by blood culture analysis. twenty-three pathogens were detected by septifast only; conversely, this system missed five episodes of clinically significant bacteremia (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 2; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1; klebsiella spp, 1; enterococcus faecium, 1). the number of samples that tested positive was significantly increased by combining the result of the blood culture analysis with those of the dna detection kit analysis (p = 0.01). among antibiotic pre-treated patients (prevalence, 72%), septifast analysis detected more bacteria/fungi, and was less influenced by antibiotic exposure, compared with blood culture analysis (p = 0.02). conclusions: this rapid multiplex pathogen detection system complemented traditional culture-based methods and offered some added diagnostic value for the timely detection of causative pathogens, particularly in antibiotic pre-treated patients. adequately designed intervention studies are needed to prove its clinical effectiveness in improving  appropriate antibiotic selection and patient outcomes.

AB  == bacteria associated with marine sponges represent a rich source of bioactive metabolites. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize bacteria with  antimicrobial activities from brazilian sponges. a total of 158 colony-forming units were isolated from nine sponge species. among these, 12 isolates presented  antimicrobial activities against pathogenic bacteria. based on comparative sequence analysis of their 16s rrna genes, the sponge-associated bacterial strains could be subdivided into three phylogenetically different clusters. five  strains were affiliated with firmicutes (genera bacillus and virgibacillus), three with alpha-proteobacteria (pseudovibrio sp.) and four with gamma-proteobacteria (genera pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas). the sponge-associated bacterial strains pseudomonas fluorescens h40 and h41 and pseudomonas aeruginosa h51 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including strains such as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae. bacillus pumilus pc31 and pc32, pseudovibrio ascidiaceicola pm31 and  ca31 and pseudovibrio denitrificans mm37 strains were more effective against gram-positive bacteria. these findings suggest that the identified strains may contribute to the search for new sources of antimicrobial substances, an important strategy for developing alternative therapies to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == initial development and structure of biofilms on microbial fuel cell anodes.
AB  == background: microbial fuel cells (mfcs) rely on electrochemically active bacteria to capture the chemical energy contained in organics and convert it to electrical energy. bacteria develop biofilms on the mfc electrodes, allowing considerable conversion capacity and opportunities for extracellular electron transfer (eet).  the present knowledge on eet is centred around two gram-negative models, i.e. shewanella and geobacter species, as it is believed that gram-positives cannot perform eet by themselves as the gram-negatives can. to understand how bacteria form biofilms within mfcs and how their development, structure and viability affects electron transfer, we performed pure and co-culture experiments. results: biofilm viability was maintained highest nearer the anode during closed circuit operation (current flowing), in contrast to when the anode was in open circuit (soluble electron acceptor) where viability was highest on top of the biofilm, furthest from the anode. closed circuit anode pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were considerably thinner compared to the open circuit anode (30 +/- 3 microm and 42 +/- 3 microm respectively), which is likely due to the higher energetic gain of soluble electron acceptors used. the two gram-positive bacteria used only provided a fraction of current produced by the gram-negative organisms. power output of co-cultures gram-positive enterococcus faecium and either gram-negative organisms, increased by 30-70% relative to the single cultures. over time the co-culture biofilms segregated, in particular, pseudomonas aeruginosa creating towers piercing through a thin, uniform layer of enterococcus faecium. p. aeruginosa and e. faecium together generated a current of 1.8 +/- 0.4 ma while alone they produced 0.9 +/- 0.01 and 0.2 +/- 0.05 ma respectively. conclusion: we postulate that this segregation may be an essential difference in strategy for electron transfer and substrate capture between the gram-negative and the gram-positive bacteria used here.

AB  == with the rise in prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, honey is increasingly valued for its antibacterial activity. to characterize all bactericidal factors in a medical-grade honey, we used a novel approach of successive neutralization of individual honey bactericidal factors. all bacteria  tested, including bacillus subtilis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli, ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, were killed by 10-20% (v/v) honey, whereas > or = 40% (v/v) of a honey-equivalent sugar solution was required for similar activity. honey accumulated up to 5.62 +/- 0.54 mm h(2)o(2) and contained 0.25 +/- 0.01 mm methylglyoxal (mgo). after enzymatic neutralization of these two compounds, honey retained substantial activity. using b. subtilis for activity-guided isolation of the additional antimicrobial factors, we discovered bee defensin-1 in honey. after combined neutralization of h(2)o(2), mgo, and bee defensin-1, 20% honey had only minimal activity left, and subsequent adjustment of the ph of this honey from 3.3 to 7.0 reduced the activity to that of sugar alone. activity against all other bacteria tested depended on sugar, h(2)o(2), mgo, and bee defensin-1. thus, we fully characterized the antibacterial activity of medical-grade honey.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == [recent trend and research issues related to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria].
AB  == the discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. these discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. however, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. in this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.

TI  == new antibiotics: optimal use in current clinical practice.
AB  == the optimal choice of antibacterial therapy among the few available options for infections caused by pathogens with advanced antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to maximize clinical effectiveness and minimize the likelihood for further resistance development. we herein review the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotics introduced in clinical practice during the past 10 years for specific clinical indications. quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have increased the available therapeutic options against specific types of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections. the newer fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, along with the ketolide telithromycin and the oral third-generation cephalosporin cefditoren are particularly valuable for the treatment of specific types of multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae infections. tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for infections  caused by enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), or multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. ertapenem and doripenem may be particularly useful against infections caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.

TI  == [update on antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  == there is a constant need for new antibacterial agents because of the unavoidable  development of bacterial resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics  in clinical practice. as observed in many fields, innovation generally comes by series. for instance, a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents became available between the 1970s and the 1990s, such as cephalosporins, penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. over the last 2 decades, the arrival of new antibacterial drugs on the market has dramatically slowed, leaving a frequent gap between isolation of resistant pathogens and effective treatment options. in fact, many pharmaceutical companies focused on the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeted at multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria (e.g. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium). therefore, multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii) recently emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. even if some molecules were developed, new molecules for infections caused by these multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria remain remarkably scarce compared to those for gram-positive infections. this review summarises the major microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties of systemic antibiotics recently marketed in france (i.e. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, ertapenem, and doripenem) as well as those of antibacterial drugs currently in development (i.e. ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin, iclaprim, and ramoplanin) or available in other countries (i.e. garenoxacin, sitafloxacin, and temocillin).

TI  == benzoxazine series of histidine kinase inhibitors as potential antimicrobial agents with activity against enterococci.
AB  == background: antibacterial activity of three members of a benzoxazine series of histidine kinase inhibitors ( 4a , 4b and 6 ) was studied on standard strains, and with 4b also on clinical isolates of enterococci. methods: susceptibility to  each compound was tested using a broth macrodilution method with a range of dilutions from 0.016 to 128 microg/ml on four standard strains (escherichia coli  atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) and in the case of 4b also on 52 clinical isolates of enterococci (7 vancomycin-susceptible e. faecalis, 15 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium and 30 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium), and on two additional standard strains (s. aureus atcc 43300 and e. faecalis atcc 51299). results: neither of the compounds inhibited the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 or p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. compound 4b inhibited the growth  of s. aureus atcc 29213 at 8 microg/ml, s. aureus atcc 43300 at 32 microg/ml, e.  faecalis atcc 29212, and e. faecalis atcc 51299 at 16 microg/ml, while 4a and 6 did so at higher concentrations. for clinical isolates of enterococci, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 4b were in the range of 0.5-16 microg/ml. conclusions: compound 4b promises to be a potentially useful antimicrobial agent  for vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci.

TI  == [a sensitive, specific and predictive isolation medium developed for stenotrophomonas maltophilia study in healthcare settings].
AB  == background: stenotrophomonas maltophilia (smalto) is a prominent nosocomial pathogen, commonly isolated in the hospital environment. multiple smalto nosocomial outbreaks have been linked to contaminated water sources. this study aimed to develop a medium able to ease healthcare environment smalto isolation. methods: financed, from march 2007 to june 2008, by a university hospital of amiens' clinical research program, this study allowed stenotrophomonas maltophilia selective medium with coloured indicator (sm2i) development. sm2i is  constituted of mueller hinton agar (mh), maltose, dl-methionine, bromothymol blue. the mixture sterilized is refreshed at 50 degrees c, its ph adjusted to 7.1, and render selective by addition of vancomycin, imipenem and amphotericin b. then, sm2i agar is sunk into 90 cm diameter petri dish dated and stored at 4 degrees c for 4 weeks. sm2i is developed using pasteur institute culture type collection (cip) strains of smalto, burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa  (psa) and a smalto strain of our hygiene laboratory collection. it was validate on psa imipenem-resistant and enterococcus faecium vancomycin-resistant strains,  then, tested on cold water first jet and faucet cotton-swabs samples. sm2i tests  were made in comparison with the mh agar, mh agar plus four paper disks loaded 10 microg of imipenem and cetrimed agar. its sensitivity, specificity, positive (ppv) and negative (npv) predictive values, accuracy, likehood-ratio (lr) and youden index have been determined. results: sm2i agar is better in culturing smalto test-strains. on sm2i, smalto colonies are smooth, round, greeny, olive or lime green, have a green olive centre with a peripheral lighter or a dark green centre with an olive green suburb surrounded by a blue halo. sm2i is a selective, specific, predictive, accurate medium to search for smalto in healthcare environment. in 122 pairs of cold water first jet and taps cotton-swabs samples,  smalto was isolated from 14.8% of water samples, 10.7% of cotton-swabs samples. it was isolated alone in 6.6% of water samples and 2.5% of swab samples. thus, smalto has biocontaminated 17.2% of cold water taps. compared to mh agar, sm2i sensitivity, specificity, ppv, npv, accuracy, lr were 100, 100, 100, 100, 100% and infinity, and 87.5, 100, 100, 98.1, 98.4% and infinity for water and cotton-swabs samples respectively. conclusion: sm2i is a selective, specific, predictive medium which can allow easily isolating and identifying accurately smalto in environmental samples. its evaluation on clinical samples is on going.

TI  == c-reactive protein and interleukin-6 responses for differentiating fungal and bacterial aetiology in late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == fungal infections are increasingly frequent causes of neonatal sepsis (ns). this  study examined the predictive value of the combined evaluation of the c-reactive  protein (crp) and interleukin-6 (il-6) responses for differentiating fungal and bacterial aetiologies in patients with ns. from january to september 2007, neonates who were diagnosed with ns and had their crp and il-6 levels measured were selected. based on their blood culture results, the neonates were divided into two groups: group of fungal sepsis (fs) and group of bacterial sepsis (bs).  fs included 14 candida albicans and one non-albicans candida isolates and bs included five klebsiella pneumoniae, three pseudomonas aeruginosa, three enterococcus faecalis, two coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, one enterococcus faecium and one acinetobacter species. significant differences were  observed in the crp (fs vs. bs: 28.10 +/- 11.03 vs. 11.39 +/- 2.94 mg l(-1), p =  0.026) and il-6 (fs vs. bs: 38.60 +/- 24.24 vs. 392.82 +/- 102.46 ng l(-1), p = 0.000) levels between groups. the combined evaluation of the crp and il-6 responses better predicted the causative micro-organism in ns.

TI  == in vivo labeling and specific magnetic bead separation of rna for biofilm characterization and stress-induced gene expression analysis in bacteria.
AB  == the method of in vivo labeling and separation of bacterial rna was developed as an approach to elucidating the stress response of natural bacterial populations.  this technique is based on the incorporation of digoxigenin-11-uridine-5'-triphosphate (dig-11-utp) in the rna of active bacteria. the digoxigenin fulfills a dual role as a label of de novo synthesized  rna and a target for magnetic bead separation from a total rna extract. depending on the growth conditions and the population's composition, the assembly rate of dig-11-utp ranged from 1.2% to 12.5% of the total rna in gram-positive and gram-negative reference bacteria as well as in natural biofilms from drinking water, surface water, and lake sediment. separation of dig-rna from total rna extracts was performed with a biotinylated anti-digoxigenin antibody and streptavidin-functionalized magnetic particles. the average separation yield from total rna extracts was about 95% of labeled rna. the unspecific bindings of non-labeled nucleic acids were smaller than 0.2%, as was evaluated by spiking experiments with an unmarked dna amplicon. applicability of the method developed  was demonstrated by rrna-directed pcr-dgge population analysis of natural biofilms and expression profiling of two stress-induced genes (vana and rpos) in  reference bacteria.

TI  == is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  == objective: surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. these exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. the association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. design: prospective cohort study during 24 months. setting: eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. patients: all inpatients. interventions: none. measurements and main results: primary isolates  of six indicator organisms (acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant s. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. surveillance of nosocomial  infection rates was performed according to the german nosocomial infection surveillance system, krankenhaus infektions surveillance system. transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate spearman's rank-correlation test. during 100,781 patient days, 100,829  microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6  transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration  of hospitalization, or device use. conclusions: differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.

TI  == intestinal colonization with enterococcus faecium does not influence pulmonary defense against pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice.
AB  == background: enterococci, and especially multiresistant enterococcus faecium, are  increasingly found colonizing hospitalized patients. this increased prevalence of colonization is not only associated with an increased prevalence of infections caused by enterococci, but also by infections with other nosocomial pathogens. in this study we investigated the causality of this observed relationship, by determining the influence of intestinal colonization with e. faecium on pulmonary defense against pseudomonas aeruginosa. methodology/principal findings: three groups of mice were tested; 2 groups of mice were pre-treated with vancomycin, of which one group was subsequently treated by oral gavage of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (vre). the third group did not receive any pre-treatment. p. aeruginosa pneumonia was induced in all mice. vancomycin treatment resulted in intestinal gram-negative bacterial overgrowth and vre treatment resulted in colonization throughout the intestines. all 3 groups of mice were able to clear p. aeruginosa from the lungs and circulation, with comparable lung cytokine responses and lung damage. mice treated with vancomycin without vre colonization  displayed modestly increased plasma levels of tnf-alpha and il-10. conclusion: overgrowth of e. faecium and/or gram-negative bacteria does not impact importantly on pulmonary defense against p. aeruginosa pneumonia.

TI  == application of a molecular biology concept for the detection of dna damage and repair during uv disinfection.
AB  == as nucleic acids are major targets in bacteria during standardised uv disinfection (254 nm), inactivation rates also depend on bacterial dna repair. due to uv-related dna modifications, pcr-based approaches allow for a direct detection of dna damage and repair during uv disinfection. by applying different  primer sets, the correlation between amplicon length and pcr amplification became obvious. the longer the targeted dna fragment was, the more uv-induced dna lesions inhibited the pcr. regeneration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, and complex wastewater communities was recorded over a time period of 66 h. while phases of intensive repair and proliferation were found for p. aeruginosa, no dna repair was detected by qpcr in e. faecium. cultivation experiments verified these results. despite high uv mediated inactivation rates original wastewater bacteria seem to express an enhanced robustness against irradiation. regeneration of dominant and proliferation of low-abundant, probably uv-resistant species contributed to a strong post-irradiation recovery accompanied by a selection for beta-proteobacteria.

AB  == strain st44am, isolated from marula, was identified as pediococcus pentosaceus based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (api 50chl), pcr with species-specific primers and 16s rdna sequencing. strain st44am produces a 6.5 kda class iia bacteriocin, active against lactic acid bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, listeria innocua, listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and listeria monocytogenes. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, triton x-100, triton x-114, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea, nacl and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at  100 degrees c for 120 min or 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity against l. ivanovii susbp. ivanovii atcc19119 and enterococcus faecium hklhs is bactericidal, resulting in cell lyses and enzyme- and dna-leakage. no significant differences in cell growth and bacteriocin production were observed when strain st44am was cultured in mrs broth at 26 degrees c, 30 degrees c and 37 degrees c for 24 h and tested against the same target strain. l. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii atcc 19119 and e. faecium hklhs did, however, differ in sensitivity to bacteriocin st44am (3.3x10(6) au/ml and 2.6x10(4) au/ml, respectively). peptide st44am adsorbs at high levels (1600 au/ml) to producer cells. bacteriocin st44am  may be a derivative of pediocin pa-1. this is the first report on the presence of p. pentosaceus in marula and a pediocin pa-1 derivative produced by this species. we are also the first to report on the synergetic effect ciprofloxacin has on a pediocin-like bacteriocin.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of tigecycline and comparators against bacterial isolates collected as part of the test study in europe (2004-2007).
AB  == tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections. the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) is a global, longitudinal surveillance study established in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against key gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. this report examines data obtained for 24748 isolates collected across 24 european countries between 2004 and 2007. tigecycline, meropenem and imipenem were the most active antimicrobial agents against most gram-negative isolates including multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (15.7% of the a. baumannii isolates in this study), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (8.5% of e. coli) and esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (13.6% of k. pneumoniae). only amikacin was  active against >90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (92.8% susceptible). tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were the most active agents against gram-positive agents across europe between 2004 and 2007, with tigecycline displaying the lowest mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (26.5% of the collected s. aureus isolates), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (15.7% of the e. faecium strains) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (9.3% of the s. pneumoniae strains). longitudinal analysis showed no increase in  tigecycline mic values over the 4-year study period, whilst increased resistance  was noted for several comparator agents.

TI  == characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  == the present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a r. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. the bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium, and enterobacteriaceae (enterobacter spp., escherichia coli) while pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. the lactobacillus plantarum and l. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. while l. plantarum crl 1606 also inhibited  red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. however, by using a mrs medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. the surface properties of lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate abo human erythrocytes, while  the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. this  paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.

TI  == tigecycline in combination with other antimicrobials: a review of in vitro, animal and case report studies.
AB  == tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. in vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp. and brucella melitensis isolates. combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic acinetobacter baumannii and proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against k. pneumoniae. data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin  against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against k. pneumoniae bacteraemia and p. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.

TI  == blood stream infections in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: reemergence of gram-negative rods and increasing antibiotic resistance.
AB  == blood stream infections (bsi) are a well-known cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) patients. the aim of this study was  to analyze etiology and microbial resistance of bsi in patients undergoing allogeneic hsct in a single center over a 4-year period (2004-2007). there were 168 episodes of bsi in 132 patients (median 10 days after hsct) and 182 pathogens were isolated. gram-positive bacteria (gpb) accounted for 57% of 182 isolates. gram-negative rods (gnr) for 37% and fungi for 6%. all patients received routine  fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. there was a significant decrease in gpb/gnr ratio over time, from 2.4 in 2004 to 1 in 2007 (p = .043). among gpb, staphylococci decreased from 37 of 68 (64%) in 2004-2005 to 8 of 35 (23%) in 2006-2007 (p < .002). the enterococcus faecalis/e. faecium ratio decreased from 4.5 in 2004 to 0.33 in 2007 (p = .006), whereas the total number of enterococcal strains per year did not change. the incidence of escherichia coli among gnr increased from 3 of 15 (20%) in 2004 to 13 of 21 (62%) in 2007 (p = .003). fluoroquinolone-resistance was common, both among gpb and gnr (81% and 74%, respectively). mortality rate at 7 days after bsi was 11% (19 of 168), reaching 39% for pseudomonas aeruginosa bsi (7 of 18). bsi remains a frequent and potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic hsct, the causative organism influencing 7- and 30-day mortality rate. bsi etiology may change rapidly, requiring implementation of new empirical-therapy schemes.

TI  == monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  == the objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (btm), as well as to clarify the  relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc). the purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for btscc at the population level. samples of btm were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. counts of specific mammary pathogens in btm samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. significant differences were documented in btscc between btm samples containing str. agalactiae, staph. aureus, and str. dysgalactiae and btm samples that were pathogen-free. geometric means of btscc associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall btscc (str. agalactiae 243 628; staph. aureus  205 610; str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). it follows that the somatic cell count (scc) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall btscc. environmental pathogens predominated in samples of btm with scc <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in btm samples with scc >300x103/ml. no correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and btscc. this study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of btm in relation to btscc is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.

TI  == differential correlation between rates of antimicrobial drug consumption and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in a tertiary care hospital in greece.
AB  == objective: to investigate whether there is a correlation between the rates of antimicrobial drug consumption in hospital departments and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among clinically important bacteria recovered in the hospital. design: retrospective study. setting: tertiary care hospital in greece. methods: data on antimicrobial consumption (from january 2001 through december 2004) were expressed as defined daily doses per 100 bed-days. the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterococcus faecium recovered during the same time period were calculated by the microbiology department. we then performed the following analyses: (1) a comparison of the consumption rates for different antimicrobial groups in individual hospital departments, (2) a comparison of the prevalence of resistance to different antimicrobials, and (3) a correlation analysis of antimicrobial consumption rates and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. results: the rates of antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of resistance varied substantially among the hospital's departments. the annual rate of consumption for carbapenems  correlated with the rate of consumption for glycopeptides and third-generation cephalosporins (p < .05). among p. aeruginosa isolates, the prevalence of imipenem resistance correlated with the prevalence of resistance to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime (p < .05). the rate of carbapenem consumption correlated with the prevalence of imipenem resistance among p. aeruginosa and a.  baumannii isolates (p < .05). the rate of aminoglycoside consumption correlated with the prevalence of amikacin resistance among p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli isolates (p < .05). however, the rate of consumption for fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides had no correlation with the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance among gram-negative bacteria or vancomycin resistance among e. faecium isolates. conclusions: these data are suggestive of a differential relationship between antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among various species and for various antimicrobial agents. these findings may help to optimize antimicrobial prescription policies in the hospital, especially in departments that have both high rates of antimicrobial consumption and a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == the culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. data sources: literature identification was conducted through medline (1966-february 2008) and international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970-february 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, bal 5788, ro-5788, bal 9141, ro 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, mrsa, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssis), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. study selection and data extraction: all articles in english were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. data synthesis: ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecium. preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for csssis. ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive csssis, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial csssis (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. conclusions: the  activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful  as empiric monotherapy for csssi and in combination with other antimicrobials in  lower respiratory tract infections for which phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. approval is expected for the treatment of csssi.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
AB  == ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for  broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested  against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and  < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae,  beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at <  or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were  inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against  enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold  more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa  may be prevalent.

TI  == [microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
AB  == background: blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. methods: the species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the severance hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. results: of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by staphylococcus  aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, enterococcus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. the proportion of patients with enterococcus faecium and k. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. enterococcus, s. aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. e. coli, enterococcus spp., k. pneumoniae and s. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenemresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and  acinetobacter baumannii increased. conclusions: e. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and s. aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and k. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. the bacteremia due to enterococcus, k. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii gradually increased during this period.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in puerto rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (arm) program.
AB  == purpose: the antimicrobial resistance management program (armp) was established in 1997 at the university of florida as an ongoing project to document trends in  antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track  resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. methods: institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial  susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. the data, in a hipaa-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate  database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. this database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in puerto rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the state of florida and all u.s. institutions. results: between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout puerto rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 u.s. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/staphylococcus epidermidis (18), enterococcus faecalis (7), enterococcus faecium (5), enterococcus species (4), escherichia coli (24), klebsiella pneumoniae (24), proteus mirabilis (22), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), serratia marcescens (22), staphylococcus aureus (23), and streptococcus pneumoniae (9). antimicrobial resistance in puerto rico varied organism to organism from that observed in florida and nationally. conclusions: this first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in puerto rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.

TI  == endocarditis in burn patients: clinical and diagnostic considerations.
AB  == background: burned patients are at high risk for invasive procedures, bacteremia, and other infectious complications. previous publications describe high incidence, delayed diagnosis, and high mortality for endocarditis in burned patients, but do not address use of contemporary diagnostic criteria. further analysis of the clinical presentation and diagnosis may aid in the earlier recognition and decreased mortality of endocarditis in burned patients. methods:  at a 40 bed burn center, during the period from 1 january 2003 to 1 august 2006,  blood culture, electronic inpatient, echocardiographic, and autopsy records were  reviewed for cases of endocarditis and persistent bacteremia (blood culture positivity for the same organism separated by 24h). in addition, we reviewed cases of burn-related bacterial endocarditis published in the english language. we compared the clinical and diagnostic aspects of our identified cases with those in the published literature. results: there were 90 episodes of persistent  bacteremia or fungemia in 56 of 1250 patients admitted during the study period. echocardiography was performed on 19, identifying 4 cases of endocarditis. one additional case of endocarditis was identified post-mortem. time until echocardiography ranged from 6 to 176 days after onset of bacteremia. case patient age ranged from 31 to 64 years, and total burn surface area ranged from 34 to 80%. endocarditis occurred in 0.4% of burn unit admissions and in 8.9% of these patients with persistent bacteremia. sites involved included the mitral valve (3), tricuspid valve (2), aortic valve (1), and pulmonic valve (1). pathogens included staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one case of enterococcus faecium. diagnostic clues were minimal. case mortality was 100%. a literature review revealed 17 publications describing confirmed bacterial endocarditis in burned patients. these cases revealed a predilection for infection by s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, a relative paucity of diagnostic clues  prior to death, and a trend towards ante-mortem diagnosis and increased survival  with use of diagnostic echocardiography. conclusions: the incidence and mortality of endocarditis in burned patients remain high. clinical clues for endocarditis in this cohort are minimal and diagnosis may be delayed. for burned patients with persistent bacteremia, especially s. aureus or p. aeruginosa of unknown source, the diagnosis of endocarditis should be entertained and early echocardiography considered.

TI  == comparative analysis of the bactericidal activities of amphibian peptide analogues against multidrug-resistant nosocomial bacterial strains.
AB  == due to the widespread resistance of bacteria to the available drugs, the discovery of new classes of antibiotics is urgently needed, and naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (amps) are considered promising candidates for future therapeutic use. amphibian skin is one of the richest sources of such amps. in the present study we compared the in vitro bactericidal activities of five amps from three different species of anurans against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates belonging to species often involved in nosocomial infections (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter baumannii). the peptides tested were temporins a, b, and g from rana temporaria; the fragment from positions 1 to 18 of esculentin 1b [esc(1-18)] from rana esculenta; and bombinin h2 from bombina variegata. when they were tested in buffer, all the peptides were bactericidal against all bacterial species tested (three strains of each species) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 48 microm, with only a few exceptions. the temporins were found to be more active against gram-positive bacteria, especially when they were assayed in human serum; esc(1-18) showed fast and strong bactericidal activity, within 2 to 20 min, especially against the gram-negative species, which were killed by esc(1-18) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1 microm; bombinin h2 displayed similar bactericidal activity toward all isolates.  interestingly, while the activities of the temporins and bombinin h2 were almost  completely inhibited in the presence of 20% human serum, the activity of esc(1-18) against the gram-negative species was partially preserved in the presence of 40% serum. this property renders this peptide an attractive molecule  for use in the development of new compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates from urine cultures at an oncological center].
AB  == objective: to describe the patterns of antimicrobial resistance of organisms isolated from urine cultures at a teaching oncological hospital for adult patients. material and methods: all strains obtained from urine cultures from 1998 to 2005 were included. mean susceptibilities were obtained for each antimicrobial tested; nosocomial and community-acquired isolates were analyzed separately. results: a total of 9,232 positive urine cultures were obtained (20.7%) from 44,447 samples taken. gram negative bacteria were reported in 78.8%, gram-positive in 13.8% and yeasts in 7.4%. escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated bacterium (41.3%); antimicrobial resistance was higher in nosocomial isolates than in community strains (amikacin 92.4 vs. 97%, ceftazidime 83.1 vs. 95.1% and ciprofloxacin 46.2 vs. 58.6%). pseudomonas aeruginosa showed a greater resistance to amikacin and ceftazidime in nosocomial cultures compared to community-acquired bacterial cultures (55.7 vs. 66.6% and 65.5 vs. 84.8% respectively). vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in only 2.5% (3 of 119 e. faecium isolates). conclusions: higher bacterial resistance was observed in nosocomial cultures than in community ones. antimicrobial resistance was found to be progressively increasing for e. coli, the most frequent pathogen isolated both in nosocomial and community infections. we consider imperative the establishment  of an intense educational campaign for the use and control of antibiotics.

TI  == preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  == the aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. one hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. on the basis of these results,  80% alcohol, octenidine 0.1%, and chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro  model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. the results of  the questionnaire revealed that chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and octenidine by 7% of the dentists. using the in vitro model, with the exception of s. aureus, chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. in contrast, the treatment with octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. the 80% alcohol was more efficient. no growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. on the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be  preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or octenidine using an incubation time  of 15 min with ultrasonication.

TI  == in-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. it forms a stable inhibitory complex with staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). in recent studies of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, the ceftobiprole  mic(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/l). for mrsa, mic(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/l). mics for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/l. ceftobiprole is active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(90) = 4 mg/l), but not generally active against enterococcus faecium (mic(90) > 16 mg/l). ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. however, recent data show activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of  ceftazidime. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class a non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class c beta-lactamases. ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of ampc beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by ampc beta-lactamase. studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by mrsa, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. it was also efficacious in murine infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with mic values < or =2 mg/l. the broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of  suspected gram-negative and gram-positive infections, including those caused by mrsa.

TI  == comparative review of the carbapenems.
AB  == the carbapenems are beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with an exceptionally broad  spectrum of activity. older carbapenems, such as imipenem, were often susceptible to degradation by the enzyme dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) located in renal tubules  and required co-administration with a dhp-1 inhibitor such as cilastatin. later additions to the class such as meropenem, ertapenem and doripenem demonstrated increased stability to dhp-1 and are administered without a dhp-1 inhibitor. like all beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, carbapenems act by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). carbapenems are stable to most beta-lactamases including ampc beta-lactamases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. resistance to carbapenems  develops when bacteria acquire or develop structural changes within their pbps, when they acquire metallo-beta-lactamases that are capable of rapidly degrading carbapenems, or when changes in membrane permeability arise as a result of loss of specific outer membrane porins. carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem) possess broad-spectrum in vitro activity, which includes activity against many gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria; carbapenems lack activity against enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. compared with imipenem, meropenem and doripenem, the spectrum of activity of ertapenem is more limited primarily because it lacks  activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus spp. imipenem, meropenem and doripenem have in vivo half lives of approximately 1 hour, while ertapenem has a half-life of approximately 4 hours making it suitable for once-daily administration. as with other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the most important pharmacodynamic parameter predicting in vivo efficacy is the time that  the plasma drug concentration is maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (t>mic). imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem have been studied in comparative clinical trials establishing their efficacy in the treatment of a variety of infections including complicated intra-abdominal infections, skin and  skin structure infections, community-acquired pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections, meningitis (meropenem only) and febrile neutropenia. the current role for imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem in therapy remains for use in moderate to severe nosocomial and polymicrobial infections. the unique antimicrobial spectrum and pharmacokinetic properties of ertapenem make it more suited to treatment of community-acquired infections and outpatient  intravenous antimicrobial therapy than for the treatment of nosocomial infections. doripenem is a promising new carbapenem with similar properties to those of meropenem, although it appears to have more potent in vitro activity against p. aeruginosa than meropenem. clinical trials are required to establish the efficacy and safety of doripenem in moderate to severe infections, including  nosocomial infections.

AB  == faropenem medoxomil is a new orally administered penem antibiotic. its chiral tetrahydrofuran substituent at position c2 is responsible for its improved chemical stability and reduced cns effects, compared with imipenem. faropenem demonstrates broad-spectrum in vitro antimicrobial activity against many gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, and is resistant to hydrolysis by nearly all beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and ampc beta-lactamases. however, faropenem is not active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia. prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparative (not vs placebo) clinical trials of acute bacterial sinusitis (abs), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and uncomplicated skin and  skin structure infections (usssis) have demonstrated that faropenem medoxomil has equivalent efficacy and safety compared with cefuroxime, clarithromycin, azithromycin, amoxicillin, cefpodoxime and amoxicillin-clavulanate. the evidence  supports faropenem medoxomil as a promising new oral beta-lactam with proven efficacy and safety for the treatment of a variety of community-acquired infections. however, the us fda recently rejected faropenem for all four indications stating that the clinical trials in abs and aecb should have been performed versus a placebo. in the cap studies, the fda stated that they could not be certain of the validity of the study population actually having the disease and for usssi, the fda stated that only a single trial was not adequate evidence of efficacy for this indication.

AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two vira studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. methods: in february 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus  influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (365), pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and acinetobacter baumannii (92). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. susceptibility was determined with  a broth microdilution method. results: among the non-penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). among mrsa, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin mic of 4  microg/ml. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli was 12.1%. resistance of a. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). conclusion: these results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.

TI  == comparison of bactec plus blood culture media to bact/alert fa blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  == blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. this study compared the ability  of becton dickinson (sparks, md) bactec plus bottles and biomerieux (durham, nc)  bact/alert fa bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow.  each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. the organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 cfu/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. overall, the bact/alert fa system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the bactec plus system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. both systems performed well in the detection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. in the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover streptococcus pneumoniae. the ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. the results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the bact/alert system. for the bactec system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. under these simulated conditions, the bactec plus system was superior to the bact/alert fa system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.

TI  == high-level vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates associated with a  polymicrobial biofilm.
AB  == glycopeptides such as vancomycin are the treatment of choice for infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. this study describes the identification of high-level vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) isolates in a  polymicrobial biofilm within an indwelling nephrostomy tube in a patient in new york. s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, micrococcus species, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the biofilm. for vrsa isolates, vancomycin mics ranged from 32 to >128 microg/ml. vrsa isolates were also resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, penicillin, and tetracycline but remained susceptible to chloramphenicol, linezolid, rifampin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. the vana gene was localized to a plasmid of approximately 100 kb in vrsa and e. faecium isolates from the biofilm. plasmid analysis revealed that the vrsa isolate acquired the 100-kb e. faecium plasmid, which was then maintained without integration into the mrsa plasmid. the tetracycline resistance genes tet(u) and tet(s), not previously detected in s. aureus isolates, were identified in the vrsa isolates. additional resistance elements in the vrsa isolate included a multiresistance gene cluster, ermb-aade-sat4-apha-3, msra (macrolide efflux), and the bifunctional aminoglycoside resistance gene aac(6')-aph(2")-ia. multiple combinations of resistance genes among the various isolates of staphylococci and  enterococci, including vana, tet(s), and tet(u), illustrate the dynamic nature of gene acquisition and loss within and between bacterial species throughout the course of infection. the potential for interspecies transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes, including resistance to vancomycin, may be enhanced by the microenvironment of a biofilm.

TI  == high prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. in korea: a konsar program in 2004.
AB  == a nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in korea. in this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by konsar group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. in hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. the most prevalent species was staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals,  but escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. the proportions of enterococcus faecium to all isolates of enterococcus faecalis plus e. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. the mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals  were: oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant e. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). in conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant k. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp.  and p. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae,  and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.

TI  == evaluation of inhibition and cross-reaction effects on real-time pcr applied to the total dna of wastewater samples for the quantification of bacterial antibiotic resistance genes and taxon-specific targets.
AB  == in order to evaluate the applicability of six primer and probe sets for taqman real-time rcr on dna of wastewater samples, effects of the sample matrix and dna  background on target quantification were studied with respect to differences between functional genes and taxonomically used rdna targets. primer/probe assays for real-time pcr (taqman) designed to quantitatively detect the antibiotic resistance genes bla(vim), vana, ampc, meca, and taxon-specific 23s rdna sequences for pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium/faecalis were tested for their sensitivity and amplification robustness. the amplification of their gene targets in dna extracts of wastewater ("wastewater dna") and reference strains ("reference dna") was compared with their amplification in "model dna" which was composed of wastewater dna and reference dna. target detection was quantifiable along up to seven decimal orders of magnitude. for the detection of  the resistance genes bla(vim), vana, ampc, and meca as well as the enterococci directed pcr only weak or no inhibition due to the impurities or wastewater dna matrix were demonstrated for the applied target concentrations. the taxonomically applied detection system for the quantification of p. aeruginosa showed a limited performance. for the analysis of the amplification dynamics of possibly similar nucleotide sequences of organisms related to p. aeruginosa a sybr green assay was employed. competitive amplification of similar sequences was identified to be a major mechanism of reduced sensitivity. hence, the primers were modified for an optimised detection. with the resulting reduction of cross reactions an increased sensitivity was achieved for the detection and quantification of p. aeruginosa in wastewater dna.

TI  == uv-induced dark repair mechanisms in bacteria associated with drinking water.
AB  == caulobacter crescentus and aquabacterium commune, both isolated from drinking water, as well as environmental isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium were treated with different uv fluences to study their capacity to restore induced dna damages. here, the induction of a key mechanism of bacterial dark repair, the so-called reca system, was analysed. with newly designed probes, the specific reca mrna was detected by northern blot. additionally, the reca protein was measured by the western blot technique using a specific antibody. in drinking water bacteria as well as in opportunistic microorganisms, a specific induction of dark repair mechanisms was found even at  uv fluences higher than 400j/m(2), the german standard for uv disinfection. this  induction depended on the incubation time after uv treatment. nevertheless, the uv-induced reca expressions were found to differ in the bacteria under investigation.

TI  == antimicrobial disinfection effect of a laundering procedure for hospital textiles against various indicator bacteria and fungi using different substrates for simulating human excrements.
AB  == recent studies confirm the increase of nosocomial infections and microbial resistance. one of the possible causes is infected textiles due to inappropriate  laundering procedures. most slovenian laundries use thermal laundering procedures with high energy and water consumption to disinfect hospital textiles. in addition to this fact, there is an increasing number of hospital textiles composed of cotton/polyester blends that cannot endure high temperatures of thermal disinfection. on the other hand, decreasing the temperature of laundering procedures enhances the possibility of pathogenic microorganisms to survive the laundering procedure. in our research, we determined the antimicrobic laundering  effect by simulating a common laundering procedure for hospital textiles in the laboratory washing machine at different temperatures by the use of bioindicators. enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium terrae, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for determining the antibacterial laundering effect. candida albicans was used for determining the antifungal laundering effect. swine blood, artificial sweat, and swine fat were used as substrates for simulating human excrements and were inoculated together with the  chosen microorganisms onto cotton pieces to simulate real laundering conditions.  it was found that e. faecium, s. aureus, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa survived at 60 degrees c, but no microorganisms were found at 75 degrees c.

TI  == inactivation of influenza a virus by gentian violet (gv) and gv-dyed cotton cloth, and bactericidal activities of these agents.
AB  == recently we have heard warnings of an outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (h5n1). although, to prevent such infections we must prepare anti-viral drugs and type-specific vaccines against influenza, we need various simple and effective protection methods, such as the use of face masks for public health. also, in any consideration of bacterial infections, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp) also pose serious concerns which must be addressed. i examined the antiviral activity of gentian violet (gv) and gv-dyed cloth against the influenza a (h1n1) virus. time-kill studies were carried out, and the virus titer was determined based on the 50% tissue culture infective dose (tcid50). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of gv against bacteria were also determined, and the killing activities of the gv-dyed  cloth were judged from viable cell counts. gv immediately killed the influenza a  virus and this was confirmed by electron microscopy. moreover, cloth dyed with a  combination of gv and copper showed not only excellent antiviral activity but also prominent bactericidal activities.

TI  == the effect of temperature on the antimicrobial activity of optisol-gs.
AB  == purpose: to determine the survival of different bacteria inoculated in optisol-gs at refrigerated storage temperature (6 degrees c) and after subsequent warming to room temperature (19-22 degrees c). methods: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus  faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were chosen from stock clinical isolates for inclusion in the study. the first group consisted of  12 optisol-gs vials. the second group consisted of 12 optisol-gs vials containing corneas inappropriate for transplantation according to the eye bank association of america (ebaa) protocols. each group was inoculated with 3 concentrations of approximately 10, 10, and 10 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of each bacterial species and then refrigerated per ebaa protocol. after 48 hours of refrigeration, all vials were placed at room temperature (rt) and counts were performed at 48, 50 (2 hour rt), 54 (6 hour rt), 60 (12 hour rt), 72 (24 hour rt), and 96 (48 hour rt) hours. at 96 hours, the corneal tissue from 10 and 10 inocula were cultured.  all samples underwent serial dilution, spiral plating on blood agar plates, and incubation at 35 degrees c. viable colony counts were determined at 24 hours. results: except for the 10 cfu/ml inocula of p. aeruginosa, all isolates were viable after 48 hours of refrigeration. rapid bactericidal activity was observed  against p. aeruginosa after 2 hours at rt, with complete sterilization by 6 hours. the rate and extent of killing against s. aureus were influenced by the initial inoculum. bactericidal activity was achieved after 2 hours at rt with 10  cfu/ml of s. aureus versus 24 hours with the 10 inoculum. of note, bactericidal activity was not observed against s. pneumoniae and e. faecium following 24 hours of storage at rt. the presence of corneal tissue did not affect viable counts, with counts from corneal tissue cultures reflecting the counts seen from optisol-gs after 48 hours at rt. conclusions: the antimicrobial activity of optisol-gs was reduced at refrigerated temperature and enhanced at rt. bactericidal activity was not observed against e. faecium at either refrigerated  temperature or rt.

TI  == the anti-microbial activity of electrolysed oxidizing water against microorganisms relevant in veterinary medicine.
AB  == standards of the german association of veterinary medicine (dvg) for the evaluation of chemical disinfectants were used to assess the anti-microbial efficacy of electrolysed oxidizing water (eow). enterococcus faecium, mycobacterium avium subspecies avium, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans were exposed to anode eow (ph, 3.0+/-0.1; oxidation-reduction potential (orp), +1100+/-50 mv; free chlorine, 400+/-20 mg/l cl2) and combined eow (7:3 anode:cathode, v/v; ph, 8.3+/-0.1; orp,  930-950 mv; free chlorine, 271+/-20 mg/l cl2). in water of standardized hardness  (wsh), all bacterial strains were completely inactivated by a 30 min exposure to  maximum 10.0% anode eow (approximately 40.0 mg/l cl2) or 50.0% combined eow (approximately 135.5 mg/l cl2). the sensitivity ranking order for anode eow to the bacterial test strains was p. mirabilis>s. aureus>m. avium ssp. avium>e. faecium>p. aeruginosa. p. mirabilis and s. aureus decreased to undetectable levels after 5 min of exposure to 7.5% anode eow (approximately 30.0 mg/l cl2). candida albicans was completely inactivated by a 5-min exposure to 5.0% anode eow. both, anode and combined eow exhibited no anti-microbial activities in standardized nutrient broth or after addition of 20.0% bovine serum to the wsh. further research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of eow as a disinfectant under operating conditions in animal production facilities.

TI  == further increase of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. in korea: 2003 konsar surveillance.
AB  == monitoring temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance can provide useful information for the empirical selection of antimicrobial agents to treat infected patients and for the control of nosocomial infections. in this study, we analyzed antimicrobial resistance of clinically relevant bacteria in 2003 at korean hospitals and at a commercial laboratory. the following organism-antimicrobial agent resistance combinations were very prevalent: oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (68%), expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), and fluoroquinolone-resistant escherichia coli (33%), acinetobacter spp. (58%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (40%). moreover, gradual increases in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (20%), cefoxitin-resistant e. coli (10%) and k. pneumoniae (23%), and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (20%) and acinetobacter spp. (13%) were also observed. the resistance rates of acinetobacter spp. to most antimicrobial agents at hospitals and at the commercial laboratory were similar. among the acinetobacter spp. isolated at a tertiary-care hospital, 46.2% were multidrug-resistant to 9-12 of 13 antimicrobial agents, and 18.3% were panresistant. the exclusion of duplicate isolates at a tertiary-care hospital significantly lowered the proportion of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli.

TI  == susceptibility studies of piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == susceptibility testing was used to evaluate potential spectrum of action for piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and to evaluate dimers against fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci. individual dimers displayed  equivalent or lowered mic values compared with parent fluoroquinolone monomers against test strains of s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, e. coli, and vre. raised mic  values were observed for all dimers in comparison to monomers against test strains of p. aeruginosa and e. coli. in comparison to parent fluoroquinolones, all dimers displayed decreased percent inhibition of growth against m. tuberculosis. structural requirements for activity of dimers and partial dimers against all organisms, including lower mics against certain fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci, were consistent with requirements previously observed for dimers against fluoroquinolone-susceptible and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of s. aureus. in contrast, the 10- to 100-fold lowering of mics against wild-type and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of s. aureus previously observed for individual cross-linked dimers was not observed with test strains of the various organisms used here.

TI  == bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound t cell depletion.
AB  == background: alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against cd52, a cell surface antigen expressed on b and t lymphocytes, monocytes and nk cells.  its use results in a profound decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. we followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. patients and methods: fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. however, no patient had bacteremia with streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal salmonella or mycobacterium avium complex. fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. the most common organisms isolated from the blood  were staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative staphylococcus (14 episodes), klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and escherichia coli (7 episodes). discussion: we conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound cd4 positive t lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of cd4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

TI  == trends in antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens and effect on treatment.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens is a growing concern for health care and for public health. a recent shift in the epidemiological profile of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus has resulted not only in health care-associated infections but now, also, in community-associated infections. reports have described s. aureus exhibiting decreased susceptibility  and, even, resistance to vancomycin. the rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci may be leveling; however, vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium has already achieved high levels. multidrug resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa is increasing, and carbapenem-resistant klebsiella strains are emerging. acinetobacter species cause a minority of health care-associated pneumonias due to gram-negative organisms, but a growing proportion is resistant  to carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins. recent increases in the frequency and severity of clostridium difficile-associated illness are associated with the emergence of a hypervirulent c. difficile strain with increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones. the presence of these and other resistant organisms in health care facilities limits the number of effective antimicrobials available for treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem (s-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  == the spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to  be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; mic90s 0.06 mg/l), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of enterococcus faecium,  doripenem displayed modest activity (mic50 4). doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; mic(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). for enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (mic90s 0.03-0.5 mg/l). mic90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155  isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. doripenem was also active against citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. (mic90s 0.06-0.25 mg/l), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/l, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/l, respectively). doripenem was slightly more potent (mic50 2 mg/l) than ertapenem and imipenem (mic50 4 mg/l), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (mic50 2 mg/l), against burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). both haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and moraxella catarrhalis  (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (mic90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.

TI  == correlation between the genetic diversity of nosocomial pathogens and their survival time in intensive care units.
AB  == bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the hospital environment outside the human host. species remaining viable and infectious have a higher chance of being transmitted, giving them a fitness advantage in hospitals. this differential fitness could be expected to alter the genetic population structure  of bacterial populations in hospitals, and should be reflected by the relative abundance of several successful clones. the objective of this study was to test for a potential correlation between tenacity, i.e. environmental survival, and clonal abundance determined by the genetic diversity in different bacterial species from prospectively collected isolates of intensive care patients. a literature review was performed to identify mean environmental survival times for the most important pathogens in intensive care units (icus): staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, acetinobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. to determine the genetic diversity of the natural population of these species in icus, a prospective 18-month study was conducted in five units with median nosocomial infection rates. all clinical isolates were collected, and highly discriminatory dna fingerprinting techniques were used to identify specific clones. a diversity index for each species was calculated as the number  of distinguishable genotypes in the population divided by size. the correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was investigated using non-parametric methods. although 21 studies were identified in the literature, only two were relevant. they showed median survival times between 1.5 days (p. aeruginosa) and 60.0 days (enterococcus faecium). during the prospective icu study, 1264 pathogens were investigated and simple diversity indices between 49.1 (enterococcus faecalis) and 89.8 (e. coli) were found. a correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was found (correlation coefficient 0.821, p=0.024). environmental survival may be an important factor contributing to the ecological fitness of some nosocomial pathogens in icus. infection control measures should consider this finding.

AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was  comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella  catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced  infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising  candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates from the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program, 2004).
AB  == tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. to determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program) commenced in 2003. this study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. tigecycline was the most active agent tested against gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. mic90 results (microg/ml) for tigecycline against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. tigecycline was active against enterobacteriaceae with an mic90 of 1 microg/ml. haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an mic90 of only 0.25 microg/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the  least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. tigecycline appears to be  a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens  with varying resistance phenotypes.

TI  == acquisition of resistant bowel flora during a double-blind randomized clinical trial of ertapenem versus piperacillin-tazobactam therapy for intraabdominal infections.
AB  == bowel colonization with resistant bacteria can develop in patients receiving broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. we compared the impact of two antimicrobial regimens often used to treat intraabdominal infections on susceptibility patterns of bowel flora at the end of therapy. in a double-blind clinical trial, adults with complicated intraabdominal infection requiring surgery were randomized to receive piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h) or ertapenem (1 g once a day) for 4 to 14 days. rectal swabs were obtained at baseline and at the end of study  therapy to determine the acquisition rates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to the study drug, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli or klebsiella species, pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem or piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. treated patients were assessable for the acquisition of resistant bacteria if appropriate specimens were obtained at both time points. enterobacteriaceae resistant to the treatment received were acquired during study therapy by 8/122 assessable piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (6.6%) compared to 0/122 assessable ertapenem recipients (p = 0.007). neither esbl-producing e. coli or klebsiella species nor p. aeruginosa resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam was  isolated from patients in either treatment group. imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa was acquired by two of the ertapenem recipients (1.6%) versus zero of  the piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (p = 0.50). vancomycin-resistant enterococci were acquired during therapy by 8/125 assessable ertapenem recipients (6.4%) versus 2/123 assessable piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (1.6%; p = 0.10). in this study, the acquisition of resistant enterobacteriaceae occurred significantly more often in patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam than in those treated with ertapenem.

TI  == characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

TI  == evaluation of negative results of bact/alert 3d automated blood culture system.
AB  == although automated continuous-monitoring blood culture systems are both rapid and sensitive, false-positive and false-negative results still occur. the objective of this study, then, was to evaluate negative results occurring with bact/alert 3d blood culture systems. a total of 1032 samples were cultured with the bact/alert 3d automated blood culture system, using both aerobic (fa) and anaerobic (fn) [corrected] media, and 128 of these samples yielded positive results. a total of 904 negative blood samples were then subcultured in 5% sheep  blood agar, eosin methylene blue, chocolate agar, and sabouraud-dextrose agar. organisms growing on these subcultures were subsequently identified using both vitek32 (biomerieux, durham, nc) and conventional methods. twenty four (2.6%) of  the 904 subcultures grew on the subculture media. the majority (83.3%) of these were determined to be gram-positive microorganisms. fourteen (58.3%) were coagulase-negative staphylococci, two (8.3%) were bacillus spp., one (4.2%) was staphylococcus aureus, and one (4.2%) was identified as enterococcus faecium. streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria spp. were isolated together in two (8.3%)  vials. gram-negative microorganisms comprised 12.5% of the subcultures, of which  two (8.3%) were found to be pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one (4.2%) was pseudomonas fluorescens. the other isolate (4.2%) was identified as candida albicans. we conclude that the subculture of negative results is valuable in the  bact/alert 3d system, especially in situations in which only one set of blood cultures is taken.

TI  == bloodstream infection after umbilical cord blood transplantation using reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation for adult patients.
AB  == bloodstream infection (bsi) is a significant problem after cord blood transplantation (cbt). however, little information has been reported on bsi after reduced-intensity cbt (ri-cbt). we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 102 patients. the median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 17-79 years). preparative regimens comprised fludarabine 125 to 150 mg/m 2 , melphalan  80 to 140 mg/m 2 , or busulfan 8 mg/kg and total body irradiation 2 to 8 gy. prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease comprised cyclosporin or tacrolimus. bsi developed within 100 days of ri-cbt in 32 patients. the cumulative incidence of bsi was 25% at day 30 and 32% at day 100. the median onset was day 15 (range, 1-98 days). causative organisms included pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 11), staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), enterococcus faecium (n = 4), enterococcus faecalis (n = 4), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 4), and others (n = 7). of the 32 patients with bsi, 25 (84%) died within 100 days after ri-cbt. bsi was the direct cause of death in 8 patients (25%). univariate analysis failed to identify any significant risk factors. bsi clearly represents a significant and fatal complication after ri-cbt. further studies are warranted to determine clinical characteristics, identify patients at high risk of bsi, and establish therapeutic strategies.

TI  == human defensins.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi. the eukaryotic  antimicrobial peptides may be divided into four distinct groups according to their structural features: cysteine-free alpha-helices, extended cysteine-free alpha-helices with a predominance of one or two amino acids, loop structures with one intramolecular disulfide bond, and beta-sheet structures which are stabilised by two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds. mammalian defensins are part of the last-mentioned group. the mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their structural differences: the alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and the recently described theta-defensins. mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal paneth cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. recently, two novel human beta-defensins, human  beta-defensin-3 (hbd-3), and human beta-defensin-4 (hbd-4) have been discovered.  similar to hbd-1 and hbd-2, hbd-3 has microbicidal activity towards the gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli) and the yeasts  candida albicans and malassezia furfur. in addition, hbd-3 kills gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus pyogenes or staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant s. aureus strains, and even vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. in contrast to hbd-1 and hbd-2, significant expression of hbd-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues, such as leukocytes, heart and skeletal muscle. hbd-4 is expressed in certain epithelia and in neutrophils. its bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa is stronger than that of the other known beta-defensins. here we present an overview of human antimicrobial peptides with some emphasis on their antifungal properties.

TI  == survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  == in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee  for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and  an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == usnic acid, a natural antimicrobial agent able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on polymer surfaces.
AB  == in modern medicine, artificial devices are used for repair or replacement of damaged parts of the body, delivery of drugs, and monitoring the status of critically ill patients. however, artificial surfaces are often susceptible to colonization by bacteria and fungi. once microorganisms have adhered to the surface, they can form biofilms, resulting in highly resistant local or systemic  infections. at this time, the evidence suggests that (+)-usnic acid, a secondary  lichen metabolite, possesses antimicrobial activity against a number of planktonic gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus  faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. since lichens are surface-attached communities that produce antibiotics, including usnic acid, to protect themselves from colonization by other bacteria, we hypothesized that the mode of action of usnic acid may be utilized in the control of medical biofilms. we loaded (+)-usnic acid into modified polyurethane and quantitatively assessed the capacity of (+)-usnic acid to control biofilm formation by either s. aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa under laminar flow conditions by using image analysis. (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymers did not inhibit the initial attachment of s. aureus cells, but killing the attached cells resulted in the inhibition of biofilm. interestingly, although p. aeruginosa biofilms did form on the surface of (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymer, the morphology of the biofilm was altered, possibly indicating that (+)-usnic acid interfered with signaling pathways.

TI  == in vitro testing of antimicrobial activity of bone cement.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to establish a reliable and cost-effective microplate proliferation assay for in vitro antimicrobial testing of bone cement  samples. cement samples devoid of antimicrobial agents, loaded with 2% gentamicin or with different concentrations of high-porosity silver, were incubated in a 96-well microplate with several staphylococcal, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecium isolates exhibiting different susceptibilities to gentamicin. after being rinsed, the samples were brought into a soy medium in which adherent cells on the cement surface either were killed by the antimicrobial surface or started to release clonal counterparts. the medium was monitored in real time by recording a time proliferation curve for each well. microplate testing revealed no antibacterial effect of plain bone cement. the antibacterial activity of gentamicin-loaded bone cement was shown by the microplate test to depend on the gentamicin susceptibilities of the strains. the  effect of high-porosity silver was dose dependent. bactericidal activity against  all tested strains was found for bone cement loaded with 1% high-porosity silver. the accuracy of this new proliferation assay was shown by the high correlation between the types of proliferation curves and antibiotic susceptibility. in contrast to routine agar diffusion testing, it assesses the dynamic response of microorganisms to antimicrobial agents in biomaterials and allows high-throughput screening and detection of antimicrobial properties of poorly water-soluble compounds like silver.

AB  == objectives: to investigate the potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem  characterized by a wider spectrum of activity combining antimicrobial and bactericidal features of imipenem and meropenem. methods: this parenteral compound was studied against recent clinical isolates (2001-2002) from a worldwide organism collection. a total of 902 strains were susceptibility tested  by reference methods against doripenem and six to 28 comparators including ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem. the organisms tested included: enterobacteriaceae (281 strains), acinetobacter spp. (33), pseudomonas aeruginosa (35), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36), other non-fermenters (22), haemophilus influenzae (61), moraxella catarrhalis (33), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci  (39), enterococci (84), streptococci (163), various anaerobes (98), and other gram-positive species such as corynebacterium and bacillus spp. (17). results: against enterobacteriaceae, the average doripenem mic90 was 0.03 mg/l (range, < or =0.015-0.25 mg/l). doripenem was two- to 16-fold more potent than imipenem and comparable to ertapenem and meropenem; all doripenem mic values with enteric bacilli were < or =4 mg/l. doripenem was active against aeromonas (mic50, 0.03 mg/l), bacillus spp. (mic50, 0.03 mg/l) and all tested anaerobic species (mic range, < or =0.015-4 mg/l), but was less active against s. maltophilia (mic90, >32 mg/l) and enterococcus faecium (mic90, >32 mg/l) among the enterococcal species. time-dependent bactericidal action was observed for doripenem and broth  mic results were slightly greater when compared to agar mic results. in pilot testing, the optimal doripenem disc concentration was 10 microg, identical to standardized reagents for other clinically available carbapenems. conclusions: doripenem appears to be a potent carbapenem with a spectrum resembling currently  marketed antipseudomonal carbapenems, but with greater activity when tested against some non-fermentative bacillary strains. continued evaluation of doripenem against isolates resistant to other beta-lactams appears to be warranted.

TI  == in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial-coated vascular grafts.
AB  == the serious medical consequences and costly management of infections associated with vascular grafts have prompted an expanding interest in examining the preventive efficacy of antimicrobial-coated vascular grafts. the purpose of antimicrobial coating of vascular grafts is to reduce bacterial colonization of the device and, hopefully, the occurrence of clinical infection. in this study we demonstrated that expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts coated with minocycline and rifampin provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro,  as reflected by zones of inhibition, against staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus faecium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we also showed in a rabbit model that subcutaneously placed minocycline/rifampin-coated vascular grafts have lower rates of staphylococcal device colonization (1/24 = 4% vs. 8/30 = 27%, p = 0.033) and device-related infection (0/24 = 0% vs. 6/30 = 20%, p = 0.028) than uncoated grafts. these promising results encourage the clinical evaluation of vascular grafts coated with minocycline and rifampin.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland 2001-2002: the bsac bacteraemia resistance surveillance programme.
AB  == objectives: to describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. methods: in 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the uk and ireland. a single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured mics by the bsac agar dilution method. results: oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group b isolates (82% resistant). nine  percent of s. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l), but none required >/=2 mg/l for inhibition. high-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin mics (>/=32 mg/l), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of enterococcus faecium. vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of e. faecium, 3% of e. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, mic of 8 mg/l). escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of e. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of klebsiella spp. and 8% of enterobacter spp. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in gram-positive organisms. ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. mics of tigecycline were low for gram-positive species and enterobacteriaceae except proteeae and enterobacter spp. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. an important exception was oxacillin resistance in s. aureus.

TI  == antimicrobial activity in methanolic extracts of several plant species from northern argentina.
AB  == thirty-nine native plant species were collected from the provinces of chaco and formosa, in northern argentina, and were screened for antimicrobial activity. the plants were dried and extracted thoroughly with methanol. the dry extracts, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, were tested for inhibition of microbial growth via microplate assay with an oxidation-reduction dye. the test organisms were: escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. inhibition of respiratory activities in some of these microbial species was produced by the extracts of astronium balansae, geoffroea decorticans, peltophorum dubium, geoffroea spinosa, lantana balansae, prosopis kuntzei, prosopis ruscifolia and bulnesia sarmientoi, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 0.08 to 0.5 mg dry matter/ml. further in vitro experiments measuring the growth of s. aureus in liquid culture confirmed that all of the above extracts at 2 x mic were able to inhibit bacterial growth effectively, and that some of them (a.  balansae, g. decorticans, p. dubium, g. spinosa, p. kuntzei and b. sarmientoi) were able to reduce the initial number of viable counts by at least one order of  magnitude in 10 hours, indicating that these extracts should be investigated further for the possible presence of bactericidal components.

TI  == algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time lightcycler polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  == we developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including staphylococcus spp., s. epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of e. faecalis and e. faecium), streptococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, enterobacteriaceae, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., bacteroides spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. a total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific pcr algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the pcr results were compared to the culture results. apart from-cross reactions between e. coli and chryseomonas luteola and enterococcus faecium and e. durans, the pcr assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the pcr algorithm within a few hours. however, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. the pcr algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in  positive blood cultures.

TI  == [nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
AB  == the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this  drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria  were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of  glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities  of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we  conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.

TI  == high antibiotic susceptibility among bacterial pathogens in swedish icus. report  from a nation-wide surveillance program using ta90 as a novel index of susceptibility.
AB  == local infection control measures, antibiotic consumption and patient demographics from 1999-2000 together with bacteriological analyses were investigated in 29 icus participating in the icu-strama programme. the median antibiotic consumption per icu was 1147 (range 605-2143) daily doses per 1000 occupied bed d (ddd1000).  antibiotics to which > 90% of isolates of an organism were susceptible were defined as treatment alternatives (ta90). the mean number of ta90 was low (1-2 per organism) for enterococcus faecium (vancomycin:van), coagulase negative staphylococci (van), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ceftazidime:ctz, netilmicin: net) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (ctz, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: tsu), but higher (3-7) for acinetobacter spp. (imipenem:imi, net, tsu), enterococcus faecalis (ampicillin:amp, imi, van), serratia spp. (ciprofloxacin:cip, imi, net), enterobacter spp. (cip, imi, net, tsu), e. coli (cefuroxime:cxm, cefotaxime/eftazidime:ctx/ctz, cip, imi, net, piperacillin-tazobactam:ptz, tsu),  klebsiella spp. (ctx/ctz cip, imi, net, ptz, tsu) and staphylococcus aureus (clindamycin, fusidic acid, net, oxacillin, rifampicin, van). of s. aureus isolates 2% were mrsa. facilities for alcohol hand disinfection at each bed were  available in 96% of the icus. the numbers of ta90 available were apparently higher than in icus in southern europe and the us, despite a relatively high antibiotic consumption. this may be due to a moderate ecological impact of the used agents and the infection control routines in swedish icus.

TI  == increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in korea: konsar study in 2001.
AB  == the 5th year konsar surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. it was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. resistance rates of gram-positive cocci were: 70% of staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. seventy-two percent of pneumococci were  nonsusceptible to penicillin. the resistance rates of enterobacteriaceae were: escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. with the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.

AB  == a survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 japanese medical institutions in 2000. a total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. a high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecium. isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa from uti accounted for 30-60%.  however, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, moraxella catarrhalis,  the enterobacteriaceae family, and haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). about 85% of p. aeruginosa isolated from rti were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among mrsa, enterococci, and p. aeruginosa isolated from uti, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and p. aeruginosa from rti as has been demonstrated in previous studies.

TI  == bacteraemia in hospitalised patients with malignant blood disorders: a retrospective study of causative agents and their resistance profiles during a 14-year period without antibacterial prophylaxis.
AB  == bacteraemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological disorders during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. the generally reported trend during the last two decades has been a gradual replacement of gram-negative bacilli by gram-positive cocci as the major causes of bacteraemia in neutropenic hosts. however, data that are unaffected by the use of antibacterial prophylaxis are scarce. our objective therefore was to study the incidence of bacteraemia with different microorganisms in a haematology centre where antibacterial prophylaxis has not been used during the years 1988-2001. a total of 1402 episodes of clinically significant bacteraemia in 927 patients were identified. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and had an underlying haematological disorder, with lymphoma, leukaemia, and myeloma dominating. there were 536 (58%) male, and 391 (42%) female patients, with a median age of 58 years. the dominating pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) 17%, escherichia coli 16%, alpha-haemolytic streptococci 12%, staphylococcus aureus 9%, klebsiella spp 9%, enterococcus spp 7%, and pseudomonas spp 5%. the only significant incidence change was an increase of e. faecium bacteraemia. the balance between gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms was essentially stable over the 14-year period. the rates of antibiotic resistance were generally low and stable. gram-negative bacteria exhibited resistance to fluoroquinolones after 1998. the 7- and 30-day mortality rates were 6.3 and 15.6%, respectively, being significantly higher in patients with bacteraemia caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, or e. faecium.

TI  == a standardized test to assess the impact of different organic challenges on the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics.
AB  == this paper presents a suggestion for determining the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics in a phase 2/step 1 assay. emphasis is placed on specific organic challenges to evaluate the efficacy of antiseptics used to rinse the oral cavity, mucous membranes, or wounds for either prophylactic or therapeutic reasons. basic data are given concerning ready-to-use products based on poly(1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone-)iodine-complex (pvp-iodine), chlorhexidine, octenidine, or cetylpyridinium chloride. hydrogen peroxide (3.0%) was included to assess a product with known limited efficacy only. using staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, and candida albicans, a 10(5)-fold reduction can be achieved in 10 min without interfering substances. in the presence of 10% albumin, 10% sheep blood, or 1% mucin, a 10(3)-fold reduction is yielded using products based on pvp-iodine, octenidine, or chlorhexidine. the combination of 4.5% albumin, 4.5% sheep blood, and 1% mucin was the most difficult organic challenge and only the products based on pvp-iodine, octenidine, or chlorhexidine remained active. the cetylpyridinium-based product and hydrogen peroxide were less effective. based on these data, a proposal for a phase 2/step 1 assay for antiseptics is presented to promote the standardization efforts.

TI  == prepared endotracheal tubes: are they a potential source for pathogenic microorganisms?
AB  == prepared endotracheal tubes (petts) are frequently used for unanticipated difficult intubation, but their storage time is highly variable and institution-dependent. we sought to determine first, if open, unused petts are a  potential source of pathogenic microorganisms, and second, if petts can provide a medium for bacterial survival after deliberate contamination. a stylet was inserted into a 7-mm ett, and this system was ethylene oxide sterilized. the petts were placed in 20 different locations and sampled 8 times in a 4-wk period. growth was determined after 48-h incubation, and the microorganism was identified. in phase 2, the pett (n = 40) was swabbed with a fresh suspension of  h. influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, or a negative control. nonvirulent bacteria were cultured from 13 of 160 (8.1%) samples and from 15 of 320 (4.7%) samples in phases 1 and 2, respectively. no pett grew the same bacteria more than once. in phase 2, after 24 h, only e. faecium was recovered. based on this study, the pathogenic potential of petts is  very small, and they can be safely used for up to 1 mo. this practice could translate to significant cost reduction for operating room budgets. implications: prepared endotracheal tubes (petts) are back-up airway equipment to be used in the case of a difficult intubation. a short pett shelf life because of unknown safe storage time results in significant budget costs. this blinded, controlled study examined the pathogenic potential of petts in the operating room environment.

TI  == many chemokines including ccl20/mip-3alpha display antimicrobial activity.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that beta-defensins exhibit chemotactic activity by sharing the chemokine receptor ccr6 with the cc chemokine ligand ccl20/macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha (mip-3alpha). structural analysis of ccl20/mip-3alpha revealed that most of the positively charged residues are concentrated at one area of its topological surface, a characteristic considered  to be important for the antimicrobial activity of defensins. here, we report that similar to defensins, ccl20/mip-3alpha has antimicrobial effects on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. additionally,  by screening a total of 30 human chemokines, we have identified an additional 17  human chemokines, which exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro. collectively, about two-thirds of the chemokines investigated so far has the capacity to kill microorganisms in vitro, suggesting that antimicrobial activity may be another host-defense function for certain chemokines. comparison of the structural characteristics between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial chemokines suggests that topological formation of a large, positively charged electrostatic patch on  the surface of the molecule is likely to be a common structural feature of antimicrobial chemokines.

AB  == human beta-defensin 3 (hbd3) is a highly basic 45-amino-acid protein that acts both as an antimicrobial agent and as a chemoattractant molecule. although the nature of its antimicrobial activity is largely electrostatic, the importance of  the molecular structure on this activity is poorly understood. two isoforms of hbd3 were synthesized: the first with native disulfide linkages and the second with nonnative linkages. in a third synthetic peptide, all cysteine residues were replaced with alpha-aminobutyric acid, creating a completely linear peptide. a series of six small, linear peptides corresponding to regions of hbd3 with net charges ranging from +4 to +8 (at ph 7) and lengths ranging from 9 to 20 amino acids were also synthesized. the linear full-length peptide showed the highest microbicidal activity against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, while all three full-length forms showed equal activity against candida albicans. the linear peptide also showed high activity against enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. peptides corresponding to the c terminus showed higher activities when tested against e. coli, with the most active peptides being the most basic. however, only the peptide corresponding to the n terminus of hbd3 showed any activity against s. aureus and c. albicans. further, n-terminal deletion mutants of native hbd3 showed diminished activities against s. aureus. thus, the antimicrobial properties of hbd3 derivatives are determined by both charge and structure.

TI  == nosocomial bloodstream infections in pediatric patients in united states hospitals: epidemiology, clinical features and susceptibilities.
AB  == background: we identified the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of nosocomial bloodstream isolates in pediatric patients in the  us prospective surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals during a 6-year period [surveillance and control of pathogens of epidemiologic importance (scope)] detected 22 609 bloodstream infections, of which 3432 occurred in patients < or =16 years of age. results: gram-positive organisms accounted for 65% of cases, gram-negative organisms accounted for 24% of cases and 11% were caused by fungi. the overall crude mortality was 14% (475 of 3432) but notably higher for infections caused by candida spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 20 and 29%, respectively. the most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (43%), enterococci, staphylococcus aureus and candida spp. (each, 9%). the mean interval between admission and infection averaged 21 days for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 25 days for s. aureus and  candida spp., 32 days for klebsiella spp. and 34 days for enterococcus spp. the proportion of methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased from 10% in 1995 to 29% in 2001. vancomycin-resistance was seen in 1% of enterococcus faecalis and in 11% of enterococcus faecium isolates. conclusion: nosocomial bsi occurred predominantly in very young and/or critically ill children. gram-positive pathogens predominated across all ages, and increasing antimicrobial resistance was observed in pediatric patients.

TI  == disinfection of surfaces by photocatalytic oxidation with titanium dioxide and uva light.
AB  == particularly in microbiological laboratories and areas in intensive medical use,  regular and thorough disinfection of surfaces is required in order to reduce the  numbers of bacteria and to prevent bacterial transmission. the conventional methods of disinfection with wiping are not effective in the longer term, cannot  be standardized, are time- and staff-intensive and use aggressive chemicals. disinfection with hard ultraviolet c (uvc) light is usually not satisfactory, as  the depth of penetration is inadequate and there are occupational medicine risks. photocatalytic oxidation on surfaces coated with titanium dioxide (tio2) might offer a possible alternative. in the presence of water and oxygen, highly reactive oh-radicals are generated by tio2 and mild ultraviolet a (uva). these radicals are able to destroy bacteria, and may therefore be effective in reducing bacterial contamination. direct irradiation with uvc however can produce areas of shadow in which bacteria are not inactivated. using targeted light guidance and a light-guiding sheet (out of a uva-transmittant, plexiglas, for example), as in the method described in the present study, bacterial inactivation over the entire area is possible. the effectiveness of the method was demonstrated using bacteria relevant to hygiene such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. for these bacteria, a reduction efficiency (re) more than 6log10 steps in 60 min was observed. using candida albicans, a re of 2log10 steps in 60 min was seen. light and scanning electron microscopic examinations suggest that the germ destruction achieved takes place through direct damage to cell walls caused by oh-radicals.

TI  == in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
AB  == piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive,  clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised  disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp.,  but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.

TI  == streptomyces speibonae sp. nov., a novel streptomycete with blue substrate mycelium isolated from south african soil.
AB  == an actinomycete with blue substrate mycelium was isolated from a soil sample in cape town, south africa, and designated strain pk-blue(t). the colour of the substrate mycelium was not sensitive to changes in ph. the organism produced hairy spores in spirales-type spore chains. chemical taxonomy indicated that it belonged to the genus streptomyces. strain pk-blue(t) produced no diffusible pigments other than melanin, grew at 45 degrees c, did not degrade adenine and exhibited no antibacterial activity against enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa. analysis of its 16s rrna gene sequence and the results of physiological tests showed that strain pk-blue(t) (= dsm 41797(t) = atcc baa-411(t)) represents the type strain of a novel species of streptomyces, for which the name streptomyces speibonae sp. nov. is proposed.

TI  == in vitro activity of gatifloxacin alone and in combination with cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin and gentamicin against multidrug-resistant organisms.
AB  == objectives: to study the in vitro interaction of gatifloxacin in combination with gentamicin and with the beta-lactams cefepime, meropenem and piperacillin against clinical isolates of stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). methods: the activity of each drug alone was determined by an agar dilution method. chequerboard synergy testing was then performed against all the isolates. time-kill assays were done on selected isolates to assess correlation with the chequerboard results. results: synergy was demonstrated with the following combinations at achievable serum concentrations: gatifloxacin/piperacillin for 80% and gatifloxacin/cefepime for 60% of s. maltophilia; gatifloxacin/gentamicin for 60%, and gatifloxacin/cefepime for 50% of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, and in all drug combinations for 50-70% of p. aeruginosa. indifference was noted for the majority of b. cepacia and vre isolates. antagonism at therapeutic serum levels was observed with gatifloxacin/piperacillin against a single isolate of b. cepacia. no distinct trend in drug interaction was seen with the different drug combinations against mrsa. time-kill analyses against selected isolates confirmed the synergic activity of the following drug combinations seen in the chequerboard assays: gatifloxacin/cefepime and gatifloxacin/piperacillin against p. aeruginosa, gatifloxacin/gentamicin against b. cepacia, and gatifloxacin/gentamicin and gatifloxacin/meropenem against esbl-producing k. pneumoniae. conclusions: gatifloxacin was synergic with the beta-lactams piperacillin, cefepime and meropenem, and with gentamicin against some drug-resistant pathogens. some of the time-kill analyses against p. aeruginosa, b. cepacia and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae were in accordance with chequerboard  results. time-kill analyses against s. maltophilia did not confirm the synergy seen in chequerboard testing.

TI  == emerging bacterial pathogens: a consensus of the scientific data and the risk for development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in the hospital setting is continuing to increase, particularly in intensive care units (icus) and other areas of the hospital such  as oncology units, where the use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics is common. the problem of antibiotic resistance is also compounded in the immunocompromised  patient. multi-drug resistance is common among both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and becoming more prevalent among fungi (yeast). two major antibiotic-resistant pathogens include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). when  infections occur with esbl-kp, a carbapenem antibiotic is usually the drug of choice. when infection occurs with vre, specific therapy is bacteriostatic, and the clinician may have to rely on empirically selected antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics to achieve a positive outcome. two newly-approved agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin can be used to treat infections caused by resistant gram-positive cocci, but the latter is approved for use against vr-e. faecium. risk factors for the development of esbl-kp include the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftazidime. risk factors for the development of vre include inappropriate use of vancomycin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and antianaerobic drug therapy such as clindamycin. several institutions have documented a reduction in one or both of these resistant pathogens following a decrease in the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins combined with the increased use of extended-spectrum penicillins/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, for the empiric therapy  of infections. for vre, a reduction in the inappropriate use of vancomycin is also an important interventional strategy along with improved infection control practice.

AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == strategies to control antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is becoming a worldwide concern. antibiotic resistance may  be caused by sporadic mutations, which are not important unless spread clonally.  clonal resistance may disseminate a highly resistant clone to widespread geographic areas. the most effective interventions to limit the clonal spread of  resistant organisms are effective infection control measures. hospital antibiotic formulary restriction is the only control measure with proven effectiveness to control resistance related to antibiotic use. hospital formularies should eliminate or restrict antibiotics with a high-resistance potential (eg, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem), and should be replaced with equivalent antibiotics with a low-resistance potential (eg, cefe-pime, levofloxacin, and meropenem). such low-resistance-potential antibiotics can either prevent or eliminate resistance problems associated with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. high-resistance-potential antibiotics, particularly ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime, also may indirectly increase the prevalence of highly resistant organisms (eg, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [mrsa], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [vre]). vancomycin use should be restricted, not because it increases enterococcal resistance per se, but because it selects out naturally resistant enterococcal strains (eg, enterococcus faecium that are vancomycin resistant). linezolid does not increase  the prevalence of vre. clinicians in the outpatient setting should also preferentially use oral antibiotics with a low-resistance potential (eg, clindamycin, metronidazole, doxycycline, minocycline, fluoroquinolones except ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and oral cephalosporins) in preference to their high-resistance-potential counterparts. for antibiotic resistance control interventions to be effective, they must be applied simultaneously to all antibiotics with activity against the specific resistance pathogen at the hospital formulary level. multiple antibiotic substitutions are usually necessary to eradicate resistance problems caused by a particular pathogen. multiple drugs  of the same spectrum and low-resistance potential are necessary to eliminate resistance problems; single antibiotic substitutions are not effective.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cutis) between 1988 and 2000. imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting gram-negative rods. resistant strains (mic>16 mg/l) were observed in staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), enterococcus faecalis (4%), enterococcus avium (8%), serratia marcescens (5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over  the period. resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. these results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of dq-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of dq-113, formerly d61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (mic90s) of dq-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. moreover, dq-113 showed the  most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, with a mic90 of 0.25microg/ml. dq-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and dq-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with mic90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, dq-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a mic range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. dq-113 also showed a potent activity against haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (mic90, 0.015 microg/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.03 microg/ml). the activity of dq-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of enterobacteriaceae: the mics of dq-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible pseudomonas  aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. from these results, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.

TI  == crystal structure of vat(d): an acetyltransferase that inactivates streptogramin  group a antibiotics.
AB  == the streptogramin class of antibiotics act to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis, and their semisynthetic derivatives, such as dalfopristin-quinupristin (synercid), are used to treat serious or life-threatening infections due to multiply antibiotic resistant bacteria. acquired resistance of the nosocomial pathogen enterococcus faecium to the group a component of natural and semisynthetic streptogramin mixtures is a prerequisite for the streptogramin resistance phenotype and is mediated by a streptogramin acetyltransferase. the crystal structure of vat(d), a streptogramin acetyltransferase from a human urinary isolate of e. faecium, has been determined as an apoenzyme and in complex with either acetyl-coa or virginiamycin m1 and coa. these structures illustrate the location and arrangement of residues at the active site, and point to his 82  as a residue that may function as a general base. the structural similarity of vat(d) to the xenobiotic acetyltransferase from pseudomonas aeruginosa indicates  similarities in the catalytic mechanism for these enzymes as well as several shared and distinctive antibiotic binding interactions between these enzymes and  their respective substrates. these results reveal the molecular basis for a reaction by which gram-positive cocci acquire resistance to a last resort antibiotic.

TI  == multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in taiwan.
AB  == a susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (icus) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from march, 2000, to june, 2000, in taiwan. this study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (orsa), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), enterobacter cloacae (57%), serratia marcescens (34%), and citrobacter freundii (60%). high rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for p. aeruginosa (15%) and acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. the percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for klebsiella pneumoniae. rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (42%), enterococcus faecium (71%), and orsa (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. the resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of icus. surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in icu settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in icu patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
AB  == resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.

AB  == a study on the joint effect of either nisin or nisaplin, headspace co2 levels, and edta on the survival of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium was carried out in a water-soluble fish muscle extract at 3 degrees c using a second-order rotatable factorial design. e. faecium was completely deactivated by all processing after 2 days of storage. in contrast, p. aeruginosa was much less  susceptible to treatments, and cell death was satisfactorily described by two models. nisin increased cell death, whereas nisaplin (commercial form of nisin) was not suitable, as it caused undesirable interference, presumably due to its co-compounds. interactions between nisaplin or nisin and either edta or co2 were  found to be nonstatistically significant. factors that could account for this unexpected lack of synergism are discussed. however, a statistically significant  positive interaction was found between co2 and edta. this finding could allow co2 levels to be decreased and hence to reduce the main disadvantages of co2 application, namely, exudation and acidification.

AB  == objective: to compare molecular typing by amplified fragment-length polymorphism  (aflp) analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) with respect to the  ability to differentiate between epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates of common nosocomial pathogens recovered during a period of endemicity. design: retrospective laboratory analysis. setting: tertiary-care institution. methods: 17 isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, 22 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 22 vancomycin-resistant enterococcusfaecium (vre) were typed by both methods. results: aflp generated comparable results to pfge for a baumannii and p aeruginosa isolates; both methods identified epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates. however, strain typing of vre isolates produced discordant results between the two methods. pfge identified 10 different strain types and differentiated between all epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates. in contrast, aflp generated only five different strain types, three of which contained both epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates. conclusion: molecular typing by aflp is comparable to pfge for a baumannii and p aeruginosa isolates. for vre isolates, however, pfge remains the method of choice.

TI  == multicenter evaluation of an automated system using selected bacteria that harbor challenging and clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics.
AB  == a multicenter study was carried out to evaluate the performance of a new commercial automated system in comparison with that of the reference agar dilution method. ten clinical microbiology laboratories tested a collection of 61 strains of gram-negative bacilli (49 enterobacteriaceae and 12 pseudomonas aeruginosa), and 6 other laboratories tested a collection of 55 strains of gram-positive cocci (10 enterococci and 45 staphylococci) against 10-20 antimicrobial agents. the strains were selected on the basis that they harbored challenging and characterized mechanisms of resistance. in comparison with the agar reference method, the automated system gave an overall essential agreement (+/-1 dilution) of 94.5%, 93.5%, and 97% for the gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, and staphylococci, respectively. according to the interpretive standards of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards, the category agreement ranged from 96 to 96.4% for the three sets of organisms. the accuracy of the automated system, as determined by the kappa test, ranged from 0.80 to 0.88, reflecting an almost perfect agreement with the reference technique. very major, major, and minor errors obtained with the automated system were 0.3%, 2.9%, and 6.6% for gram-negative bacilli, 3.4%, 0%, and 5% for enterococci, and 1%, 1.6%, and 2.7% for staphylococci, respectively. the high rate of very major errors in enterococci was mostly due to a single strain of multidrug-resistant enterococcus faecium, which was found susceptible to several  antibiotics in a majority of participant laboratories. the use of a heavy inoculum and of a broth test medium by the automated system might account for a better expression of certain resistance mechanisms, including beta-lactamases, as compared to the agar dilution reference method. the interlaboratory reproducibility was acceptable, as shown by the narrow dispersion of mics and by  the results of quality control.

AB  == different procedures are available to inactivate bacteria and fungi, including their spores, as well as viruses in human bone transplants. the most efficient methods are considered to be gamma irradiation and thermal inactivation as well as chemical sterilization methods like the peracetic acid-ethanol treatment (pes). following national and international standards or draft standards, the antimicrobial effectiveness of this procedure was evaluated. due to the standardizable size as well as the clinical relevance, defatted human spongiosa cuboids (15x15x15 mm) served as model system. after treatment with pes for 2 and  4 hours, respectively, the titre of living micro-organisms was determined in the  supernatant and the cuboid. a reduction in the titre of viable micro-organisms below the detection level (reduction factor >5 log10) was already achieved after  an incubation time of 2 hours (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, clostridium sporogenes, mycobacterium  terrae, candida albicans as well as spores of bacillus subtilis). no viable micro-organisms could be detected in any of the pes-treated test cuboids. spores  of aspergillus niger were also completely inactivated. the pes procedure proved to be a reliable method for the sterilization of human bone transplants derived from spongiosa.

TI  == determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  == there are many skin antiseptics commercially available. although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. to date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. an 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems.  freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. a bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. several micro-organisms were investigated: - staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant ent. faecium (vre), s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (pcmx, active compound of dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained  in suspension and glass-carrier tests. the bactericidal activity of the biocides  depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. all biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against ent. faecalis and vre. the antibacterial activity  of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the  suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. in the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of p. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). pcmx, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. chlorhexidine tested against p. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. these results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ  efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.

TI  == [sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
AB  == objective: the aim of this study, conducted in the french military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from  nosocomial infection in intensive care units. patients and methods: a prospective study has been conducted from january to december 1998 in all the intensive care  units of the french army. all the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie". results: a total of 849 strains are included in this study. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by escherichia coli (19%) staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (11%) and enterococci (7%). imipenem was  the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. resistance to iii generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blse) in 36% of cases. this blse could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. the most frequent species producing blse were enterobacter aerogenes (75% of blse) and klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). among the 172 p. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. seventy per cent of the 96 cons and 50.2% of the 126 s. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. a strain of s. aureus and 2 cons strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. twenty per cent of the 59 enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of e. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. one strain of e. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: the evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. high rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among p. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. the implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.

AB  == a proficiency testing project was conducted among 48 microbiology laboratories participating in project icare (intensive care antimicrobial resistance epidemiology). all laboratories correctly identified the staphylococcus aureus challenge strain as oxacillin- resistant and an enterococcus faecium strain as vancomycin-resistant. thirty-one (97%) of 32 laboratories correctly reported the  streptococcus pneumoniae strain as erythromycin-resistant. all laboratories testing the pseudomonas aeruginosa strain against ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin correctly reported the organism as resistant. of 40 laboratories, 30 (75%) correctly reported resistant mics or zone sizes for the imipenem- and meropenem-resistant serratia marcescens. for the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strain of klebsiella pneumoniae, 18 (42%) of 43 laboratories testing ceftazidime correctly reported ceftazidime mics in the resistant range. these results suggest that current testing generally produces accurate results, although some laboratories have difficulty detecting resistance to carbapenems and extended-spectrum cephalosporins. this highlights the need for monitoring how well susceptibility test systems in clinical laboratories detect emerging resistance.

TI  == binding kinetics of triclosan (irgasan) to alloplastic vascular grafts: an in vitro study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the binding kinetics of triclosan (irgasan) to alloplastic vascular grafts and to examine its antimicrobial activity against various microbial pathogens in vitro. vascular grafts made by intergard (intervascular), fluoropassiv (vascutek), and gore-tex (gore) were examined. grafts were incubated in 10 g/l triclosan (irgasan), dried, sterilized, and incubated in rpmi medium. one-centimeter segments of the grafts were resected under sterile conditions at intervals of minutes, then hours, followed by days and up to 4 weeks. samples were stored frozen at -20 degrees c for the measurement of triclosan bound to the vascular graft by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). the binding kinetics under perfusion conditions were determined for intergard grafts, which were perfused with 50 ml of nutrient medium for 24 hr. samples were taken at various time intervals for the measurement of triclosan. the antimicrobial activity of triclosan against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans as well as enterococcus faecium was determined. triclosan effectively binds to vascular graft without the use of intermediate binding substances. it stayed on the graft  for the duration of 4 weeks. under both static and perfusion conditions, the binding kinetics are similar. triclosan binds most effectively to intergard grafts, less so to fluoropassiv grafts, and not at all to gore-tex material. antimicrobial activity of triclosan is very effective against s. aureus and e. faecium but not against p. aeruginosa.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than  comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin mic90s, < or =1 mg/l, except 4 mg/l against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium). gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae (mic90s, 0.06-0.5  mg/l against most members of the enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/l against proteus/morganella spp.). relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against providencia spp., and had good potency against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.25-1 mg/l). gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had  similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding mic90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/l for pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. the three quinolones were equipotent against burkholderia cepacia (mic90s, 8 mg/l), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 mg/l). gatifloxacin was highly potent (mic90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/l) against haemophilus influenzae, legionella spp., helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin mic90s, 0.13 mg/l). the higher quinolone mics for ureaplasma (mic90s, 4-8 mg/l) may be due to  the acidic ph of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against mycobacterium tuberculosis (mic90, 0.25 mg/l). of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. in summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and frequency of occurrence of clinical blood isolates in europe from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997 and 1998.
AB  == as part of the european arm of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 25  european university hospitals referred 9613 blood isolates for in vitro testing against >20 antimicrobial agents. escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were the 5 most frequent isolates and accounted for two-thirds of all  referrals, with minor regional variation. of these, approximately 0.36% of e. coli and 16.7% of k. pneumoniae isolates proved to be potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and their incidence clearly varied regionally. quinolone resistance was detected among gram-negative species; in particular, p.  aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. considerable regional variation was observed in the incidences of methicillin resistance in s. aureus and penicillin  resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. the incidence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci was relatively low overall and primarily associated with enterococcus faecium. however, extrapolation of these data to smaller and nonteaching hospitals should be undertaken with caution, since resistance rates may be lower  in these facilities.

TI  == in vitro action of a combination of selected antimicrobial agents and chondroitin sulfate.
AB  == chondroitin sulfate (cs), a highly anionic polymer and the most predominant sulfated glycosaminoglycan in connective tissues, was investigated regarding to its interaction with cationic disinfectants, which are used as antiinfectives in  humans. combinations of cetylpyridiniumchloride (cpc), chlorhexidine (chex), and  polyhexamethylene biguanide (phmb) with cs, respectively, were prepared and the resulting microbicidal activity of the mixtures was tested in the quantitative suspension test without organic matter. polyvidone-iodine and ringer's solution were used as controls. even precipitated, the resulting test combinations behave  differently against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans. cpc/cs demonstrated only microbicidal activity against gram-positive bacteria, and chex/cs was more active against gram-negative bacteria and c. albicans. phmb/cs, especially in combination with cs-a, only revealed an antimicrobial effect against p. aeruginosa after 60 min action. the interaction of cationic disinfectants with cs showed depending on the investigated microorganism a more or less controlled sustained release manner of the microbicidal agent from the precipitated complex, with the only exception of phmb in combination with cs-c, which is completely neutralized. polyvidone-iodine and ringer's solution were not affected by cs.

TI  == surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, 1998.
AB  == for the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. we re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the  most common isolates were enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among hospital-acquired infections, acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. the oxacillin resistance of s. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. among enterococcus spp., 85% were either e. faecalis or e. faecium. they were 14% resistant to vancomycin. among gram-negative bacteria, k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. this difference was less apparent in the case of enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa. these bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. fifty-one percent of salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. isolates from the east were least resistant. plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we  identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against s. aureus, ciprofloxacin against e. coli, and ciprofloxacin against salmonella spp. these findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.

TI  == united states geographic bacteria susceptibility patterns. 1997 ascp susceptibility testing group.
AB  == antimicrobial drug resistance in bacterial pathogens continues, with 1997 seeing  reports of staphylococcus aureus no longer fully susceptible to vancomycin occurring in the united states. to better deal with this rapidly developing problem, we present the third year of united states national data that highlights the geographic nature of increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. in 1997,  we observed increasing numbers of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, more methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and an apparent spreading of  penicillin resistance in pneumococci. the majority of reporting sites now indicates that over 20% of pseudomonas aeruginosa are fully resistant to ciprofloxacin, the only oral agent available for treating this pathogen. with increasing resistance coming at a time of decreasing available resources, it is more clear than ever before that the future of infectious diseases and clinical microbiology remains filled with challenge.

TI  == prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in 20 european university hospitals participating in the european sentry antimicrobial surveillance programme.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the current prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in europe and compare the in vitro activity of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin against 7057 bacterial isolates from 20 university hospitals participating in the european sentry antimicrobial surveillance programme. amikacin exhibited better in vitro activity than tobramycin and gentamicin against most gram-negative bacilli in europe. the resistance levels were 0.4-3% for amikacin, 2-13.1% for gentamicin, and 2.5-15.3% for tobramycin among different members of the family enterobacteriaceae. of the staphylococcus aureus  isolates tested, 75% were susceptible to gentamicin. only 21% of all enterococcal strains tested were fully susceptible to gentamicin. although intra-country variations in the prevalence of resistance phenotypes in escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as in staphylococci and enterococci did occur, aminoglycoside resistance rates were generally higher in italy, portugal, spain, greece, france, the uk, and poland than in austria, belgium, germany, the netherlands, and switzerland. compared with the 1987-88 data of the european study group on antibiotic resistance, gentamicin resistance  has increased up to 5% in some gram-negative bacterial species. furthermore, a greater than 10% increase in resistance to gentamicin has been seen in staphylococcus aureus during the last decade. the reason for this observation is  unclear, although changes in antibiotic prescribing patterns that result in increased selective pressure from gentamicin may have contributed to these increased rates of aminoglycoside resistance.

TI  == microbial antagonism: a neglected avenue of natural products research.
AB  == competition amongst microbes for space and nutrients in the marine environment is a powerful selective force which has led to the evolution of a variety of effective strategies for colonising and growing on surfaces. we are particularly  interested in the chemical ecology of marine epibiotic bacteria which live on the surfaces of marine algae or invertebrates. over 400 strains of surface-associated bacteria from various species of seaweed and invertebrate from scottish coastal waters were isolated and 35% of them shown to produce antimicrobial compounds. this is a much higher proportion than free living marine isolates or soil bacteria. in addition, many strains which did not normally produce antibiotics could be induced to do so by exposing them to small amounts of live cells, supernatants from other bacterial cultures or other chemicals. thus the number of strains able to produce antibiotics appears to be much higher than previously thought. induction of antibiotic production was elicited by other marine epibionts and also by terrestrial human pathogens such as bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. an understanding of this type of chemical induction and the factors regulating non-constitutive secretion of antimicrobial compounds will allow more effective strategies for searching for new chemotherapeutic antibiotics to be designed.

AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide, is an analog of the magainin peptides isolated from the skin of the african clawed frog. pexiganan exhibited in vitro broad-spectrum antibacterial activity when it was tested against 3,109 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative, anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. the pexiganan mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic90) was 32 micrograms/ml or less for staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, corynebacterium spp., pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., stenotrophomonas spp., certain species of the family enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium spp. comparison  of the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of pexiganan for 143 isolates representing 32 species demonstrated that for 92% of the isolates tested, mbcs were the same or within 1 twofold difference of the mics, consistent with a bactericidal mechanism of action. killing curve analysis showed that pexiganan killed pseudomonas aeruginosa rapidly, with 10(6) organisms/ml eliminated within 20 min of treatment with 16 micrograms of pexiganan per ml. no  evidence of cross-resistance to a number of other antibiotic classes was observed, as determined by the equivalence of the mic50s and the mic90s of pexiganan for strains resistant to oxacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, imipenem, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and clindamicin versus those for strains susceptible to these antimicrobial agents. attempts to generate resistance in several bacterial species through repeated passage with subinhibitory concentrations of pexiganan were unsuccessful. in conclusion, pexiganan exhibits  properties in vitro which make it an attractive candidate for development as a topical antimicrobial agent.

TI  == [the role of carbapenems in the treatment of nosocomial infection].
AB  == carbapenems are active beta-lactam antibiotics versus most of the gram positive and gram negative microorganisms and anaerobes although their activity is lacking in the case of staphylococcus sp. resistant to methicillin, enterococcus faecium  and streptococcus pneumoniae with high resistance to penicillin and some gram negative bacilli which naturally produce an methaloenzyme able to hydrolyze them  such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia. imipenem, the first synthetized carbapenem  requires administration with cilastatin to avoid inactivation by renal dehydropeptidase 1. meropenem does not require being taken with the renal enzyme  inhibitor, with its activity being similar to that of imipenem. in abdominal infection the carbapenems have shown to be the authentic monotherapy in this type of infections being as effective as the different schedules of antibiotic associations normally used. treatment with carbapenems in bacterial meningitis should be currently limited to the cases produced by gram negative bacilli producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamases (wsbl), cases of meningitis by pseudomonas aeruginosa or gram negative bacilli producers of inducible cephalosporinase. meropenem is the carbapenem of choice probably in these cases because the carbapenems are often the only active antibiotics and meropenem, specifically, does not have the risk of convulsions observed with imipenem-cilastatin. the carbapenems have shown to be useful in skin and soft tissue infections as well as in obstetric and gynecologic infections as monotherapy similar to the schedules of the currently used antibiotic associations. in the case of nosocomial pneumonias, all the studies have evaluated the carbapenems in monotherapy as useful and effective, specially in the case of pneumonia by gram negative bacilli. finally, in non filiated nosocomial sepsis and specially in the case of neutropenic patients, the use of carbapenems is particularly attractive in gram negative sepsis in intensive care  units. the appearance in the last few years of strains of gram negative bacilli,  producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamase or stable repressed hyperproducers of class i chromosomic cephalosporinase, as well as other multiresistant gram negative bacilli, such as acinetobacter baumanii make the carbapenems, in many cases, the only effective antibiotic in this type of infections.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

AB  == protegrin-1 (pg-1) is a cysteine-rich, 18-residue beta-sheet peptide isolated from porcine leukocytes with antimicrobial activity against a broad range of microorganisms. the mics of pg-1 against representative gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria ranged from 0.12 to 2 microg/ml. at these levels, pg-1 was rapidly bactericidal in vitro, reducing the number of viable cfu of either methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) or pseudomonas aeruginosa by more than three log units in less than 15 min. resistance to pg-1 did not develop after 11 subculturings of p. aeruginosa or 18 subcultures of mrsa in mueller-hinton broth containing pg-1 at one-half the mic. under similar conditions of serial passage, the mics of norfloxacin and gentamicin against p. aeruginosa increased 10 and 190 times, respectively. similarly, the mic of norfloxacin against mrsa increased 85 times. immunocompetent mice inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with p. aeruginosa or s. aureus exhibited 93 to 100% mortality in the vehicle control group compared with 0 to 27% mortality in animals that received a single i.p. injection of pg-1 (0.5 mg/kg of body weight). mice inoculated with s. aureus by intravenous (i.v.) injection and dosed 0 to 60  min later with a single i.v. injection of pg-1 (5 mg/kg) had a mortality of 7 to  33%, compared to a mortality of 73 to 93% in the vehicle controls. in leukopenic  mice inoculated i.v. with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, mortality was 87% in the vehicle control group and 33% in animals that received a single i.v. injection of pg-1 (2.5 mg/kg). taken together, these data indicate that pg-1 has potential for use as an antimicrobial agent in the treatment of local or systemic infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of squalamine mimics.
AB  == we investigated the antimicrobial properties of compounds with structural features that were designed to mimic those of squalamine, an antibiotic isolated  from the stomach of the dogfish shark. the mimics, like squalamine, are sterol-polyamine conjugates. unlike squalamine, the mimics were simple to prepare, at high yield, from readily available starting materials. several squalamine mimics showed activity against gram-negative rods, gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and fungi. some had little or no hemolytic activity. the hydrophobicity of the sterol backbone and the length and the cationic charge of the side chains appeared to be critical determinants of activity. one of the squalamine mimics, sm-7, was bactericidal against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and s. aureus; its activity was decreased by divalent or monovalent cations and by bovine serum albumin. subinhibitory concentrations of sm-7 markedly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of rifampin against gram-negative rods. these results suggest that the compounds may disrupt an outer membrane of gram-negative rods. squalamine mimics are a new class of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. the antagonism of their activity by serum and albumin and their hemolytic properties may limit their use as systemic agents. the squalamine mimics, because of their potencies, broad spectra of antimicrobial activity, and  potential for systemic toxicity, appear to be good candidates for development as  topical antimicrobial agents.

AB  == the main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus saprophyticus and candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. the residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were  both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. these results support the ongoing  efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.

TI  == in-vitro microbiological assessment of a new penem, men 10700.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of men 10700, a novel penem, has been compared with that of ritipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, cefotaxime and co-amoxiclav against 539 strains taken from 17 genera. men 10700 was most active  against staphylococci and streptococci (mic90 < 0.5 mg/l), slightly less active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., moraxella catarrhalis and peptostreptococci (mic90 0.5-2 mg/l), moderately  active against enterococcus faecalis, members of the tribe proteae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter spp., clostridia and bacteroides spp. (mic90 4-16 mg/l), and inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia  and enterococcus faecium. its antibacterial spectrum is thus slightly less broad  than that of imipenem, but it compares favourably with an oral third-generation cephalosporin. men 10700 was more active than ritipenem against many species, especially enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp.

TI  == high incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units  at a university hospital in sweden.
AB  == the frequency of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units (icus) at a university hospital in sweden was investigated annually from 1993 to  1996. an increase in ampicillin-resistant enterococci from 1993 to 1995 was seen  which was due to a shift from enterococcus faecalis to enterococcus faecium. after a special infection control programme was instituted, the rate of ampicillin resistance among enterococci and the number of e. faecium isolates declined during 1996. the oxacillin resistance rates for staphylococcus aureus were < or = 2%, while most of the coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were oxacillin resistant. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci or staphylococci were seen. the ciprofloxacin resistance rate for cns and enterococci spp. were high. relatively, high levels of resistance to cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam among enterobacter spp. were also seen. during 1995 and 1996 pseudomonas aeruginosa showed increasing resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. this was due to an outbreak among rather few patients. the overall resistance rates for gram-negative bacteria were low for aminoglycosides and imipenem. from 1993 to 1996 the total antibiotic consumption  decreased by 27% in the whole hospital and 16.5% in the icus. however, the reduced antibiotic consumption was paralleled with a 23% decrease in the total number of patients treated in the hospital from 1993 to 1996. in contrast there was an 11.5% increase in the number of icu patients treated during this period. the conclusion is that all icus within a hospital should have a programme for 'on-line' antibiotic resistance surveillance of drugs used in that unit in order  to change the empiric treatment when there is an increase in antibiotic resistance. it is also important to survey the antibiotic consumption in the icus in order to avoid further selective pressure on bacteria showing increased resistance rates.

TI  == in-vitro pharmacodynamic studies of piperacillin/tazobactam with gentamicin and ciprofloxacin.
AB  == six isolates each of enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter spp., serratia spp., acinetobacter spp. and enterobacter  spp. (total 60 strains) were studied against the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam plus gentamicin or ciprofloxacin at physiological concentrations by the microtitre chequerboard method incorporating simultaneous time-kill curves. tazobactam was fixed at 4 mg/l. gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam was a synergic combination against 28 strains at 2 h, 51  at 5 h and 54 at 24 h as assessed by time-kill curves and synergic or additive (fbc index < or = 1) against all 60 strains at 24 h by chequerboards. the corresponding figures for ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam were seven,  26, 52 and 58 respectively. antagonism (fbc index > or = 4) was demonstrated for  one strain to each combination at 24 h. there were no significant differences between fic indices and fbc indices for each antibiotic combination. gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 47 strains by 2 h, 56 by  5 h and 59 by 24 h. ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log  kill for 22 strains by 2 h, 36 by 5 h and 56 by 24 h. in conclusion both antibiotic combinations at physiological concentrations were synergic or additive at 24 h for the majority of strains tested although notably gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave faster kill. antagonism was rarely seen. both combinations are likely to prove beneficial for treatment of serious infections.

TI  == efficacy of abt-719, a 2-pyridone antimicrobial, against enterococci, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental murine pyelonephritis.
AB  == abt-719 is a 2-pyridone antimicrobial which inhibits dna gyrase activity. it has  considerable subcutaneous (sc) and oral efficacy in the treatment of experimental pyelonephritis induced in carrageenan-treated mice by clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. therapeutic ed50s, defined here as producing a 2 log10 reduction in kidney bacterial burden, provide a reliable end point for comparison of drug efficacy in this experimental infection. therapeutic ed50s for abt-719 against these infections were equal to or up to ten-fold lower than those for ciprofloxacin, used as a reference because of similarity in mode of action. against e. faecalis, the therapeutic ed50s for abt-719 were 4.5-13.6 mg/kg.day for sc administration and 6.8-8.9 mg/kg.day for oral administration. abt-719 was  more potent than ciprofloxacin and vancomycin against the e. faecalis strains, which showed ciprofloxacin and vancomycin resistance covering a range of mics. against e. faecium, the therapeutic ed50s for abt-719 were 8.8 mg/kg.day (sc) and 9.4 mg/kg.day (oral). against an isolate of e. faecium showing ciprofloxacin and  vancomycin resistance the ed50 for abt-719 to achieve a 1 log10 reduction in kidney bacterial burden was 17.9 mg/kg.day by sc administration. while abt-719 had lower efficacy against this isolate than against others, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin failed to show efficacy. against e. coli, the therapeutic ed50 for abt-719 was 1.1 mg/kg.day (oral), and against p. aeruginosa, this value was 2.7 mg/kg.day (oral) with values against both of these pathogens similar to those for ciprofloxacin. abt-719, which represents the new 2-pyridone compound class, has promise for the treatment of urinary tract infections, as suggested by the significant efficacy seen against experimental pyelonephritis caused by e. coli,  p. aeruginosa and susceptible and resistant enterococci.

TI  == comparison of antimicrobial properties of monoterpenes and their carbonylated products.
AB  == some monoterpenes and their carbonylated products were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. the carbonylation of tested monoterpenes was shown to increase the bacteriostatic and fungistatic activities specifically  by the contact method. concerning the killing effects, only (1r,2s,5r)-isopulegol, its carbonylated products, and (r)-carvone showed significant bactericidal activities, particularly against enterococcus faecium and escherichia coli above a concentration of 10 microliters/ml. a fungicidal efficiency of (1r,2s,5r)-isopulegol and (r)-carvone against aspergillus niger was also noted. it seems that the presence of an oxygenated function in the framework increases the antimicrobial properties. however, monoterpenes were more active using a micro-atmosphere method.

TI  == [multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  == in 1994, microbiology laboratories of ten portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. from 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples  significant numbers of escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida spp. were isolated. escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. a great variation in resistance values of p. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. resistance to methicillin in s. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an  average of 47%, and it was even higher with s. epidermidis (c.3000) and s. haemolyticus (c.650). only vancomycin was always active against these strains. in e. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. e. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.

TI  == selective isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == broth formulations of two media selective for enterococci, enterococcel, m-enterococcosel broths were supplemented with 6 micrograms of vancomycin per ml  and evaluated for isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). each broth was challenged with various concentrations of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant enterococci and with 193 perianal specimens obtained from patients at risk in our institution for vre colonization. both the enterococcosel and m-enterococcus broths with vancomycin detected as few as 1 to 9 cfu of vre while inhibiting growth of the other organisms tested. enterococcus faecium organisms (mic, > 256  micrograms/ml) were recovered from 66 perianal swab cultures in the enterococcosel-vancomycin broth, and vre were recovered from 62 perianal swab cultures in the m-enterococcus-vancomycin broth. enterococcosel-vancomycin broth  detected vre in perianal specimens 48 h earlier than did m-enterococcus-vancomycin broth. enterococcosel broth with 6 micrograms of vancomycin per ml can be used for the rapid and selective isolation of vre from surveillance specimens.

AB  == eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml,  enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, escherichia coli cs2(r+): 0.10 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, serratia marcescens:  1.56 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam  against gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of pbps of s. aureus, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, even of p. aeruginosa. affinities of sulopenem to pbps-1 and -3 of s. aureus, pbp-2 of e. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (ipm). sulopenem generally has small ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to ia and iib types of beta-lactamases than ipm. no synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. however, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. the cells of e. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 mic of sulopenem. moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-is. sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.

TI  == augmented production of extracellular superoxide by blood isolates of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == to assess the frequency of extracellular superoxide (o-2) production by enterococci, multiple species were surveyed in a whole organism assay for their ability to reduce ferricytochrome c in a superoxide dismutase-inhibitable fashion. for stool and clinical enterococcal isolates and 12 type strains, only enterococcus faecalis (87/91 isolates and atcc 19433), enterococcus faecium (5/13 isolates), enterococcus casseliflavus (atcc 25778), and enterococcus gallinarum (atcc 35038) produced extracellular o-2. among 106 strains comprising 13 species  of enteric gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci, only lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis produced extracellular o-2. mean (+/-se) rates of extracellular o-2 production in vitro by e . faecalis for isolates associated with bacteremia and endocarditis and for isolates from stool were 2.4+/-0.2, 1.9+/-0.2, 1.5+/-0.3 nmol of o-2 min(-1) 10(9) cfu(-1), respectively (p=.025, analysis of variance), suggesting an association between invasiveness and extracellular o-2 production.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == structure-activity relationship of new 2-substituted penem antibiotics.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of three new penems with 4-hydroxyprolinamide, 1-prolinamide and n-methyl-n-2-propionamide substituents, respectively, in position 2 and of their stereoisomers were examined against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all substitutes conferred a broad antibacterial spectrum  on the penem moiety. changes in stereoisomerism selectively improved the activity against e. coli, s. aureus or enterococci. the structure-activity relationships of each compound were discussed in relation to minimum inhibitory concentrations, penicillin-binding protein (pbp) affinity and outer membrane permeability coefficient in e. coli. in this microorganism, pbp 2 was the target for all compounds. changes in stereoisomerism influenced the affinity for pbps 1a/b and 2. all antibiotics easily permeated the outer membrane of e. coli and, within each group of compounds, the penetration rate correlated with the antibacterial activity.

TI  == meropenem: a microbiological overview.
AB  == meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibiotic which has excellent bactericidal  activity in vitro against almost all clinically significant aerobes and anaerobes. its high activity is explained by ease of entry into bacteria combined with good affinity for essential penicillin binding proteins, including those associated with cell lysis. breadth of spectrum is due, in part, to stability to  all serine-based beta-lactamases, including those which hydrolyse third-generation cephalosporins. meropenem has an antibacterial spectrum which is broadly similar to that of imipenem but, whilst slightly less active against staphylococci and enterococci, it is more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  all enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. amongst common human pathogens, only methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococcus faecium are  uniformly resistant to meropenem. the meropenem mics for penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae are higher than for penicillin-susceptible strains but the organisms remain susceptible. clinical susceptibility in vitro to meropenem is defined by mics of < or = 4 mg/l, intermediate susceptibility by mics of 8 mg/l and mics of > or = 16 mg/l define resistance; equivalent figures for zones of growth inhibition are > or = 14 (susceptible), 12-13 (intermediate) and < or = 11 (resistant) mm. studies in guinea pig models of systemic infection and infections localised to the lungs, urinary tract and the central nervous system,  some of which used immunocompromised animals, confirm the potential of meropenem  demonstrated in vitro. these factors, combined with the human plasma, tissue or urinary concentrations of meropenem which exceed modal mics for the pathogens isolated in clinical trials for most or all of the recommended 8 h dosing interval, predict that meropenem should be efficacious in the treatment of infections at many body sites.

TI  == efficacies of abt-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  == the 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. these compounds are potent bacterial dna gyrase inhibitors  which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring  juncture. abt-719 is an s isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. abt-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. abt-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the racemate and r forms of abt-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. the 50% effective doses of abt-719 were at least threefold  lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused  by salmonella typhimurium or listeria monocytogenes. in immunosuppressed mice, abt-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. the pharmacokinetic properties of abt-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. the 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.

AB  == forty-three medical centers participated in a national (united states) surveillance study of parenteral antimicrobial agents as empiric therapy of pathogens isolated from blood, skin wounds, respiratory tract, and urine (> 8500  strains, 200 per laboratory). all laboratories tested each organism by the same reagent disks and/or etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) strips. quality control results validated all laboratories for analyses. the most common isolates were escherichia coli (1648), staphylococcus aureus (1408), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1003), klebsiella species (792), and the enterococci (684). among the tested drugs the percent susceptible rates observed were ofloxacin (83.4%), ciprofloxacin (82.0%), and cefuroxime (62.9%) tested against all organisms; cefazolin (54.7%) and ceftazidime (76.7%) tested against all nonfastidious aerobes; gentamicin (91.2%), imipenem (95.3%), ticarcillin-clavulanate (78.2%), and ceftriaxone (66.2%) tested against gram-negative organisms only; and vancomycin (97.9%) and erythromycin (49.2%) tested against gram-positive aerobes. several drug-resistant species appear to be emerging or increasing in the united  states: (a) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (7.9%, mostly enterococcus faecium); (b) oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (21.0%); (c) third-generation cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, including e. coli and klebsiella species with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (approximately 1.3%-8.6%); (d) penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (17.8%); and (e) ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (14.9%). fluoroquinolone resistance among the enteric bacilli was confirmed in 60 of 66 referred strains (0.8% of total strains), and cross-resistance was high among ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, and norfloxacin (98.3%-100%). seventeen strains of fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric bacilli (0.2% of total) also harbored an esbl and resistance to aminoglycosides. clonal spread within medical centers was observed with the esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae. this national clinical isolate data base continues to demonstrate broad fluoroquinolone efficacy (ofloxacin > ciprofloxacin) against hospital-based pathogens and many strains of  emerging resistant bacteria. continued us surveillance studies are urged to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance and to guide interventions to minimize  its occurrence.

AB  == the bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. in first examinations (i. communication) (19)  the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of  different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined  exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. in this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. the bactericide effect on micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. this results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces  of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.

AB  == the in vitro activities of two glycylcyclines, cl 329,998 and cl 331,002 (two new semisynthetic tetracyclines), were evaluated in comparison with those of tetracycline and other available oral antimicrobial agents. a total of 523 recent clinical isolates were studied, including strains resistant to tetracycline. members of the family enterobacteriaceae were generally > or = 16-fold more susceptible to the glycylcyclines than to tetracycline (although less difference  was seen with proteus spp.). pseudomonas aeruginosa was modestly susceptible to both new compounds (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90], 16 micrograms/ml). tetracycline- and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus were all susceptible to the glycylcyclines (mic90 < or = 1  microgram/ml). streptococci (including streptococcus pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium displayed a bimodal distribution of susceptibility to tetracycline yet were uniformly susceptible to the glycylcyclines (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). the glycylcyclines were highly potent against neisseria, moraxella, haemophilus, and bacteroides spp. (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). strains of chlamydia spp. (three c. trachomatis strains and one c. pneumoniae strain) were inhibited by < or = 0.25 microgram of cl 329,998 or cl 331,002 per ml. two strains of mycoplasma pneumoniae were inhibited by < or = 0.12 microgram of cl 331,002 per ml and by 1 microgram of cl 329,998 per ml. mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium were resistant to the  two glycylcyclines (mic > or = 8 micrograms/ml). these results indicate that the  two glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == post-antibiotic effect of fk-037 and biapenem tested against five bacterial species.
AB  == the in-vitro post-antibiotic effect (pae) was determined for two newer beta-lactams, fk-037 (a cephalosporin) and biapenem (a carbapenem). our pae results for these drugs were consistent with what has been reported previously for similar beta-lactams, e.g. gram-positive organisms had measurable effects (0.4-2.2 hours), while gram-negatives had variable results (0.0 to 1.4 hours). even though the pae test conditions generally coincided with achievable clinical  levels for most organisms tested (< or = 4 mg/l for biapenem and < or = 8 mg/l for fk-037), the marginal or species dependent, short pae values support the selection of multiple daily doses (two-to-four) based on conventional pharmacokinetic parameters such as the cmax, auc, and serum elimination half-life.

TI  == [bacterial reducing qualities of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. i. contamination and sedimentation in humid and dry conditions].
AB  == in this examination the bactericide qualities of different materials were tested. particularly the effect of humidity was examined. 3 materials containing copper ("copper", "brass" and "brass sheet") and 2 materials not containing copper ("polyamide b" and "high-grade steel") were tested. the surfaces of the 5 types of material were contaminated with a suspension of 2 different bacteria species (staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus). after defined exposure times the  survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined by the standardized method of the "guidelines of the german society of hygiene and microbiology". additionally the sedimentation of airborne microorganisms on the materials was tested by determining the number of colony-forming-units after defined exposure times. in further examinations the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. after defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined. the results show, a bactericide quality of copper depends on the percent of copper-content of the tested materials, exposure time, humidity, frequency of contamination and bacteria species. humidity and only single contamination cause  a reduction of bacteria. reduction of gram-negative bacteria is more easily than  reduction of gram-positive bacteria. enterococcus faecium shows the highest, pseudomonas aeruginosa the lowest reduction rate of bacteria in the following sequence: enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == in vitro activity of three carbapenem antibiotics. comparative studies with biapenem (l-627), imipenem, and meropenem against aerobic pathogens isolated worldwide.
AB  == the in vitro activity of biapenem (formerly l-627 or ljc10, 627), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and meropenem against > 6000 clinically significant pathogens isolated in six countries worldwide. biapenem was active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae with a 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) ranging from < or = 0.06 to 2 micrograms/ml. only serratia spp. and providencia spp. were less susceptible (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas maltophilia displayed an mic90 of > or = 8 micrograms/ml biapenem/ml whereas acinetobacter spp. were susceptible at < or = 1 micrograms/ml. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant to biapenem at > 8 micrograms/ml whereas oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci were susceptible at < or = 1 micrograms/ml. biapenem, imipenem, and meropenem displayed poor activity against ent. faecium (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml), and only imipenem displayed slightly better activity against ent. faecalis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml). the rank order of activity against groups of isolates was enterobacteriaceae (meropenem > biapenem > or = imipenem), ps. aeruginosa (biapenem = meropenem = imipenem), oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (imipenem > or = biapenem = meropenem), oxacillin-resistant staphylococci (biapenem = meropenem = imipenem), and enterococcus spp. (biapenem = meropenem =  imipenem). these in vitro suggest that further developmental work on biapenem is  warranted.

TI  == the bactericidal activity of magainins against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of two synthetic magainins, msi 94 and msi 93, were  investigated in vitro against 20 clinical isolates each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium. the ranges of the mics of both agents were 6.25-50 mg/l for p. aeruginosa and 3.13-12.5 mg/l for e. faecium. in time-kill studies, the magainins demonstrated rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against selected isolates of both species. this bactericidal effect was inoculum-dependent for p. aeruginosa in both the logarithmic and stationary phases of growth. bacterial regrowth was regularly observed after 24 h of incubation in the time-kill studies; this was due to loss of antimicrobial activity during overnight incubation rather than to the development of resistance. more rapid and sustained bactericidal activity was noted when the magainins were combined with either silver nitrate (agno3) or gentamicin against  p. aeruginosa and with gentamicin against e. faecium. neither agent produced a post-antibiotic effect on p. aeruginosa.

TI  == identification of the sata gene encoding a streptogramin a acetyltransferase in enterococcus faecium bm4145.
AB  == enterococcus faecium bm4145, a clinical isolate from urine, was resistant to streptogramin group a antibiotics by inactivation. the strain harbored a plasmid  containing a gene, sata, responsible for this resistance; this gene was cloned and sequenced. it encoded sata, a protein deduced to be 23,634 da in mass and homologous with a new family of chloramphenicol acetyltransferases described in agrobacterium tumefaciens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. the similarity of sata to other acetyltransferases, laca (thiogalactoside acetyltransferase) and cyse (serine acetyltransferase) from e. coli, and to two putative acetyltransferases, nodl from rhizobium leguminosarum and urf1 from e. coli, was also observed in a region considered to be the enzyme's active site. acetylation experiments indicated that acetyl coenzyme a was necessary for sata activity and that a single acetylated derivative of pristinamycin iia was produced. other members of the streptogramin a group such as virginiamycin m and rp54476 were also substrates for the enzyme. we conclude that resistance to the streptogramin a group of antibiotics in e. faecium bm4145  is due to acetylation by an enzyme related to the novel chloramphenicol acetyltransferase family.

TI  == multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
AB  == twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam.  high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic  tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst  the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and  co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.

TI  == infection problems for the 1990's--do we have an answer?
AB  == there is and has been continued change in organisms causing infection in the hospital. in the past few years, although gram-negative bacteria have remained a  major cause of mortality, gram-positive bacteria and fungi have become increasingly important. this has caused organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, xanthomonas maltophilia and multiply resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa to be common pathogens. can this difficult state of affairs be changed by better antimicrobial prescribing practices? yes and no. virtually any agent will select mrsa and mrse since the chromosomal location of the resistance of multiple-antibiotics makes such selection common and explains the rapid rate of the fluoroquinolones as therapy of mrsa. restriction of oral vancomycin will markedly reduce the pressure to select enterococcus faecium and thus limit the spread of the organisms and delay transmission of glycopeptide resistance to s. aureus. judicious use of antibiotics in the intensive care environment will be major factor in "saving" antibiotics for other patients since the icu patient goes to other parts of the hospital carrying with him/her the baggage of resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, klebsiella, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter, xanthomonas and pseudomonas cepacia. all of these organisms have the potential to become resistant to the agents heretofore used to treat them and are common in icu patients.

AB  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium. the size determinations of og1x, a strain of e. faecalis widely used in  many laboratories for genetic studies, using sma i, not i, and sfi i alone or in  combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. using the same enzymes as with og1x,  the size of hh-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of e. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of jh2-2, an e. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. the size range generated for ge-1, a plasmid-free  e. faecium strain, with the use of sma i, not i, and apa i was 2,045-2,155 kb. although og1x differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual  enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. however, for both e. faecalis og1x and e. faecium ge-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other  two enzymes. the discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two  enzymes are used to size a genome. the size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. the molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for campylobacter, smaller than that of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (og1x) or smaller (jh2-2, hh67, and ge-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for streptococcus mutans.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == effect of acidity and antimicrobial agent-like compounds on viability of plesiomonas shigelloides.
AB  == nineteen plesiomonas shigelloides strains were evaluated for their stability at acidic and slightly alkaline phs and for their susceptibility to antimicrobial agent-like compounds produced by enteric flora. most p. shigelloides isolates were rapidly inactivated under high-acid (ph 4 or less) conditions. screening of  enteric bacteria for elaboration of factors active against p. shigelloides revealed two organisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus [enterococcus] faecium) capable of secreting such inhibitory substances. the results of this study suggest some factors potentially important in regulating gastrointestinal colonization by p. shigelloides from environmental sources.
