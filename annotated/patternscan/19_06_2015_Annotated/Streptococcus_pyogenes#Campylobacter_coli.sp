TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) grown in r. macedonia.
AB  == background: there are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (eob) or leaves (eol) of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia. materials and methods: plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (gc/fid/ms) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. results and discussion: eob yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for eol. two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in eob and 33.83% in eol), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in eob and 28.52-29.49% in eol), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene  and alpha-thujene. the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of eob was haemophilus influenzae (mic = 31 mul/ml). eol have showed high activity towards: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mic = 125 mul/ml). the pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter jejuni (mic >50%). the sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to streptococcus pyogenes, haemopilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (mic >50%). no activity was observed toward candida albicans. conclusion: the analysis of eob and eol revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the macedonian juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.

TI  == pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  == this paper describes a new dna chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly  from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine  mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus canis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus parauberis, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma spp., salmonella spp., bacillus spp., campylobacter spp., and escherichia coli and related species. these groups were identified based on the 16s rrna gene. for microarray validation, 22 strains from the american type culture collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested.  the results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. the universal array  described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.

TI  == skim milk enhances the preservation of thawed -80 degrees c bacterial stocks.
AB  == the results from bacterial strain recovery efforts following hurricanes katrina and rita are reported. over 90% of strains frozen in 10% skim milk were recovered whereas various recovery rates were observed for glycerol-stored stocks (56% and  94% of escherichia coli, depending upon the laboratory). these observations led to a viability comparison of streptococcus pyogenes, campylobacter jejuni, borrelia burgdorferi, salmonella enterica subsp. typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. coli strains stored in glycerol or skim milk. in all bacteria examined, 10% skim milk resulted in significantly longer viability after thawing  than 15% glycerol solutions currently used in most laboratories.

TI  == [aetiology and antibiotic sensitivity of the most frequent outpatient infections].
AB  == the diffusion of the outlines of antibiotic sensitivity is a practice that is recommended for improving the prescription of antibiotics and for controlling the appearance and spread of resistances. during the years 2003 and 2004, data was gathered on the sensitivity to antibiotics of the main bacteria isolated in outpatient urine cultures, coprocultures, faringoamygdal and otic smears in the pamplona health area, which attends to a population of approximately 400,000 inhabitants. of the 9,495 uropathogens isolated, 90% were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, 96.4% to 2nd generation cephalosporins, 95.3% to phosphomycin and 97.7% to nitrofurantoin. one point eight percent (1.8%) of the strains of escherichia coli isolated in urine were producers of extended spectrum b-lactamases, while 0.5% of the urinary isolations of klebsiella pneumoniae were  producers of this type of b-lactamases. ninety-six point five percent of the 797  isolations of salmonella serotipo enteritidis were sensitive to cotrimoxazol, and 97.5% of the 1,057 isolations of campylobacter jejuni were sensitive to eritromycine. of the 319 bacteria isolated in otitis media, 96.5% were sensitive  to amoxyline. the gram negative bacillae producers of otitis externa showed a sensitivity above 90% to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin and polimixin b. twenty-nine point seven percent of the isolations of streptococcus pyogenes were resistant to eritromycine. fourteen point three percent and 17.4% of the staphylococcus aureus isolated in the years 2003 and 2004 respectively were resistant to methicillin. knowledge of the map of antibiotic sensitivity of the microorganisms in circulation in each geographical area is information that is necessary for the empirical choice of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == analysis of the prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes in clinical isolates  of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium in a japanese hospital.
AB  == prevalence of seven tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) genes--tet(l), tet(m), tet(k), tet(o), tet(s), tet(t), and tet(u)--which are known to be distributed to  gram-positive cocci was analyzed for 224 enterococcus faecalis and 46 enterococcus faecium clinical isolates obtained in a japanese hospital. any of the tc(r) genes was detected in 75.9% of all the enterococcal strains. the tet(m) was detected at highest rates in both e. faecalis (75.0%) and e. faecium (69.6%), followed by tet(l), which was harbored in 6.7% of e. faecalis isolates and 30.4%  of e. faecium isolates. the tet(o), tet(s), and tet(t) were detected in e. faecalis at low frequencies mostly associated with tet(m), while tet(k) and tet(u) were not detected. nucleotide sequences of tet(s) from e. faecalis strains were identical to that reported in listeria monocytogenes. sequences of tet(o) from two e. faecalis strains were almost identical to each other and also to those from streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans, campylobacter jejuni, and campylobacter coli, although minor sequence divergence was observed. the tet(t), which had been reported only in streptococcus pyogenes, was found in five e. faecalis strains. sequence of the enterococcal tet(t) differed from that of s. pyogenes by only four nucleotides (four amino acids) and showed high sequence identity (99.8%, amino acid level). enterococcal strains with any one tc(r) gene or those with two tc(r) genes showed generally similar mics of tetracyclines, and no evident difference in resistance  level was observed.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and policy in belgium.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide, also in belgium. a few examples to illustrate this problem: s. pneumoniae are becoming increasingly resistant to penicillin and erythromycin; resistance of s. pyogenes to erythromycin is increasing year-by-year; salmonella and campylobacter are becoming more and more  resistant to the fluoroquinolones. in hospitals, the problem of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus appears to be decreasing, but two clones of ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter aerogenes are spreading throughout the belgian hospitals. antibiotic resistance has become a serious health care issue both in hospitals and in the community. the popular press has termed some of the multiresistant organisms "killer bugs" or "superbugs". infection with such organisms has been associated with treatment failures, higher morbidity and mortality and increased costs. in this paper, we will review the problems of antibiotic resistance in the community setting. we will briefly discuss those pathogens with important consequences of morbidity and mortality in the community, such as: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, neisseria meningitidis, the enteric pathogens salmonella and campylobacter, and the urinary tract pathogen e. coli. this resistance has in response to various conditions and opportunities, such as: clustering and overcrowding, increased number of immunodeficient patients, increased elderly population, population mobility, increased use of (broad-spectrum) antibiotics, over-the-counter sale and self-dosing with antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and lack of  compliance, fewer resources for education and infection control, decreased funding for public health surveillance. in belgium, we should be able to develop, implement and evaluate a good antibiotic policy. our country has a wealth of information on antibiotic consumption in hospitals and the community. this information has been used for benchmarking of antibiotic consumption in hospitals. a unique system for reimbursement of prophylactic use of antibiotics in surgery was developed which resulted in a more adequate use of antibiotics. however, a policy should not be limited to the human ecosystem. therefore, a coordination commission for antibiotic policy was installed recently by the ministers of social affairs, public health and agriculture.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sy5555 in the pediatric field].
AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sy5555, a new oral penem, were carried out, and the following results were obtained. 1. mics were determined for 6 drugs, sy5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (cva/ampc), cefaclor  (ccl), cefotiam (ctm), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefdinir (cfdn) against 20 strains of  bacteria isolated from patients who were subsequently treated with sy5555. mics of sy5555 for gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.05 to 0.10 microgram/ml against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus. the mic was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against one strain of streptococcus pyogenes, and mics were from < or = 0.025 to  0.39 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae. these mic values were equivalent or superior to those of the other 5 drugs. mics of sy5555 for gram-negative bacilli were 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml against haemophilus influenzae, and these values were equivalent to those of the other drugs, except  cpdx. the mic of sy5555 was 0.39 microgram/ml against 2 strains of escherichia coli, and this value was equivalent or superior to those of cva/ampc and ccl, similar or inferior to those of cpdx and cfdn, and inferior to that of ctm. the mics of several drugs were determined for 10 strains of bordetella pertussis and  30 strains of campylobacter jejuni isolated from patients before this clinical study. the mics of sy5555 against the 10 strains of b. pertussis were compared with those of 7 drugs, ccl, ctm, cpdx, ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm) and erythromycin (em). the mic of sy5555 was 0.78 microgram/ml against all of the strains. this value was superior to those of ccl, ctm and cpdx, similar or inferior to that of ipm and inferior to those of pipc and em. the mics of sy5555 against the 30 strains of c. jejuni were compared with those of 7 drugs. ccl, ctm, cpdx, cfdn, abpc, ipm and em, and the mic of sy5555 was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml or 0.05 microgram/ml and these values were equivalent or  superior to those of the 7 reference drugs. 2. sy5555 dry syrup was administered  orally at 30 min. after meals, to a total of 5 patients, at doses of 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg to 2 patients each and at a dose of 15.0 mg/kg to one patient and the plasma concentrations were determined. peak concentrations were detected 1 to 3 hours after administration in all patients and the peak concentrations were 0.93  and 1.21 micrograms/ml at the 5.0 mg/kg dose, 2.85 and 5.49 micrograms/ml at the  10.0 mg/kg dose and 5.79 micrograms/ml at the 15.0 mg/kg dose.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  == in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of  cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal  activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large  bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.

TI  == [preparation and use of fish fillet infusion as a basic medium for culturing bacteria].
AB  == the authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (ifp) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. the infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with ifp as well as in recommended standard media. solid media used for cultivation of s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, n. meningitidis and c. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. all of these strains grew on the media prepared with ifp except s.  pneumoniae when cultured in ifp diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. only s. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. no more  differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. the growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and b. subtilis was  measured in liquid media after 8 hours. in solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in ifp-agar and nutriente agar by the number of colonies on trypticase soy agar plates. some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated  in standard media. the average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of ifp was 5.03 mg/ml. the experiments showed that culture media prepared with ifp supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. it suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.

TI  == coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. iii. microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  == the coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. all microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. the mic90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine  are as follows: staphylococcus aureus 1.0, streptococcus pyogenes 8, enterobacteriaceae 2.0, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli 1, legionella pneumophila 8, haemophilus influenzae 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some peptostreptococcus strains. the aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, p. aeruginosa bmh 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (mic 0.2 micrograms/ml). coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for s.  aureus. the viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the mic (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. the frequency of resistance development was less than 1 x 10(-9) for escherichia coli and s. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the mic. the cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of  coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. coumamidine is stable in serum. in mouse protection tests against s. aureus nctc 10649 the ed50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. the antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.

TI  == a-61827 (a-60969), a new fluoronaphthyridine with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == a-61827 (a-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of a-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  the mics of a-61827 for 90% of strains (mic90) of staphylococci and streptococci  were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. the mic90s of a-61827 for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold  dilutions more active than a-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter jejuni, and haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of a-61827 per ml. the mic90 of a-61827 for legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. a-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. the mic90 of a-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. in mouse protection tests, a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin  against escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse bacteroides fragilis abscess model. after oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of a-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of cefotiam therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  == cefotiam (ctm) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. twenty-six  patients were treated with 40 to 200 mg/kg per day of ctm by intravenous administrations. the diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute  bronchitis (1), pneumonia (4), empyema (2), urinary tract infection (2), typhoid  fever (1), acute enterocolitis (2), partially-treated purulent meningitis (1), and suspected septicemia in neuroblastoma (1); and the remaining ten patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. the pathogens recovered were streptococcus pyogenes (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), staphylococcus aureus (4), haemophilus influenzae (4), escherichia coli (1), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (1), salmonella typhi (1), and campylobacter jejuni (1). all but two patients of bacterial infections were cured after the ctm therapy, and the rate of efficacy was 87.5%. diarrhea (3), urticaria (1), transient elevation of got and gpt (1), and transient eosinophilia (3) were found to be associated with  the ctm therapy. however, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. half life of the serum ctm level was 0.93 +/- 0.13 hours, and excretion into the urine was  rapid. csf concentration obtained 1 hour after an intravenous injection of 21 mg/kg of ctm in a case with inflamed meninges was 1.5 mcg/ml, and the csf/serum ratio was 9.0%. from these data, ctm appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
