TI  - Genotoxicity assessment of multispecies probiotics using reverse mutation, mammalian chromosomal aberration, and rodent micronucleus tests.
AB  - Genotoxicity assessment is carried out on freeze dried powder of cultured probiotics containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus LCR177, Bifidobacterium adolescentis BA286, and Pediococcus acidilactici PA318. Ames tests, in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration assay, and micronucleus tests in mouse peripheral blood are performed. For 5 strains of Salmonella Typhimurium, the Ames tests show no increased reverse mutation upon exposure to the test substance. In CHO cells, the frequency of chromosome aberration does not increase in responding to the treatment of probiotics. Likewise, the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes in probiotics-fed mice is indistinguishable from that in the negative control group. Taken together, the toxicity assessment studies suggest that the multispecies probiotic mixture does not have mutagenic effects on various organisms.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria attenuate the proinflammatory response in intestinal epithelial cells induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - Inflammation is a physiological response to infections and tissue injury; however, abnormal immune responses can give rise to chronic inflammation and contribute to disease progression. Various dietary components, including probiotic lactic acid bacteria and prebiotics, have the potential to modulate intestinal inflammatory responses. One factor in particular, the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL-8), is one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. The purpose of this study was to investigate modulation of the inflammatory host response induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 in the presence of selected probiotics and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from human sources, dairy products, and farm animals. IL-8 gene expression and protein production in HT-29 cells were evaluated by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Pre-incubation of HT-29 cells with Lactobacillus kefir IM002, Bifidobacterium adolescentis FRP 61, Bifidobacterium longum FRP 68 and FRP 69, Bifidobacterium breve FRP 334, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides IM080 significantly inhibited IL-8 secretion induced by Salmonella Typhimurium DT104. Co-culture of selected probiotics and Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 reduced IL-8 production, while potential probiotics and LAB had no effect on IL-8 secretion in HT-29 cells preincubated with Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 prior to adding probiotics. Lactobacillus kefir IM002 supernatant also significantly reduced IL-8 production. In conclusion, our study suggests that probiotic bifidobacteria and LAB modulate cytokine induction and possess anti-inflammatory properties; however, the effectiveness is strain dependent.
TI  - [The action of a preparation of Escherichia coli M-17 growth autostimulants (Actoflor) on the growth of pure and mixed bacterial cultures].
AB  - The effect of the preparation of E. coli M-17 low-molecular exometabolites (Actoflor), containing growth autostimulators, on the growth of pure cultures of E. coli M-17 E. coli K-12, Salmonella enteritidis, Serratia marcescens and Bifidobacterium adolescentis MC-42 was studied. This preparation was shown to stimulate the growth of all above-mentioned bacteria. The addition of Actoflor also led to the acceleration of growth in the cultivation of mixed cultures of E. coli M-17 with E. coli K-12 (or S. enteritidis), the producer strain (E. coli M-17) showing the highest degree of acceleration. Moreover, the action of Actoflor led to the elimination of competitor strains and to the increase of the antagonistic activity of E. coli M-17. Actoflor may be supposedly used as a therapeutic or prophylactic remedy.
