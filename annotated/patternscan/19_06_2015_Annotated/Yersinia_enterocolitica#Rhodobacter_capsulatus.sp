TI  == ferrioxamine uptake in yersinia enterocolitica: characterization of the receptor  protein foxa.
AB  == the gene for the high-affinity outer membrane ferrioxamine receptor foxa of yersinia enterocolitica was cloned in escherichia coli k-12. a foxa mutant of yersinia could be complemented by the cloned dna fragment. the foxa encoding region was sequenced and an open reading frame encoding 710 amino acids, including a signal sequence of 26 amino acids, was deduced. the mature foxa protein consisted of 684 amino acids and had a molecular mass of 75,768 da. foxa  shared 33% amino acid sequence homology with fhua, the ferrichrome receptor of escherichia coli. based on the homologies with fhua and other tonb-dependent receptors a topological model of foxa is presented.
