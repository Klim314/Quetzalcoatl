TI  == small rnas in the genus clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. small rnas (srnas) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not  been investigated in clostridia. research on srnas in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify srna candidates, thus delegating clostridial srna research to a hit-and-miss process. thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential srnas in the clostridium genus to open up the field  of srna research in clostridia. using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted srnas in 21 clostridial genomes: clostridium acetobutylicum, c. beijerinckii, c. botulinum (eight strains), c. cellulolyticum, c. difficile, c. kluyveri (two strains), c. novyi, c. perfringens (three strains), c. phytofermentans, c. tetani, and c. thermocellum. although more than one-third of predicted srnas have shine-dalgarno (sd) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of sd sequences; thus, most of the predicted srnas are noncoding rnas. quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (q-rt-pcr) and northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of srnas in c. acetobutylicum and several c. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested  srnas. we identified a conserved, novel srna which, together with the downstream  gene coding for an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. the number of predicted srnas correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic,  and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16s rrna-based phylogeny.
