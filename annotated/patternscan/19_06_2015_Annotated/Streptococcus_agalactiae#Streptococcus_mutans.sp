TI  == [species and quantitative characteristics of pharyngeal mucosa microflora in pregnant women].
AB  == aim: species and quantitative characteristics of upper respiratory tract (urt) mucosa microflora in women at gestation period. materials and methods: the results of a bacteriological study of 68 samples of mucus from posterior pharyngeal wall in women at gestation period (from 14 weeks), 52 of those--from pregnant women with acute respiratory infection (ari) symptoms and 16--from women without signs of disease, are presented. qualitative and quantitative composition of microflora was studied by a generally accepted bacteriological method. results: during primary bacteriological study 111 microorganism cultures were isolated. 88 (79.3%) of strains belonged to gram-positive flora, 20 (18.0%)--to gram-negative, and candida genus fungi constituted 3 (2.7%) isolates. streptococcus pyogenes and moraxella catarrhalis were isolated from pregnant women with ari signs at 23.1% and 5.8% frequency of occurrence, respectively. a higher detectability of staphylococcus aureus--in 31.3% and candida spp.--in 6.3% of women who did not complain as opposed to patients with urt lesions (in 21.2 and 3.9%, respectively) was determined. in patients without ari signs the amount  of bacteria did not exceed 10(5)--10(6) cfu/ml, in pregnant women with ari diagnosis in 8 of 52 cases semination of pharyngeal mucuswas observed--10(7)--10(8) cfu/ml. conclusion: prevalence of s. aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, streptococcus mutans in composition of pharyngeal mucus  microflora of pregnant women both with urt lesion signs and without them was shown, however the degree of semination by pathogens in the groups was different  that determined the severity of disease manifestations.

TI  == the streptococcus iniae transcriptional regulator cpsy is required for protection from neutrophil-mediated killing and proper growth in vitro.
AB  == the ability of a pathogen to metabolically adapt to the local environment for optimal expression of virulence determinants is a continued area of research. orthologs of the streptococcus iniae lysr family regulator cpsy have been shown to regulate methionine biosynthesis and uptake pathways but appear to influence expression of several virulence genes as well. an s. iniae mutant with an in-frame deletion of cpsy (deltacpsy mutant) is highly attenuated in a zebrafish  infection model. the deltacpsy mutant displays a methionine-independent growth defect in serum, which differs from the methionine-dependent defect observed for  orthologous mutants of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus agalactiae. on the  contrary, the deltacpsy mutant can grow in excess of the wild type (wt) when supplemented with proteose peptone, suggesting an inability to properly regulate  growth. cpsy is critical for protection of s. iniae from clearance by neutrophils in whole blood but is dispensable for intracellular survival in macrophages. susceptibility of the deltacpsy mutant to killing in whole blood is not due to a  growth defect, because inhibition of neutrophil phagocytosis rescues the mutant to wt levels. thus, cpsy appears to have a pleiotropic regulatory role for s. iniae, integrating metabolism and virulence. furthermore, s. iniae provides a unique model to investigate the paradigm of cpsy-dependent regulation during systemic streptococcal infection.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == antimicrobial and anti-adhesive potential of a biosurfactant rufisan produced by  candida lipolytica ucp 0988.
AB  == in the last years, researches developed with biosurfactants for application in the medical area have been revealing the promising biological activities of these biomolecules. in this work the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of a biosurfactant rufisan isolated from the yeast candida lipolytica ucp 0988, growth in a medium supplemented with ground nut refinery residue was determined against  several microorganisms. the biosurfactant was able to reduce the water surface tension from 70 to 25.3 mn/m and showed a critical micelle concentration (cmc) of 0.03%. the biosurfactant was isolated after 72 h of fermentation and was tested in concentrations varying from 0.75 to 12 mg/l. the highest antimicrobial activities were observed against streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mutans,  streptococcus mutans ns, streptococcus mutans hg, streptococcus sanguis 12, streptococcus oralis j22 at a concentration superior to the biosurfactant critical micelle concentration. moreover, the biosurfactant showed anti-adhesive  activity against most of the microorganisms tested. as far as we know, this is the first compilation of data on antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities of a  biosurfactant obtained from a candida strain against such a broad group of microorganisms. the results obtained in this work showed that the biosurfactant from c. lipolytica is a potential antimicrobial and/or anti-adhesive agent for several biomedical applications.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == the changing faces of streptococcus antigen i/ii polypeptide family adhesins.
AB  == streptococcus mutans antigen i/ii (agi/ii) protein was one of the first cell wall-anchored adhesins identified in gram-positive bacteria. it mediates attachment of s. mutans to tooth surfaces and has been a focus for immunization studies against dental caries. the agi/ii family polypeptides recognize salivary  glycoproteins, and are also involved in biofilm formation, platelet aggregation,  tissue invasion and immune modulation. the genes encoding agi/ii family polypeptides are found among streptococcus species indigenous to the human mouth, as well as in streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. suis. evidence of functionalities for different regions of the agi/ii proteins has emerged. a sequence motif within the c-terminal portion of streptococcus gordonii sspb (agi/ii) is bound by porphyromonas gingivalis, thus promoting oral colonization by this anaerobic pathogen. the significance of other epitopes is now clearer following resolution of regional crystal structures. a new picture emerges of the central v (variable) region, predicted to contain a carbohydrate-binding trench,  being projected from the cell surface by a stalk formed by an unusual association between an n-terminal alpha-helix and a c-terminal polyproline helix. this presentation mode might be important in determining functional conformations of other gram-positive surface proteins that have adhesin domains flanked by alpha-helical and proline-rich regions.

TI  == transcriptional analysis of the gdha gene in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == aims: to study the transcriptional analysis of glutamate dehydrogenase gene, involved in the amino acid conversion to aroma compound in streptococcus thermophilus. methods and results: analysis of the gdha gene nucleotide sequence  of s. thermophilus cnrz1066 revealed that the coding region is 1353 nucleotides long. the deduced amino acids sequence exhibits the putative gdh active site and  some conserved domains characteristic of family i of hexameric gdhs. phylogenetic analysis revealed that the gdh gene of s. thermophilus clustered with the orthologues of other streptococci such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus infantarius. studying the structural organization of the gdha locus the amino acid similarity of gdhs was higher than 87%, but the locus organization was not conserved. a dominant transcript of approximately 1.4  kbp was revealed by northern blot hybridization, suggesting that gdha mrna is monocystronic. primer extension showed that transcription start point of gdha was localized 43 bp upstream of the potential start codon (atg). conclusions: the gdha represents a monocistronic operon highly conserved in phylogenetic-related bacteria. significance and impact of the study: a deeper knowledge of gdh transcriptional mechanisms could lead to develop s. thermophilus industrial starter cultures with optimized aromatic properties.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus gordonii prophage ph15: complete genome sequence and functional analysis of phage-encoded integrase and endolysin.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii omz1039, isolated from supragingival dental plaque, was found to harbour a prophage, ph15, whose excision could be induced by mitomycin treatment. phage ph15 belongs to the siphoviridae. the complete genome sequence of ph15 was determined. the genome was 39 136 bp in size and contained 61 orfs. the genome of ph15 was most similar in the structural module to the temperate bacteriophages mm1 and phinih1.1 from streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus  pyogenes, respectively. in strain omz1039, ph15 was found to reside as a prophage in the cysteinyl-trna gene. a plasmid, harbouring the attp site and the integrase gene downstream of a constitutive promoter, was capable of site-specific integration into the genomes of different oral streptococcal species. the phage endolysin was purified after expression in escherichia coli and found to inhibit  growth of all s. gordonii strains tested and several different streptococcal species, including the pathogens streptococcus mutans, s. pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae.

TI  == the oligopeptide (opp) gene cluster of streptococcus mutans: identification, prevalence, and characterization.
AB  == introduction: the opp system is an atp-binding cassette-type transporter formed by membrane-associated proteins required for the uptake of oligopeptides in bacteria. in gram-positive bacteria, the opp system, and particularly the oligopeptide-binding protein (oppa), has been shown to be involved in different aspects of cell physiology, including intercellular communication and binding to  host proteins. methods: in the present study we began to investigate the opp system of streptococcus mutans, the main etiological agent of dental caries. results: five opp genes (oppabcdf) organized in a single operon were identified in the genome of the s. mutans ua159 strain. amino acid sequence analyses showed  that the s. mutans oppa is closely related to an ortholog found in streptococcus  agalactiae. incubation of s. mutans ua159 cells with an anti-oppa-specific serum  did not inhibit biofilm formation on polystyrene plates. moreover, s. mutans ua159 derivatives carrying deletions on the oppa or oppb genes did not show significant growth impairment, increased sensitivity to aminopterin, or defective capacity to form biofilms on polystyrene wells in the presence or not of saliva.  remarkably, only two out of three laboratory strains and one out of seven clinical strains recovered from tooth decay processes harbored a copy of the oppa gene and expressed the oppa protein. conclusion: collectively, these results indicate that, in contrast to other streptococcus species, the s. mutans opp system, and particularly the oppa protein, does not represent an important trait  required for growth and colonization.

TI  == hypothesis: neonatal respiratory distress may be related to asymptomatic colonization with group b streptococci.
AB  == background: phospholipids from the group b streptococcal (gbs) cell wall cause pulmonary hypertension in experimental animals. when exposed to penicillin, streptococcus mutans releases phospholipids immediately. we hypothesize that newborns colonized with gbs receive bacterial phospholipids leading to pulmonary  hypertension and respiratory distress, especially in the situation of newborns of penicillin-treated mothers. we examined clinical and epidemiologic data on these  relations. methods: we used data from a prospective multicenter gbs study conducted from 1995 to 1999 in which 1674 of 17,690 newborns cultured at 4 sites  were colonized with gbs. our analyses included 1610 colonized newborns > or =32 weeks gestation without early-onset disease. clinical features were compared between 1003 lightly colonized (gbs positive at < or =2 sites) and 607 heavily colonized (positive at 3 or 4 sites) newborns. the rates of respiratory distress  were compared between colonized newborns of penicillin-treated mothers and those  of untreated mothers. results: of the 1610 colonized newborns, 8.8% had signs of  respiratory distress within 48 hours after birth (cases). oxygen supplementation  was used in 60% of the cases, mechanical ventilation was required in 5% and persistent pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed in 2%. compared with light colonization, heavy colonization increased the rate of respiratory distress 1.73-fold (95% ci, 1.26-2.38), a discharge diagnosis of respiratory disorder 2.02-fold (95% ci, 1.16-3.52), a blood/cerebrospinal fluid obtained for culture 1.54-fold (95% ci, 1.24-1.93) and antibiotic administration after birth 1.87-fold (95% ci, 1.34-2.61). penicillin use during labor was associated with a 2.62-fold  (95% ci, 1.79-3.83) increase in respiratory distress in the colonized newborn. conclusions: our findings support the association of neonatal respiratory distress with asymptomatic gbs colonization and with penicillin use during labor. these data require confirmation.

TI  == gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  == bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (lgt) is  a predominant force in bacterial evolution. to better understand the significance of lgt, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal  genomes using a maximum likelihood method. this study indicates that the rate of  gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each  species. we have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by lgt and conclude that at least  a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.

TI  == functional analysis of glucan binding protein b from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == mutans streptococci are major etiological agents of dental caries, and several of their secreted products contribute to bacterial accumulation on teeth. of these,  streptococcus mutans glucan binding protein b (gbpb) is a novel, immunologically  dominant protein. its biological function is unclear, although gbpb shares homology with a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase from s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, indicative of a role in murein biosynthesis. to determine the cellular function of gbpb, we used several approaches to inactivate the gene, analyze its expression, and identify interacting proteins. none of the transformants analyzed were true gbpb mutants, since they all contained both disrupted and wild-type gene copies, and expression of functional gbpb was always conserved. thus, the inability to obtain viable gbpb null mutants supports the notion that gbpb is an essential gene. northern blot and real-time pcr analyses suggested that induction of gbpb expression in response to stress was a strain-dependent phenomenon. proteins that interacted with gbpb were identified in pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, and these data suggest that gbpb interacts with ribosomal protein l7/l12, possibly as part of a protein complex involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and cell division.

TI  == [evaluation of prolex for the rapid identification of streptococci isolated in medical microbiology].
AB  == the need to rapidly identify streptococci responsible for acute infectious diseases has led to the development of agglutination techniques that are able to  identify streptococcal group antigens (a, b, c, d, f, and g) directly from primoculture colonies on blood agar. the prolex agglutination tests (pro-lab diagnostics, richmond hill, ontario, canada), distributed in france by i2a, have  been used for the determination of group antigens of 166 isolates of streptococci and enterococci previously identified in the national reference center for streptococci. the results obtained with the prolex reagents have permitted to correctly identify all pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci (23 streptococcus pyogenes, 21 streptococcus agalactiae, 33 streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis including 6 group c and 27 group g, and 5 streptococcus porcinus including 4 group b). four differences between unexpected agglutinations (a or f) and species identifications have been obtained. these differences were observed for four non-hemolytic isolates of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii,  streptococcus infantarius, and streptococcus suis. the anti-d reagent has been of value as a marker for isolates of enterococci. thus, these results confirm the abilities of these agglutination tests for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. moreover, the use of prolex has the advantage to be rapid because of the non-enzymatic but chemical extraction of streptococcal antigens.

TI  == the bifunctional peptidoglycan lysin of streptococcus agalactiae bacteriophage b30.
AB  == a group b streptococcal (gbs) bacteriophage lysin gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the purified recombinant enzyme, calculated to have a molecular mass of 49 677 da, lysed gbs cells. the susceptibility of gbs cells to  lysis by the enzyme depended upon the growth stage at which they were harvested,  with early exponential phase cells most sensitive. calcium ions enhanced the activity of the enzyme. the enzyme also lysed other beta-haemolytic streptococci, including groups a, c, e and g streptococci, but not common oral streptococci, including streptococcus mutans. the generation of both reducing activity and n-terminal alanine residues during lysis indicated that the lysin is a bifunctional enzyme, possessing both glycosidase and endopeptidase activities. this is consistent with the presence of two conserved sequence domains, an acm (acetylmuramidase) domain associated with lysozyme activity, and a chap (cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases) domain associated with endopeptidase activity. site-directed mutagenesis of conserved cysteine and histidine residues in the chap domain and conserved aspartate and glutamate residues in the acm domain confirmed their importance for lysozyme and endopeptidase activity respectively.

TI  == comparative genomics of streptococcal species.
AB  == microbial genome sequencing has produced an unprecedented amount of new information and insights into an organism's metabolic activities, virulence properties, and evolution. the complete genome sequence has been reported for four different species of streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae and s. mutans. comparative genome analysis among organisms of the same species not only shows a high degree of similarity in gene  content and organization, but also a high degree of sequence heterogeneity as evidenced by the large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms present. considerable differences were also observed in the number of mobile genetic elements found in each organism, including complete and partial bacteriophage genomes, is elements, transposons, and plasmids. s. pyogenes was the only species to contain complete bacteriophage genomes in its genome, while only s. pneumoniae and s. mutans contained the full complement of competence genes essential for natural transformation. comparative genome analysis between the species showed that s. pyogenes was more closely related to s. agalactiae than with s. pneumoniae or s. mutans.

TI  == the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections: from tooth decay to meningitis.
AB  == the development of bacterial disease has been likened to a 'molecular arms race', in which the host tries to eliminate the bacteria, while the bacteria try to survive in the host. although most bacteria do not cause disease, some cause serious human infection in a large proportion of encounters. between these two extremes are bacteria that can coexist with humans in a carriage state but, under appropriate circumstances, cause disease. the streptococci exemplify this group of organisms, and by studying them we can begin to address why bacteria cause such a wide spectrum of disease.

TI  == salivary agglutinin, which binds streptococcus mutans and helicobacter pylori, is the lung scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein gp-340.
AB  == salivary agglutinin is a high molecular mass component of human saliva that binds streptococcus mutans, an oral bacterium implicated in dental caries. to study its protein sequence, we isolated the agglutinin from human parotid saliva. after trypsin digestion, a portion was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms), which gave the molecular mass of 14 unique peptides. the remainder of the digest was subjected to high performance liquid chromatography, and the separated peptides were analyzed by maldi-tof/post-source decay; the spectra gave the sequences of five peptides. the molecular mass and peptide sequence information showed that salivary agglutinin peptides were identical to sequences in lung (lavage) gp-340, a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein family. immunoblotting with antibodies that specifically recognized either lung gp-340 or the agglutinin confirmed that the salivary agglutinin was gp-340. immunoblotting with an antibody specific to the sialyl le(x) carbohydrate epitope detected expression on the salivary but not the lung glycoprotein, possible evidence of different glycoforms. the salivary agglutinin also interacted with helicobacter pylori, implicated in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, streptococcus agalactiae, implicated in neonatal meningitis, and several oral commensal streptococci. these results identify the salivary agglutinin as gp-340 and suggest it binds bacteria  that are important determinants of either the oral ecology or systemic diseases.

AB  == we report the cloning, sequencing and expression analysis of the streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 hylb4755 allele, the first chromosomally-encoded streptococcal hyaluronate lyase gene to be cloned and sequenced completely. this  gene lies in a region homologous to that found in s. mutans, between the mutx and rmlb genes, a region involved in the synthesis of the serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen of this organism. sequencing of hylb4755 revealed a 3216-bp open reading frame that encodes a 121.2-kda polypeptide possessing a 30-amino acid signal sequence which was theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed. a recombinant plasmid, phyb100, containing hylb4755 together with its promoter and terminator was constructed and used to analyze the expression of the gene in escherichia coli. in northern hybridization experiments, hylb4755 was found to be transcribed as 3.3-kb monocistronic mrna from its own promoter which exhibits an extended, sigma70-like 10 consensus sequence. transcript mapping by primer extension analysis placed the major transcription initiation site leading to the longest transcript 38 bp upstream of the translational initiation codon, atg. e. coli tg1(phyb100) efficiently synthesized hyaluronan-cleaving enzyme activity at approximately 7000 working units/109 cells, with lyase activity detectable in all principle cellular locations. zymography and western analysis identified functional activity in tg1(phyb100) to be associated with approximately 118, 110 and 94-kda polypeptides, with the two low molecular weight species constituting the major components of the enzyme purified from the culture supernatant fluid of s. agalactiae 4755. the 118-kda form was shown to represent the undegraded mature enzyme, whereas the smaller species are likely to arise from proteolytic cleavage in the n-terminal part of the mature protein. the hylb4755 protein showed extensive sequence identity to the homologous enzymes from s. agalactiae 3502 and s. pneumoniae characterized by others but sequence comparisons clearly show that  incomplete genes truncated at their 5' ends had been isolated from these two organisms.

TI  == import and metabolism of glutathione by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == glutathione (gamma-glucysgly, gsh) is not found in most gram-positive bacteria, but some appear to synthesize it and others, including streptococcus mutans atcc  33402, import it from their growth medium. import of oxidized glutathione (gssg)  by s. mutans 33402 in 7h9 medium was shown to require glucose and to occur with an apparent km of 18+/-5 microm. gssg, gsh, s-methylglutathione, and homocysteine-glutathione mixed disulfide (hcyssg) were imported at comparable rates (measured by depletion of substrate in the medium), as was the disulfide of gamma-glucys. in contrast, the disulfide of cysgly was not taken up at a measurable rate, indicating that the gamma-glu residue is important for efficient transport. during incubation with gssg, little gssg was detected in cells but gsh and gamma-glucys accumulated during the first 30 min and then declined. no significant intracellular accumulation of cys or sulfide was found. transient intracellular accumulation of d/l-homocysteine, as well as gsh and gamma-glucys,  was observed during import of hcyssg. although substantial levels of gsh were found in cells when s. mutans was grown on media containing glutathione, such gsh accumulation had no effect on the growth rate. however, the presence of cellular  gsh did protect against growth inhibition by the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide. import of glutathione by s. mutans atcc 25175, which like strain 33402 does not synthesize glutathione, occurred at a rate comparable to that of strain 33402, but three species which appear to synthesize glutathione (s. agalactiae atcc 12927, s. pyogenes atcc 8668, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) imported glutathione at negligible or markedly lower rates.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == identification and characterization of a surface protein-releasing activity in streptococcus mutans and other pathogenic streptococci.
AB  == surface proteins of streptococcus mutans have been reported to be released into the culture filtrate at concentrations that vary with the growth conditions. the  reason for this is not clear. the present study attempts to investigate the mechanism of the protein release. the results showed that whole cells and raffinose-stabilized protoplasts of s. mutans ng8, when incubated in buffers, were capable of releasing their surface proteins in a ph-dependent manner with optimal release at ph 5 to 6. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the released proteins were very complex. two proteins, adhesin p1, which has been previously shown to interact with a human salivary agglutinin, and glucosyltransferase have been identified among the released proteins. the release of adhesin p1 and other proteins was found to be inhibited by heat, cu2+,zn2+, and thiol-blocking reagents. the inhibition by heat and cu2+ was irreversible, whereas that by the thiol-blocking reagents was reversible. edta, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and n-p-tosyl-l-lysyl-chloromethyl ketone had no effect on the release of p1, indicating that the release was probably not due to proteolytic activity. adhesin p1 from cu(2+)-inactivated s. mutans ng8 protoplasts could be released by mixing  with fresh whole cells and protoplasts, but not the culture filtrate, of a p1-negative mutant of ng8, suggesting that the enzyme is located on the cell surface. this p1-releasing activity was also detected in two other strains of s.  mutans and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, and s. pyogenes. the biological role(s) of this enzyme activity remains to be determined. however, owing to its ability to release virulent surface proteins from the cell, it may play an important role in cell surface modulation among the pathogenic streptococci.

TI  == intrageneric structure of streptococcus based on comparative analysis of small-subunit rrna sequences.
AB  == the partial 16s rrna sequences of 24 streptococcus species were determined by reverse transcription. a comparative analysis of these sequences and the sequences of seven previously studied streptococcal species revealed the presence of several clusters within the genus. the clusters obtained from the sequence analysis agreed in general with the groups outlined on the basis of the results of nucleic acid hybridization studies, but there were some exceptions. the pyogenic group was extended to include streptococcus agalactiae, s. parauberis, s. porcinus, and s. uberis. four oral groups were discerned; these four groups centered on s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, and s. oralis. some species (e.g., s. suis and s. acidominimus) did not cluster with any particular group. our findings are discussed in the context of data from other genetic and chemotaxonomic studies.

AB  == serum samples from patients with endocarditis due to streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus lactis and a "nutritionally" variant streptococcus were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all five species. in s mutans endocarditis there was an endocarditis specific pattern of igm against bands of 220, 200, and 190 kilodaltons. in s pneumoniae igm against antibody of a molecular weight greater than 150 kilodaltons was specific to endocarditis. in s agalactiae igm against bands at 82, 71, and 66-67 kilodaltons was endocarditis specific. in s lactis endocarditis specific igm was present against antigenic bands at 105, 66, 61 and  58 kilodaltons. with the "nutritionally" variant streptococcus it was impossible  to distinguish between cases of endocarditis and controls.

TI  == early response in neonatal septicemia. the effect of escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and tumor necrosis factor on the generation of lactoferrin.
AB  == using an in vitro model, we report the early effect of escherichia coli (e. coli), streptococcus agalactiea (group b streptococci, gbs) and recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf) on the release of lactoferrin (lf) and the generation of interleukin-1 (il-1) due to e. coli, using heparinized whole blood from healthy full-term newborns. we wanted to find a dose response relationship between lactoferrin generation on the one hand and the amount of e. coli, gbs and tnf on the other hand. in a final concentration of 10(7) per ml both bacteria increased the release of lf significantly. the response to e. coli was immediate  and mg/l +/- 0.29 mg/l, e. coli 1.83 mg/l +/- 0.76 mg/l, p less than 0.001). gbs  was a less potent stimulant than e. coli and the response was only apparent after 20 minutes (mean +/- s.d.: 1.06 mg/l +/- 0.49 mg/l, p less than 0.01). tnf in a concentration of 10000 pg/ml as well as 1000 pg/ml increased the release of lf significantly (after 20 minutes mean +/- s.d.: 1.09 mg/l +/- 0.42 mg/l and 0.97 mg/l +/- 0.36 mg/l, respectively), whereas a concentration of 100 pg/ml had no effect. whole blood incubated with different preparations of lf for 20 minutes did not increase the generation of lf significantly. no significant changes in il-1 levels were observed. lactoferrin had bacteriostatic but no bactericidal effect on gbs and streptococcus mutans.

TI  == use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (mnt) broth by various gram-positive cocci. the mnt broth consists of 0.5% trypticase (bbl microbiology  systems, cockeysville, md.), 0.5% yeast extract (difco laboratories, detroit, mich.), 0.2% l-norleucine, and 0.1% l-tyrosine. the microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. indolicus, p. magnus, and p. prevotii), staphylococcus spp. (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. saccharolyticus), and streptococcus spp. (s. agalactiae, s. intermedius, s. mutans, s. sanguis i, and s. sanguis ii). only peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in mnt broth cultures. all 11 p. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in mnt broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. this unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of p. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == polysaccharide storage in different streptococci.
AB  == calf serum, pooled human plasma, polyvinylpyrollidones (pvp) and polyethylene glycols (peg) were required as medium components by many cultures of group a.s. pyogenes for intracellular polysaccharide accumulation. these supplements produced a stabilizing effect, probably at the cell surface, and were not associated with nutrition during intracellular iodophilic polysaccharide (ips) storage. medium stabilization and the presence of maltose or maltose yielding polysaccharides was found to be a property unique to the group a streptococci. cariogenic streptococci and streptococcus agalactive did not require medium stabilization for ips storage although addition of pvp or peg was stimulatory. different degrees of ips storage in group a.s. pyogenes was found to be strain related and probably dependent on the size and degree of branching of the storage polymer.

AB  == the virulence of beta-hemolytic and non-hemolytic strains of streptococcus mutans was studied in neonatal mice by ld50 determinations after intracerebral injection of the bacteria. although the differences in ld50 values are small the results may indicate that beta-hemolytic s. mutans strains (mean ld50 of 6.3 x 10(7) c.f.u.) were more virulent than non-hemolytic s. mutans strains (mean ld50 of 47.7 x 10(7) c.f.u.). the ld50 values of other viridans streptococci varied between 4.8 and 10(7) c.f.u. strains of s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae were highly virulent in this animal model with ld50 values lower than 10(5) c.f.u.

TI  == streptococci and aerococci associated with systemic infection in man.
AB  == a collection of 820 isolates of streptococci and aerococci from human blood or internal organs was classified by means of a set of cultural and biochemical tests. of these, 719 (712 streptococci and 7 aerococci) were from patients believed to be suffering from a systemic infection: endocarditis 317; a purulent  lesion in an internal organ ("purulent disease") 152; bacteriaemia 250. the endocarditis streptococci included members of all recognisable taxa, but only certain of these were common: streptococcus sanguis, 16-4%; dextran-positive and  usually mannitol-fermenting strains of s. bovis (s. bovis i), 15-1%; s. mutans, 14-2%; s. mitior, 13-2%. streptococci of the "alpha-haemolytic" taxa (s. sanguis, s. mitior and related strains) formed only 44-8% of the total. when the percentage frequency of streptococcal taxa among the endocarditis and "non-endocarditis" isolates was compared, the dextran-forming taxa (s. mutans, s. bovis i, s. sanguis, and dextran-positive streptococci otherwise resembling s. mitior) all had higher "endocarditis : non-endocarditis" ratios than did any of the non-dextran-producing taxa. endocarditis increased in frequency with age, and showed an excess of males over females up to the age of 65 years. in young patients (less than 35 years), "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci predominated; with increasing age, the proportion of other streptococci increased progressively but  the absolute numbers of isolations of "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci did not fall. infections with s. mutans were prominent in the age-group 35-54 years and with s. bovis i at ages greater than or equal to 55 years. a history of previous  heart disease was more often obtained in endocarditis due to "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci than in other streptococcal endocarditis. the streptococcus most often isolated from purulent lesions in internal organs was s. milleri (29-3%). it was associated with brain abscess, meningitis, pleural empyema and a variety of intra-abdominal abscesses. the only common predisposing factor in endocarditis was previous heart damage. in other systemic streptococcal diseases, other general or local predisposing causes could be observed, mainly in infections with the "pyogenic" groupable streptococci, the enterococci and s. milleri.
