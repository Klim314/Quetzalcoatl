TI  == metabolic engineering of escherichia coli for biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) from glucose.
AB  == the escherichia coli xl1-blue strain was metabolically engineered to synthesize poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [p(3hb-co-3hv)] through 2-ketobutyrate, which is generated via citramalate pathway, as a precursor for propionyl-coa. two different metabolic pathways were examined for the synthesis of propionyl-coa from 2-ketobutyrate. the first pathway is composed of the dickeya dadantii 3937 2-ketobutyrate oxidase or the e. coli pyruvate oxidase mutant (poxb l253f v380a) for the conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionate and the ralstonia eutropha propionyl-coa synthetase (prpe) or the e. coli acetyl-coa:acetoacetyl-coa transferase for further conversion of propionate into  propionyl-coa. the second pathway employs pyruvate formate lyase encoded by the e. coli tdce gene or the clostridium difficile pflb gene for the direct conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionyl-coa. as the direct conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionyl-coa could not support the efficient production of p(3hb-co-3hv) from glucose, the first metabolic pathway was further examined. when the recombinant e. coli xl1-blue strain equipped with citramalate pathway expressing the e. coli poxb l253f v380a gene and r. eutropha prpe gene together with the r. eutropha pha biosynthesis genes was cultured in a chemically defined  medium containing 20 g/l of glucose as a sole carbon source, p(3hb-co-2.3 mol% 3hv) was produced up to the polymer content of 61.7 wt.%. moreover, the 3hv monomer fraction in p(3hb-co-3hv) could be increased up to 5.5 mol% by additional deletion of the prpc and scpc genes, which are responsible for the metabolism of  propionyl-coa in host strains.
