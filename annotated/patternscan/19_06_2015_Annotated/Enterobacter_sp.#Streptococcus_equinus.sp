TI  == the influence of endoscopic procedures upon the contamination of helicobacter pylori cultures.
AB  == background: among the various diagnostic methods for the detection of helicobacter pylori infection, histological examination and microbiological processing of gastric biopsy samples are assumed to be the gold standard techniques. aims: since h. pylori culture can be affected by the presence of non-h. pylori bacteria, we evaluated the efficacy of endoscope disinfection and the influence of endoscopic procedures on culture contamination. patients and methods: the procedures used during the first two routine endoscopies were evaluated during 28 consecutive days. endoscopy room, forceps and endoscopic channel were analyzed before and after the beginning of normal procedures. after  disinfection, a biopsy simulation was performed to verify the gastric bacteria. results: endoscope disinfection removed all organisms from forceps and endoscopic channel with 100% efficacy. the most frequent non-h. pylori bacteria detected were streptococcus bovis, enterobacter hormaechei, and staphylococcus aureus. the sensibility of the h. pylori culture was affected by the presence of non-h. pylori bacteria. conclusion: the risk of transmission of microorganisms was not detectable when sterilized biopsy forceps and stringent disinfection standards were employed. whilst s. bovis and e. hormaechei may be common in gastric microbial flora, the presence of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus indicated that the manipulation of biopsies could be responsible for culture contamination with these bacteria.

TI  == [infection by strongyloides stercoralis in the county of safor, spain].
AB  == background: strongyloides stercoralis is an endemic nematode in tropical and subtropical regions, but almost unknown in spain. patients and methods: in order  to know some epidemiological, clinical and analytic features of this infection in our area (la safor, valencia), we performed a prospective study for 19 months. through the search for the parasite in feces of patients with eosinophilia, we identified 37 subjects who were studied at diagnosis and 4 months later. results: thirty-three patients (89%) were currently, or had been agricultural workers, and thirty had worked barefooted and/or had drunk contaminated irrigation water. twenty-three patients (62%) had a chronic or immunosuppressive diseases, and two  of them on steroid treatment, developed a disseminated strongyloidiasis. thirteen patients (35%) were asymptomatic; the rest had clinical manifestations attributed s. stercoralis, mainly digestive. two of the patients with disseminated strongyloidiasis also had concomitant bacterial infections by streptococcus bovis, streptococcus faecalis and enterobacter sp. at diagnosis, besides eosinophilia, 86.5% had raised levels of ige. four months later treatment, the number of eosinophils was normal and ige levels significantly decreased. the diagnostic yield of parasitic study of feces was increased with the number of samples examined. thiabendazole achieved erradication of the parasite in 35 patients, and the other two died because of disseminated strongyloidiasis. conclusions: the presence of eosinophilia in patients from rural areas with subtropical climate should raise suspicion about infection by s. stercoralis, which, although sometimes is asymptomatic, may cause systemic bacterial infections in cases of hyperinfestation, specially when glucocorticoid treatment  is given.

TI  == [kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
