TI  == spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-clostridium activity from actinomadura sp. 2eps.
AB  == the rare actinomycetes strain 2eps was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell  wall, and 16s rrna gene sequence indicates that 2eps belongs to genus actinomadura. in addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the  relationships of this strain to other members of actinomadura. a butanol extract  with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. the structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)h-nmr and (13)c-nmr) and mass spectrometric analysis (hr-tof-ms). compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the japanese patent number jp 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are be-45722a (1), be-45722b (2) and be-45722c (3), respectively. all compounds were active against  gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, bacillus cereus atcc 14579, and b. subtilis atcc 6633) with low mic values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar mic values, against clostridium perfringens s107 at 0.63 microg/ml and c. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. these results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of clostridium infections. overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts of some acinos miller species.
AB  == gc and gc/ms analyses of the methanol extracts obtained from the aerial parts of  six acinos miller species from serbia and montenegro were performed. seventy-four constituents, accounting for 84.9-99.0% of the total composition of the extracts, were identified. the common feature of the a. suaveolens, a. majoranifolius and a. alpinus methanol extracts was the high content of monoterpenes, while the common feature of the a. graveolens, a. arvensis and a. hungaricus methanol extracts was the prevalence of sesquiterpenes. the total flavonoids, polyphenols  and tannins content, as well as antioxidant activity (frap and dpph assay) of the methanolic extracts were investigated. the highest antioxidant activity was observed in the extract of a. alpinus which had high levels of all polyphenol classes examined. a disk diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activities of the extracts against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria: bacillus subtilis, clostridium pyogenes, enterococcus sp., micrococcus flavus, sarcina lutea, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli; fungi: aspergillus niger, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae). the preliminary bioassay results indicated that the methanol extract of a. alpinus could be a possible source of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == potentialities of newly isolated bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus sp for curd  preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.
AB  == two bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16s rrna sequence profile as bacillus subtilis akl1 and by biochemical  process as lactobacillus acidophilus akl2. these isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (mother dairy and thackar) curds. the total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and  free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of akl1 and akl2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). the antioxidant activity against abts+, dpph8, oh* and fe3+ were  also higher in the newly formulated curd. polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in akl1+akl2. all these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by sds-page. the curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, shigella dysentery, vibrio cholerae and staphylococcus aureus. it can be concluded that the combination of these lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.

TI  == comparative study of different portuguese samples of propolis: pollinic, sensorial, physicochemical, microbiological characterization and antibacterial activity.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study four propolis samples from tras-os-montes region of portugal. the propolis samples' color was different, which pollen analysis showed to be due to different botanical sources: populus sp., pinus sp., quercus sp. and castanea sativa. the data from physicochemical analysis (moisture, soluble and insoluble solids content, ph, conductivity, ash content, wax, total phenolics and flavonoids content) was treated using multivariate statistical tools as cluster heat map, principal components analysis and linear discriminant analysis with the purpose of classifying the sample accordingly to the botanical/geographical origin. the discriminant analysis was applied with stepwise to select the variables that most contribute to sample identification accordingly to pollinic profile. the cross-validation technique was applied, using the leave-one-out procedure, which showed good prediction capabilities of the samples. microbiologically, the commercial quality was satisfactory, since the samples didn't contain deterioration or pathogenic microorganisms. all the samples studied presented antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, in a dose dependent way. the antimicrobial activity was strictly related to the physicochemical composition. this work will allow connecting a particular chemical propolis type to a specific type of biological activity, what is essential for the use in therapeutic applications.

TI  == bostrycin, a novel coupling agent for protein immobilization and prevention of biomaterial-centered infection produced by nigrospora sp. no. 407.
AB  == bostrycin, a red antibacterial agent with tetrahydroanthraquinone structure, has  been isolated from nigrospora sp. no. 407. this study investigated the potential  antibacterial and multifunctional properties of matrixes through immobilization of bostrycin on their surface for immobilization of protein and prevention of bacterial growth. bostrycin was immobilized on nonwoven polypropylene (pp) fabric by a technique using glutaraldehyde and polyethyleneimine for the activation of the surface. glucose oxidase immobilized on bostrycin-treated nonwoven pp fabric  showed high activity. the immobilization process improved thermal stability of the enzymes. during repeated assay for 30 cycles, the enzyme activity dropped to  only 70% of the initial activity. both bostrycin-treated nonwoven pp fabric sample and subsequently immobilized glucose oxidase sample on the surface also still exhibited a bacteriostatic effect. this is the first study to show that bostrycin is a promising coupling agent for surface modification on matrix and its potential applications in protein immobilization and biomaterial-centered infection.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == isolation of culturable microorganisms from free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (tursiops truncatus) from the southeastern united states.
AB  == reports of diseases in marine mammals are increasing worldwide, however our understanding of the microorganisms associated with marine mammals is still limited. in this study, we cultured bacteria and fungi isolated from the upper respiratory tract (blowhole), gastric fluid and anus of 180 wild bottlenose dolphins (tursiops truncatus) from two estuarine locations along the southeastern atlantic coast of the united states. a total of 339 and 491 isolates from charleston, sc (chs) and indian river lagoon, fl (irl) dolphins, respectively, were cultured from gastric (70 chs/82 irl), fecal (141 chs/184 irl), and blowhole (128 chs/225 irl) swabs on selective media used for routine clinical microorganisms of human concern. the most frequently cultured gram-negative bacteria from all sample and study types were plesiomonas shigelloides, aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas fluorescens. among the gram-positive bacteria, clostridium perfringens, bacillus sp., and staphylococcus coag. neg were the predominant organisms. for fungi, the most abundant species were candida glabrata, budding yeasts, and candida tropicalis. of concern, the mrsa strain of staphylococcus aureus was detected in the blowhole and gastric swabs from chs dolphins. in general, a greater prevalence of bacteria and fungi (four-fold increase) were cultured from irl than chs animals. together, these culture-dependent studies, coupled to on-going culture-independent approaches, should help establish a baseline of microorganisms associated with bottlenose dolphins and aid in the identification of organisms responsible for infectious diseases(s) in these animals.

TI  == uv disinfection of rbc-treated light greywater effluent: kinetics, survival and regrowth of selected microorganisms.
AB  == the microbial quality of raw greywater was found to be much better than that of municipal wastewater, with 1.6 x 10(7)cfu ml(-1) heterotrophic plate count (hpc), and 3.8 x 10(4), 9.9 x 10(3), 3.3 x 10(3) and 4.6 x 10(0)cfu 100 ml(-1) faecal coliforms (fc), staphylococcus aureus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa sp. and clostridium perfringes sp., respectively. further, three viral indicators monitored (somatic phage, host: escherichia coli cn(13) and f-rna phages, hosts:  e. coli f+(amp), e. coli k12) were not present in raw greywater. the greywater was treated by an rbc followed by sedimentation. the treatment removed two orders of magnitude of all bacteria. uv disinfection kinetics, survival and regrowth of  hpc, fc, p. aeruginosa sp. and s. aureus sp. were examined. at doses up to 69 mw  s cm(-2) fc were found to be the most resistant bacteria, followed by hpc, p. aeruginosa sp. and s. aureus sp. (inactivation rate coefficients: 0.0687, 0.113,  0.129 and 0.201 cm2 mw(-1)s(-1), respectively). at higher doses (69-439 mw s cm(-2)) all but hpc (which exhibited a tailing curve) were completely eliminated. microscopic examination showed that fc self-aggregate in the greywater effluent.  this provides fc an advantage at low doses, since the concentration of suspended  matter (that can provide shelter from uv radiation) in the effluent was very low. fc, p. aeruginosa sp. and s. aureus sp. did not exhibit regrowth up to 6h after exposure to increasing uv doses (19-439 mw s cm(-2)). hpc regrowth was proven to  be statistically significant in un-disinfected effluent and after irradiation with high uv doses (147 and 439 mw s cm(-2)). at these doses regrowth resulted from growth of uv-resistant bacteria due to decreased competition with other bacteria eliminated by the irradiation.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal  action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal  microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol,  were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == a review of outbreaks of foodborne disease associated with passenger ships: evidence for risk management.
AB  == objective: foodborne disease outbreaks on ships are of concern because of their potentially serious health consequences for passengers and crew and high costs to the industry. the authors conducted a review of outbreaks of foodborne diseases associated with passenger ships in the framework of a world health organization project on setting guidelines for ship sanitation. methods: the authors reviewed  data on 50 outbreaks of foodborne disease associated with passenger ships. for each outbreak, data on pathogens/toxins, type of ship, factors contributing to outbreaks, mortality and morbidity, and food vehicles were collected. results: the findings of this review show that the majority of reported outbreaks were associated with cruise ships and that almost 10,000 people were affected. salmonella spp were most frequently associated with outbreaks. foodborne outbreaks due to enterotoxigenic e. coli spp, shigella spp, noroviruses (formally called norwalk-like viruses), vibrio spp, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, cyclospora sp, and trichinella sp also occurred on ships. factors associated with the outbreaks reviewed include inadequate temperature control, infected food handlers, contaminated raw ingredients, cross-contamination, inadequate heat treatment, and onshore excursions. seafood was the most common food vehicle implicated in outbreaks. conclusions: many ship-associated outbreaks could have been prevented if measures had been taken to ensure adequate temperature control, avoidance of cross-contamination, reliable food sources, adequate heat treatment, and exclusion of infected food handlers from work.

TI  == microbiological quality of the bivalve pinctada imbricata commercialized in cumana, venezuela.
AB  == the habitual consumption of oysters in the city of cumana, venezuela, is made in  poor sanitary conditions, therefore a study was carried out to determine the sanitary quality of the product. for this, 120 samples of oyster pinctada imbricata were collected directly from: a) fishing boats (unhandled samples) and  b) after being shucked by the salesman (handled samples). unhandled samples showed the following mpn/g: faecal coliforms < 3 - 2.2 x 10, aeromonas sp. < 3 -  1.1 x 10(3), staphylococcus aureus < 3 - 7.5 x 10; clostridium perfringens < 3 -  9.3 x 10); cfu/g enterobacteriaceae 3 - 4.1 x 10(2); total aerobes 2.9 x 10(2) -  6.9 x 10(5); 6% of s. aureus were coagulase positive. values of mpn/g of handled  samples were higher: faecal coliforms 4 - 4.6 x 10(2); e. coli 9 - 2.1 x 10(2), aeromonas 3 - 4.6 x 10(2), s. aureus 2.3 x 10 - 4.6 x 10(2), c. perfringens < 3 - 2.8 x 10(2), and cfu/g counts of enterobacteriaceae 5.4 x 10 - 6.5 x 10(6), total aerobes 30 - 2.8 x 10(5); 25% of s. aureus were coagulase positive. salmonella sp. was detected in two of the handled samples. these results suggest contamination in growth areas of bivalve and during the collecting operation, which is increased by handling of the product by the salesman.

TI  == infective endocarditis in renal transplant recipients.
AB  == because of the increasing number of renal transplantations performed and the rarity of reported cases of infective endocarditis in these patients, we studied  the clinical characteristics of this infection in this population. we report on two cases from our experience and review reported cases of infective endocarditis in renal transplant recipients retrieved from the medline system. in addition, we reviewed a large series of infective endocarditis looking for patients with renal transplants. in addition to our 2 cases, 12 previously reported cases were found. the mean time from transplantation to diagnosis of infective endocarditis was 3.5 years (range 2 months to 15 years). causative organisms included fungi, staphylococcus aureus (3 cases each), corynebacterium sp. (2 cases), streptococcus viridans, vre, brucella sp., clostridium sp., nocardia sp. and erysipelothrix sp. (one case each). skin manifestations of endocarditis and/or splenomegaly were not reported in these patients. septic emboli and mycotic aneurysms were relatively common. the overall mortality rate was 50% (7 of 14 patients died). infective endocarditis seems to be rare in renal transplant recipients. the few reported cases are characterized by unusual causative micro-organisms and atypical clinical presentation. further studies are needed to delineate the magnitude and scope of this association.

TI  == spread of antibiotic resistance with food-borne pathogens.
AB  == this short review summarizes data on antibiotic resistance profiles of common food-borne pathogens like salmonella sp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. as a flashlight on the literature of the last few years, it provides ample evidence that antibiotic resistance traits have entered the microflora of farm animals and the food produced from them. molecular analysis of the resistance genes, where available, shows that the food microflora is not separated from its human counterpart and conjugative transfer of resistance genes has been demonstrated in vitro and in a few cases in vivo. for example, for salmonella typhimurium, resistance towards tetracyclines has increased from zero in 1948 to a 98% level in certain epidemic populations of s.  typhimurium dt104 in 1998. the high incidence of food-borne pathogens in raw meat and milk together with a high level of therapeutic, prophylactic and nutritional  application of antibiotics in agriculture reveals an antibiotic resistance problem of global dimensions. the resistance problem in human medicine will not be solved if there is a constant influx of resistance genes into the human microflora via the food chain.

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

TI  == the role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.

TI  == a randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  == febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a hickman line-associated infection. at 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol  violation or death due to other causes. a total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. the diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (34), hodgkin's disease  (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), escherichia coli (13), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), klebsiella sp. (3), enterobacter cloacae (2), streptococcus faecalis (2), ent. adenocarboxylata (1), clostridium septicum (1). strept. b (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and p. fluorescens (1), in-vitro testing showed that all  gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. there were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), strep. sangius (1), strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and p. maltophilia (1). both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. there is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. in view of the very high incidence of gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that  teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in  all febrile neutropenic patients.

TI  == a54145 a new lipopeptide antibiotic complex: microbiological evaluation.
AB  == a54145 complex is made up of eight factors; a, a1, b, b1, c, d, e, and f which were active in vitro (mic 0.25 approximately greater than 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive aerobic organisms. the complex, factor b and b1 were found  to be active against two strains of clostridium perfringens. a calcium dependence study on some of the factors showed that their in vitro antibacterial activity was greatly enhanced by the presence of calcium (50 mg/liter) in the media. resistance build-up was seen when staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp. were passed seven times in the presence of sublethal concentrations of a54145 antibiotics. this resistance disappeared immediately when the resistant organisms were passed in the absence of the antibiotics. factor a was very effective against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes infections in mice (sc ed50s of 3.3 approximately 2.4 mg/kg x 2, respectively). factor b was more active against s. pyogenes in vivo (sc ed50, 0.9 mg/kg x 2). acute mouse toxicities were determined with these antibiotics. semisynthetic derivatives were evaluated.

AB  == the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. according to the criteria of mccabe and jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. the clinical condition  of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or  good in 28. sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. the causative micro-organisms were: escherichia coli (18 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), salmonella sp. (seven episodes), enterobacter sp. (six episodes), proteus sp. (four episodes), serratia sp. (four episodes), haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), klebsiella sp. (three episodes), staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and morganella morganii (two episodes). overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). five organisms persisted: acinetobacter sp. (two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

TI  == detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

TI  == some factors affecting isolation of clostridium tetani from human and animal stools.
AB  == clostridium tetani was isolated from human and animal stools at the following rates [95% confidence interval (ci)]: human, 0% (1.5-0); horse, 1% (5-0); cow in  cowshed, 4% (10-1); cow in pasture, 8.3% (17-1), calf in pasture, 0% (7-0); dog,  2% (11-0) and sheep in pasture, 25% (44-14). quantification of c. tetani in 16 animal stools positive for the bacillus was impossible in most cases, as the number of tetanus bacilli present was not large enough for this purpose. contaminating anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria in human and animal stools, i.e., c. perfringens and streptococcus sp., group g, inhibited isolation  of c. tetani from these materials, particularly at the step of isolation employing its swarming character.

TI  == efficacy and safety of cefpirome (hr810).
AB  == sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and  joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were escherichia coli (6), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and haemophilus influenzae (1). one patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. in wound cultures, three strains of staphylococcus aureus and one each of ps. aeruginosa and str. faecalis persisted. one enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. of isolated strains, only str. faecalis and methicillin resistant staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. adverse  effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). tolerance was good. cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.

TI  == role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, compared to their number in the normal oral flora. studies of the pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria of the bacteroides, fusobacterium, and clostridium genera and afgpc are also presented. the organisms were inoculated into mice and their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses was determined. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas unencapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (less than 1%) survived in the abscess,  and became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or nonviable encapsulated bacteria. these strains were thereafter able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic cocci induced bacteremia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the unencapsulated form of the same strains. the relative importance of encapsulated anaerobes in relation to their aerobic and facultative counterparts in mixed infection was studied, using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice. with few exceptions, possession of a capsule made bacteroides sp. more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated bacteroides sp. and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and between most  afgpc and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

TI  == anaerobic osteomyelitis in children.
AB  == twenty-six pediatric patients with osteomyelitis caused by anaerobic bacteria are presented. the etiologic factors were chronic mastoiditis (7 patients), decubitus ulcers (5), chronic sinusitis (4), periodontal abscesses (3), bites (3), paronychia (2), trauma (1) and scalp infection after fetal monitoring (1). seventy-four organisms (2.8 isolates/specimen), including 63 anaerobes (2.4/specimen), and 11 facultative and aerobic bacteria (0.4/specimen) were recovered. the predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci (29 isolates), bacteroides sp. (21), fusobacterium sp. (8), streptococcus sp. (5) and clostridium sp. (4). the organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. these included all isolates of the bacteroides fragilis (4) and of staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 bacteroides oralis. the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.

TI  == the primary structure of thioredoxin from the filamentous cyanobacterium anabaena sp. 7119.
AB  == thioredoxin from the cyanobacterium anabaena 7119 serves as electron donor to ribonucleotide reductase and as a protein disulfide reductase. this small, heat-stable protein was found to have structural and functional similarities to thioredoxins from both bacterial and mammalian sources. we here report the complete primary structure of anabaena thioredoxin. the structure was determined  by analysis of peptides obtained after cleavage with cyanogen bromide, staphylococcus aureus protease, and trypsin. the protein consists of 106 residues with the following amino acid sequence: ser-ala-ala-ala-gln-val-thr-asp- ser-thr-phe-lys-gln-glu-val-leu-asp-ser-asp-val-pro-val-leu-val-asp-phe- trp-ala-pro-trp-cys-gly-pro-cys-arg-met-val-ala-pro-val-val-asp-glu- ile-ala-gln-gln-tyr-glu-gly-lys-ile-lys-val-val-lys-val-asn-thr-asp- glu-asn-pro-gln-val-ala-ser-gln-tyr-gly-ile-arg-ser-ile-pro-thr-leu- met-ile-phe-lys-gly-gly-gln-lys-val-asp-met-val-val-gly-ala-val-pro- lys-thr-thr-leu-ser-gln-thr-leu-glu-lys-his-leu. the sequence of anabaena thioredoxin shows a definite homology to the protein from escherichia coli, with  49% residue identities occurring in the proteins when aligned at the active site  disulfide.

TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

(mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  == a cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. it operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through  a short orifice. if the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. the disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by stansted fluid power limited, stansted, england. phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including chlorella, aspergillus fumigatis, fusarium sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus zooepidermicus and staphylococcus aureus. the cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. the applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. the case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.
