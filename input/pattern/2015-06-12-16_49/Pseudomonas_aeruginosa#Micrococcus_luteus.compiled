TI  - Candida and Fusarium species known as opportunistic human pathogens from customer-accessible parts of residential washing machines.
AB  - Energy constraints have altered consumer practice regarding the use of household  washing machines. Washing machines were developed that use lower washing temperatures, smaller amounts of water and biodegradable detergents. These conditions may favour the enrichment of opportunistic human pathogenic fungi. We focused on the isolation of fungi from two user-accessible parts of washing machines that often contain microbial biofilms: drawers for detergents and rubber door seals. Out of 70 residential washing machines sampled in Slovenia, 79% were positive for fungi. In total, 72 strains belonging to 12 genera and 26 species were isolated. Among these, members of the Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani species complexes, Candida parapsilosis and Exophiala phaeomuriformis represented 44% of fungi detected. These species are known as opportunistic human pathogens and can cause skin, nail or eye infections also in healthy humans. A machine learning analysis revealed that presence of detergents and softeners followed by washing temperature, represent most critical factors for fungal colonization. Three washing machines with persisting malodour that resulted in bad smelling laundry were analysed for the presence of fungi and bacteria. In these cases, fungi were isolated in low numbers (7.5 %), while bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Sphingomonas species prevailed.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of selected medicinal plants from lower Himalayas.
AB  - The present studies cover antibacterial activity of the crude methanolic extracts of 11 medicinal plants viz. Adhatoda vasica, Bauhenia variegate, Bombax ceiba, Carrisa opaca, Caryopteris grata, Debregeasia salicifolia, Lantana camara, Melia azedarach, Phyllanthus emblica, Pinus roxburghii and Olea ferruginea collected from lower Himalayas against two Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus) and two Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aureginosa) bacterial strains. The extracts were applied at four different concentrations (120 mg/mL, 90mg/mL, 60mg/mL and 30mg/mL) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by using agar well diffusion method. Antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus were observed formethanolic extracts of all the above mentioned plants. Greater antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was only exhibited by Phyllanthus emblica, Pinus roxburghii, Debregeasia salicifolia and Lantana camara. Escherichia coli was highly resistant to all the plant extracts at all concentrations. It is inferred that methanolic crude extracts of the above mentioned plantsexhibitantibacterial activities against pathogenic bacteria, which proved the ethnobotanical importance of the selected plants that indigenous people use for cure against various diseases.
TI  - One-pot multi-component synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridines using Zn(2+) @KSF and evaluating their antibacterial and antioxidant activities.
AB  - New 5-aryl-10-(4-(4-methoxyphenyl)thiazole-2-yl)-9,10-dihydropyrido[2,3-d:5,6-d']dipy rimidinone-2,4,6,8-(1H,3H,5H,7H)-tetraones 6a-d were synthesized through one-pot four-component reaction of aldehydes, barbituric acid, and thiazole using Zn(2+) @KSF under reflux condition. The key features of this reaction are: incorporating four heterocyclic rings, using a heterogeneous and efficient catalyst, high yield, and easy-to-setup reaction. The structure of the products was confirmed by FT-IR, (1)H NMR, and (13)C NMR spectra. The antibacterial activities of compounds 6a-d were screened against Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus bacterial strains using the zone inhibition method. Also, the 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities of compounds 6a-d were evaluated. All compounds showed good antioxidant capacity in comparison to ascorbic acid. The IC50 values of the antioxidant activity were calculated. The proposed mechanism for antioxidant activity is discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides expressed in medicinal maggots of the blow fly Lucilia sericata show combinatorial activity against bacteria.
AB  - The larvae of the common green bottle fly (Lucilia sericata) produce antibacterial secretions that have a therapeutic effect on chronic and nonhealing wounds. Recent developments in insect biotechnology have made it possible to use these larvae as a source of novel anti-infectives. Here, we report the application of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to characterize the transcriptomes of the larval glands, crop, and gut, which contribute to the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and proteins secreted into wounds. Our data confirm that L. sericata larvae have adapted in order to colonize microbially contaminated habitats, such as carrion and necrotic wounds, and are protected against infection by a diverse spectrum of AMPs. L. sericata AMPs include not only lucifensin and lucimycin but also novel attacins, cecropins, diptericins, proline-rich peptides, and sarcotoxins. We identified 47 genes encoding putative AMPs and produced 23 as synthetic analogs, among which some displayed activities against a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, and Enterococcus faecalis. Against Escherichia coli (Gram negative) and Micrococcus luteus (Gram positive), we found mostly additive effects but also synergistic activity when selected AMPs were tested in combination. The AMPs that are easy to synthesize are currently being produced in bulk to allow their evaluation as novel anti-infectives that can be formulated in hydrogels to produce therapeutic wound dressings and adhesive bandages.
TI  - Isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  - Endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. Tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. To clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. Based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16S rDNA full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: Bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), Staphlococcus aureus (33%), S. Epidermidis (75%), Micrococcus luteus (25%), Kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: Neisseria mucosa (58%), Streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: Enterococcus faecalis (17%), Lactococus lactis (33%), Escherichia coli (92%), Salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: S. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: N.mucosa (67%); anus: L. lactis (33%), E. coli (100%). These results indicate that S. epidermidis, N. mucosa, L. lactis and E. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, S. aureus, M. luteus, K. gibsonii, E. faecalis and S. typhosa were species-specific flora. This study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological activity of new mixed ligand complexes of Zn(II) naproxen with nitrogen based ligands.
AB  - A series of novel Zn(II) complexes [Zn2(nap)4] (1), [Zn(nap)21,10-phen](2), [Zn(nap)22,9-dmphen] (3), [Zn(nap)2(2-ampy)2] (4), [Zn(nap)2(imid)2] (5), [Zn(nap)2(1,2-dmimid)2] (6) (nap = naproxen, 1,10-phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,9-dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 2-ampy = 2-aminopyridine, imid = imidazole, 1,2-dmimid = 1,2-dimethyl imidazole) were synthesized and characterized using IR, UV-Vis, (1)H NMR, (13)C{(1)H} NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structure of complex 3 was determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In order to assess the effect of the metal ions on the anti-bacterial activity, complexes 1-6 have been screened in vitro, against (G(+)) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus) and (G(-)) bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli) using the agar well diffusion method. Complex 2 was the only complex that showed antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, where the complexation of the parent ligand 1,10-phenathroline enhanced significantly the activity. All the complexes showed different activity against the different bacteria, and were compared with activity of the parent ligands. The complexes were tested also for their anti-malarial activity using two methods: a semi-quantitative micro-assay and a previously self-developed quantitative in-vitro method. Both were used to study the efficiency of these complexes in inhibiting the formation of the Malaria pigment. This is considered an important target of many known anti-malarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Amodaquine. Results showed that the efficiency of complex 3 in preventing the formation of beta-hematin was 75%. The efficiency of Amodiaquine as a standard drug was reported to give 92.5.
TI  - Antibiotic oxylipins from Alternanthera brasiliana and its endophytic bacteria.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of Alternanthera brasiliana stem extracts resulted  in the isolation of an antibiotically active fraction. Five human pathogenic bacteria were used to guide the fractionation process for the isolation of antimicrobial compounds. Finally, 17 linoleate oxylipins were identified by LC-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. Five of the isolated compounds present in A. brasiliana tissues were also detected to be synthesized by endophytic bacteria of the genus Bacillus that were isolated from A. brasiliana. It is speculated that the antibiotic oxylipins from A. brasiliana might derive from bacteria and be involved in an ecological relationship between this plant and its endophytes.
TI  - Synthesis of novel benzimidazole functionalized chiral thioureas and evaluation of their antibacterial and anticancer activities.
AB  - A small library of benzimidazole functionalized chiral thioureas was prepared starting from natural amino acids (S)-alanine, (S)-phenylalanine, (S)-valine and (S)-leucine and also their (R)-isomers and studied their antimicrobial activity against a various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. In this study, compounds 5g and 5j were found to exhibit good antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella planticola, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the cytotoxicity study, thioureas derived from non-natural amino acids 5a-l showed good activity against human cancer cell lines A549, MCF7, DU145, HeLa, and no cytotoxicity was observed with their antipodes 6a-l.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles synthesized using Pulicaria glutinosa plant extract as a green bioreductant.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of nanoparticles (NPs) can be significantly enhanced by increasing the wettability or solubility of NPs in aqueous medium. In this study, we investigated the effects of the stabilizing agent on the solubility of silver NPs and its subsequent effect on their antimicrobial activities. Silver NPs were prepared using an aqueous solution of Pulicaria glutinosa plant extract as bioreductant. The solution also acts as a capping ligand. During this study, the antimicrobial activities of silver NPs, as well as the plant extract alone, were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus. Silver NPs were prepared with various concentrations of the plant extract to study its effect on antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, various concentrations of P. glutinosa extract did not show any effect on the growth of tested bacteria; however, a significant effect on the antimicrobial property of plant extract capped silver NPs (Ag-NPs-PE) was observed. For instance, the half maximal inhibitory concentration values were found to decrease (from 4% to 21%) with the increasing concentrations of plant extract used for the synthesis of Ag-NPs-PE. These results clearly indicate that the addition of P. glutinosa extracts enhances the solubility of Ag-NPs-PE and, hence, increases their toxicity against the tested microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial tetraoxygenated xanthones from the immature fruits of Garcinia cowa.
AB  - A phytochemical investigation of the acetone extract from the immature fruits of  Garcinia cowa led to the isolation of two novel tetraoxygenated xanthones, garcicowanones A (1) and B (2), together with eight known tetraoxygeanted xanthones. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus TISTR 688, Bacillus subtilis TISTR 008, Micrococcus luteus TISTR 884, Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 1466, Escherichia coli TISTR 780, Pseudomonas aeruginosa TISTR 781, Salmonella typhimurium TISTR 292 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. alpha-Mangostin showed potent activity (MIC 0.25-1 mug/mL) against three Gram-positive strains and garcicowanone A and beta-mangostin exhibited strong antibacterial activity against B. cereus with the same MIC values of 0.25 mug/mL.
TI  - Influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - The results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. To be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (DA) and molecular weights (MW) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. They were tested at different pH values for their antimicrobial activities against four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi), four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria solani). Chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (DA and MW) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. Considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower DA and the lower pH give the larger efficiency. Antibacterial activity was further enhanced for Gram-negative bacteria with decreasing MW, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the Gram-positive. Concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. Fungal growth decreased with increasing MW for F. oxysporum and decreasing DA for A. solani, but no MW or DA dependences were observed with A. niger.
TI  - Amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptides: membrane active peptidomimetics and their potential as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - We introduce a novel class of membrane active peptidomimetics, the amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptides, and evaluate their potential as antimicrobial agents. The design criteria, the building block and oligomer synthesis as well as a detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) study are reported. Specifically, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) was employed to investigate structural features of amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptide sequences at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic air/liquid interface. Furthermore, Langmuir monolayers of anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids have been used to model the interactions of amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptides with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular membranes in order to predict their membrane selectivity and elucidate their mechanism of action. Lastly, antimicrobial activity was tested against Gram-positive M. luteus and S. aureus as well as against Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa bacteria along with testing hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity. We found that amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptide sequences combine high and selective antimicrobial activity with exceptionally low cytotoxicity in comparison to values reported in the literature. Overall, this study provides further insights into the SAR of antimicrobial peptides and peptidomimetics and indicates that amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptides are strong candidates for further development as antimicrobial agents with high therapeutic index.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of water-soluble gold(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of water-soluble gold(I) complexes [1-methyl-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C1), [1-mesityl-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C2), [1-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C3) and [1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropyl-4-sodiumsulfonatophenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C4) and the respective ligands were assessed by agar diffusion and broth macrodilution methods against Gram-positives Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus and the Gram-negative bacteria Yersinia ruckeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Viability after treatments was determined by direct plate count. The bactericidal activity displayed by C1 and C3 was comparable to that of AgNO3.
TI  - Structure-activity study of macropin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the venom of solitary bee Macropis fulvipes (Hymenoptera: Melittidae).
AB  - A novel antimicrobial peptide, designated macropin (MAC-1) with sequence Gly-Phe-Gly-Met-Ala-Leu-Lys-Leu-Leu-Lys-Lys-Val-Leu-NH2 , was isolated from the venom of the solitary bee Macropis fulvipes. MAC-1 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, antifungal activity, and moderate hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. A series of macropin analogs were prepared to further evaluate the effect of structural alterations on antimicrobial and hemolytic activities and stability in human serum. The antimicrobial activities of several analogs against pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly increased while their toxicity against human red blood cells was decreased. The activity enhancement is related to the introduction of either l- or d-lysine in selected positions. Furthermore, all-d analog and analogs with d-amino acid residues introduced at the N-terminal part of the peptide chain exhibited better serum stability than did natural macropin. Data obtained by CD spectroscopy suggest a propensity of the peptide to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical secondary structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol or membrane-mimicking sodium dodecyl sulfate. In addition, the study elucidates the structure-activity relationship for the effect of d-amino acid substitutions in MAC-1 using NMR spectroscopy.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - Further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  - The antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide anion radical (.O2(-)), methoxy radical (.CH2OH), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.CO2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.NO) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.DPPH) radical. It reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising activity against .CO2(-), .CH2OH and .DPPH radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .NO, .O2(-) and .OH radicals (38%, 23% and 15%, respectively). The antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. To varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (MIC 0.003-0.038 mg/mL and MBC 0.013-0.052 mg/mL, MIC 0.008-0.016 mg/mL and MFC 0.090-0.520 mg/mL, respectively). According to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.
TI  - Taguchi's experimental design for optimizing the production of novel thermostable polypeptide antibiotic from Geobacillus pallidus SAT4.
AB  - Polypeptide antimicrobials used against topical infections are reported to obtain from mesophilic bacterial species. A thermophilic Geobacillus pallidus SAT4 was isolated from hot climate of Sindh Dessert, Pakistan and found it active against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Bacillus subtilis NCTC 10400 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 49189. The current experiment was designed to optimize the production of novel thermostable polypeptide by applying the Taguchi statistical approach at various conditions including the time of incubation, temperature, pH, aeration rate, nitrogen, and carbon concentrations. There were two most important factors that affect the production of antibiotic including time of incubation and nitrogen concentration and two interactions including the time of incubation/pH and time of incubation/nitrogen concentration. Activity was evaluated by well diffusion assay. The antimicrobial produced was stable and active even at 55 degrees C. Ammonium sulphate (AS) was used for antibiotic recovery and it was desalted by dialysis techniques. The resulted protein was evaluated through SDS-PAGE. It was concluded that novel thermostable protein produced by Geobacillus pallidus SAT4 is stable at higher temperature and its production level can be improved statistically at optimum values of pH, time of incubation and nitrogen concentration the most important factors for antibiotic production.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of resin rich plant extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The in vitro antibacterial activity of resin rich methanolic extracts (RRMEs) of Commiphora myrrha, Operculina turpethum, and Pinus roxburghii. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different concentration were studied by agar-well diffusion method against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae). RESULTS: Among all the bacterial strains tested, E. faecalis was most sensitive and S. typhi was resistant to C. myrrha and P. roxburghii. The extracts of O. turpethum were active against all tested strains in which B. subtilis and S. aureus were the most sensitive. CONCLUSION: This suggested that the antibacterial activity of RRMEs of O. turpethum was more than C. myrrha and P. roxburghii. This probably explains the potential of these plants against a number of infections caused by bacterial strains tested.
TI  - Antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities of five Palestinian medicinal plants.
AB  - Extracts from five indigenous Palestinian medicinal plants including Rosmarinus officinalis, Pisidium guajava, Punica granatum peel, grape seeds and Teucrium polium were investigated for antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities against eight microorganisms, using well diffusion method. The microorganisms included six bacterial isolates (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginos, Klebsiella pneumonia, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and two fungal isolates (i.e. Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger). A standard antioxidant assay was performed on the plant extracts to assess their capability in scavenging 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Of the five tested plant extract, only Rosmarinus offcinalis extract contained significant antimicrobial activity against all eight microbial isolates including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Extracts from other four plants exhibited a variable antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms, except Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Significant antioxidant activity was detected in all plant extracts. However, extracts from Pisidium guajava leaves contained significantly higher antioxidant activity compared to the other extracts tested. The antimicrobial and scavenging activities detected in this in vitro study in extracts from the five Palestinian medicinal plants suggest that further study is needed to identify active compounds to target diseases caused by a wide-spectrum pathogens.
TI  - Facile regioselective synthesis of novel bis-thiazole derivatives and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The design and synthesis of several new bis-thiazoles 4a-h serving as bis-drugs in comparison with mono-heterocyclic analogs are described. These bis-drugs present superior medicinal and pharmacological activities against both gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis) bacteria, which are in general more sensitive to compounds with higher hydrophobicity. Compounds with higher hydrophobicity (4d and 4h) exhibited some activity against the gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  - Mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (ET). It is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of VAP. Unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time VAP is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (SC). It is thus important to know whether these SC can predict the microbial flora in ET biofilms. In this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and of Candida albicans in cultures from ET biofilms and SC (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. Our data indicate that there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in ET biofilms and SC.
TI  - Harvestman phenols and benzoquinones: characterisation and biosynthetic pathway.
AB  - Benzoquinones are usually present in arthropod defence exudates. Here, we describe the chemical profiles of 12 harvestman species belonging to the neotropical family Gonyleptidae. Nine of the studied species produced benzoquinones, while three produced alkyl phenols. Two benzoquinones and one phenol exhibited biological activity against bacteria and fungi. We also studied the biosynthesis of 2-ethyl-1,4-benzoquinone by feeding Magnispina neptunus individuals with (1)(3)C-labelled precursors; the benzoquinones were biosynthesised through a polyketide pathway using acetate and propionate building blocks.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of bayberry leaf extract for the preservation of large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemical preservatives have been widely used to keep large yellow croaker fresh. However, the potential harm to human health cannot be ignored. This study was undertaken to investigate the antimicrobial effect of bayberry leaf extract and to evaluate the efficacy of this natural product on the preservation of large yellow croaker. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of bayberry leaf extract against bacteria were 1.0 mg mL(-)(1) for Micrococcus luteus, 0.5 mg mL(-)(1) for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg mL(-)(1) for Escherichia coli, 0.5 mg mL(-)(1) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.0625 mg mL(-)(1) for Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and 0.03125 mg mL(-)(1) for Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. This result was confirmed by the diameters of inhibition zone (DIZ) assay. Further studies showed that the bacterial growth was significantly retarded when large yellow croaker was pretreated with bayberry leaf extract (2 g L(-)(1)) compared to that in the control group. Moreover, the generation of total volatile basic nitrogenous compounds (TVB-N), ATP degradation products (K-value) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were significantly reduced compared to that in the control group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that the shelf life of large yellow croaker can be extended when supplemented with bayberry leaf extract, which might have implications for natural preservatives.
TI  - Aromatase and glycosyl transferase inhibiting acridone alkaloids from fruits of Cameroonian Zanthoxylum species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides and Z. leprieurii fruits are commonly used in traditional system of medicine for diarrhea, pain, wound healing, etc. in Cameroon, Africa. Z. leprieurii fruits have been chemically studied for its bioactive compounds whereas the investigation on Z. zanthoxyloides fruits is lacking. RESULTS: After a detailed chemical analysis of the fruits of Z. leprieurii and Z. zanthoxyloides, a series of new acridone alkaloids, namely, 3-hydroxy-1,5,6-trimethoxy-9-acridone (1), 1,6-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-9-acridone (2), 3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxy-1-methoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (3), 4-methoxyzanthacridone (8), 4-hydroxyzanthacridone (9), 4-hydroxyzanthacridone oxide (2,4') (10) have been isolated. The known acridones which have been characterized are, helebelicine A (4), 1-hydroxy-3-methoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (5), 1,3-dihydroxy-4-methoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (6) and tegerrardin A (7). The in vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic screening of these acridones reveal that compound 3 has a moderate antibacterial activity (MIC 125 mug/mL) against Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa while compound 1 shows a moderate cytotoxic effect (IC50 of 86 muM) against WRL-68 (liver cancer cell line). Furthermore, the molecular modeling of these acridones predicted the structural basis for their mode of action and binding affinity for aromatase, quinone reductase and WAAG, a glycosyltransferase involved in bacterial lipopolysaccharide synthesis. Computational approaches, quantitative SAR and modeling studies predicted that acridones 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10 were the inhibitors of glycosyltransferase while 1, 8, 9 and 10, the inhibitors of aromatase. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 10 acridones have been isolated out of which 6 are new (1, 2, 3, 8, 9 and 10). Alkaloids 8, 9 and 10, having novel tetracyclic acridone structure with new carbon skeleton, have now been named as zanthacridone. The quantitative SAR and molecular modeling studies suggested that the compounds 1, 9 and 10 are inhibitors of both aromatase and glycosyltransferase.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of bis-imidazolidineiminothiones: a comparative study.
AB  - A series of 15 novel symmetrical and non-symmetrical bis-imidazolidineiminothiones (6a-g, 7a-e, 8a,b, and 9) with various substituents at N-(1) (p-tolyl, p-methoxyphenyl, p-ethoxyphenyl, p-chlorophenyl, p-bromophenyl, p-iodophenyl, and 3,5-dichlorophenyl) and different linkers between the N-(3) atoms [4,4'-oxybis(4,1-phenylene), 2,2'-dimethoxybiphenyl, and (1,3,3-trimethylcyclohexyl)methyl)] were prepared in 65-75% yields from substituted N-arylcyanothioformanilides and various bis-isocyanates. Screening for cytotoxicity against the HEPG2, HEP2, MCF7, and HCT116 tumor cell lines gave IC50 values ranging from 6.3 to 84.6 microM, where compounds 6b,d,e,g and 7a were markedly active against a least one cell line, underlining the matching effect of properly positioned substituents on N-(1) and the appropriate N-(3)-N-(3) linker. Likewise, all heterocyles were tested against microbial organisms (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus pumilus, and Micrococcus luteus) and fungal strains (Candida albicans and Penicilium chrysogenum). Most compounds showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activities, reaching in certain cases the same level of antimicrobial activity as the standard antibacterial agent erythromycin and the antifungal agent metronidazole. The antimicrobial activity was further supported by quantitative assessment of susceptibilities of a selection of the preceding microorganisms using minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration techniques. Finally, the antiviral properties of all compounds were investigated against the viral strains HAV, HSV1, and CoxB4, where 6c,d,f and 7a,c,e were markedly active against one or two viral strains, reducing the virus plaque count of various viral strains by 66 to 88%. Structure activity relationship studies revealed several matching pairs of aromatic substituents on N-(1) and the N-(3)-N-(3) linkers, which could serve to optimize structural features for high activity to eventually render such compounds clinically useful drug agents.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial properties and chemical composition of rose petals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosa rugosa petals are used for production of teas, jams, wines and juices. Despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. RESULTS: Petals of R. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (HeLa) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines and for antiradical activity (with DPPH*). As a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (IC(5)(0) 1.33-0.08 mg mg(-)(1) DPPH*) were demonstrated. Moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. Staphylococcus. epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (Candida. albicans, C. parapsilosis) was shown. Total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. Five phenolic acids and six flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of R. rugosa petals.
TI  - Effective inhibition of bacterial respiration and growth by CuO microspheres composed of thin nanosheets.
AB  - This study describes the synthesis, characterization and biocidal potential of copper oxide micro-spheres composed of thin sheets (CuOMSs-Ths). Microscopic observations of synthesized CuOMSs-Ths revealed the clusters of thin sheets arranged in small flower like micro-spheres. Diameter of each micro-sphere was determined in the range of 2-3 mum, whereas the size of each sheet was approximately 80 nm. These micro-flowers like nanostructures were synthesized using copper nitrate hexahydrate and sodium hydroxide via solution process. The CuOMSs-Ths exhibited a broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity involving significant growth inhibition of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. The IC50 values of these engineered NPs against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and M. luteus were determined to be 195, 200, 131 and 184 mug/ml, respectively. Also, the respiration of Gram+ ve organisms (M. luteus and S. aureus) was inhibited significantly (p value < 0.005) at relatively lower concentrations of 12.5 and 50 mug/ml, respectively, as compared to the Gram- ve bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa), where the growth inhibition occurred at a much greater concentration of 100 mug/ml. The results explicitly demonstrated anti-microbial activity of CuOMSs-Ths with a higher level of toxicity against the Gram+ ve vis-a-vis Gram- ve bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity of 1-methyl-3-sulfonylthio-4-aminoquinolinium chlorides.
AB  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity (MIC) of novel 1-methyl-3-sulfonylthio-4-aminoquinolinium chlorides 2 are described. Compounds 2 were obtained in the reaction of 1-methyl-4-aminoquinolinium 3-thiolates 1 with sulfonyl chlorides. Antimicrobial activity of compounds 2 was investigated using Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtericum and Gram-negative Escherichia coil, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains as well as Candida albicans. The investigated compounds exhibited growth-inhibitory activity towards Gram-positive bacteria in the 4-64 microg/mL range whereas that towards Gram-negative bacteria covered the 128-1024 microg/mL range. The highest activity was shown by compound 2c, featuring a phenylsulfonylthio substituent in the 3-quinoline position and a 4-chlorophenylamine group in the position 4. All of the investigated compounds 2 showed antifungal activity in the 32-128 microg/mL range. Correlations between antimicrobial activity and chemical structure of the tested compounds were observed.
TI  - Phenolic Content, Antioxidant Activity, Antibacterial Activity and Phytochemical  Composition of Garcinia lancifolia.
AB  - Garcinia lancifolia (Clusiaceae) is an unexplored medicinal plant used as stomachic, diuretic and its fruit is used to cure dysentery and diarrhoea. The acidic fruits are used to prepare juice, pickle and curries. The phytochemical analysis of different extracts of G. lancifolia leaf, stem and fruit revealed the presence of tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids and cardiac glycosides. The high phenolic content was observed in the methanol extract of leaf followed by methanol extract of stem and dichloromethane extract of leaf. The G. lancifolia fruit juice exhibited high antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus subtilis. The methanol extract of fruit pulp was also very effective against Gram-positive bacteria when compared with Gram-negative bacteria. The radical scavenging activity of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl was highest in fruit juice followed by methanol extract of leaf and stem. All extracts showed concentration-dependent increase in the antioxidant activity.
TI  - New alkaloid from Streptomyces koyangensis residing in Odontotermes formosanus.
AB  - A new alkaloid was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the culture of a termite-associated Streptomyces koyangensis BY-4. The structure of 1 was elucidated by using MS, NMR, electronic circular dichroism data, and computational approaches. Compound 1 showed weak antimicrobial activities against a panel of test microbes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and phytochemical screening of Buchenavia tetraphylla (Aubl.) R. A. Howard (Combretaceae: Combretoideae).
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities and phytochemical constituents of hydroalcoholic extract and its fractions from Buchenavia tetraphylla leaves. Cyclohexane (BTCF), ethyl acetate (BTEF), and n-butanol-soluble (BTSBF) and non-soluble (BTNBF) fractions were obtained from a liquid-liquid partition of hydroalcoholic extract (BTHE) from B. tetraphylla leaves. The hemolytic activity of active fractions was checked. The BTHE inhibited the growth of Micrococcus luteus (MIC: 0.10 mg/mL), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC: 0.20 mg/mL), Mycobacterium smegmatis (MIC: 0.39 mg/mL), Proteus vulgaris, and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC: 0.78 mg/mL for both). The more active fractions were BTCF and BTBSF. BTCF showed better potential to inhibit M. luteus (0.10 mg/mL), P. aeruginosa (0.20 mg/mL), S. enteritidis (0.39 mg/mL), and S. aureus (1.56 mg/mL). BTBSF showed the best results for M. luteus (0.10 mg/mL), M. smegmatis, B. subtilis (0.39 mg/mL for both), and P. vulgaris (0.10 mg/mL). The HC50 were greater than observed MIC: 20.30, 4.70 and 2.53 mg/mL, respectively, to BTBF, BTHE and BTCF, which. The phytochemical analysis detected the presence of flavanoids, triterpene, carbohydrate, and tannin. Our work showed for the first time the broad-spread antimicrobial activity of B. tetraphylla, which has nonhemolytic action, creating a new perspective on the interesting association of traditional and scientific knowledge.
TI  - pH and Antimicrobial Activity of Portland Cement Associated with Different Radiopacifying Agents.
AB  - Objective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and pH changes induced by Portland cement (PC) alone and in association with radiopacifiers. Methods. The materials tested were pure PC, PC + bismuth oxide, PC + zirconium oxide, PC + calcium tungstate, and zinc oxide and eugenol cement (ZOE). Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar diffusion test using the following strains: Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. After 24 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C, inhibition of bacterial growth was observed and measured. For pH analysis, material samples (n = 10) were placed in polyethylene tubes and immersed in 10 mL of distilled water. After 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, the pH of the solutions was determined using a pH meter. Results. All microbial species were inhibited by the cements evaluated. All materials composed of PC with radiopacifying agents promoted pH increase similar to pure Portland cement. ZOE had the lowest pH values throughout all experimental periods. Conclusions. All Portland cement-based materials with the addition of different radiopacifiers (bismuth oxide, calcium tungstate, and zirconium oxide) presented antimicrobial activity and pH similar to pure Portland cement.
TI  - Lipopeptide biosurfactants from Paenibacillus polymyxa inhibit single and mixed species biofilms.
AB  - Although biofilms are recognised as important in microbial colonisation, solutions to their inhibition are predominantly based on planktonic assays. These solutions have limited efficacy against biofilms. Here, a series of biofilm-orientated tests were used to identify anti-biofilm compounds from marine micro-flora. This led to the isolation of a complex of anti-biofilm compounds from an extract of Paenibacillus polymyxa (PPE). A combination of rpHPLC and mass spectrometry identified the principle components of PPE as fusaricidin B (LI-FO4b) and polymyxin D1, with minor contributions from surfactins. This complex (PPE) reduced the biofilm biomass of Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus bovis. In contrast, ampicillin was only effective against S. aureus. PPE also inhibited a self-assembling marine biofilm (SAMB) in co-incubation assays by 99.3% +/- 1.9 and disrupted established SAMB by 72.4% +/- 4.4, while ampicillin showed no significant reduction. The effectiveness of this complex of lipopeptides against single and multispecies biofilms suggests a future role in biofilm prevention strategies.
TI  - Effects of parabens and isothiazolinone on the microbiological quality of baby shampoo: the challenge test.
AB  - An in vitro microbial challenge test has been developed to predict the likelihood of consumer contamination of baby shampoo. Four preservatives were tested in our study: the parbens Medcide D, Medcide PB, Sepicide HB. and isothiazolinone Methylisothiazolinone/Chloromethylisothiazolinone [MI/MCI]. These preservatives were tested separately and in combination. The challenge test involved inoculating the product with Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus brasiliensis and Candida albicans. Inhibition growth of these microorganisms at each preservative concentration was followed over a 28 d period. The test was used to classify products as poorly preserved, marginally preserved, or well-preserved. Interestingly, it was the combination (0.1% Isothiazolinone [MI/MCI] and 0.1% Sepicide HB) which inhibited most the microbial growth of microorganims while preserving the physicochemical properties of the product. As a result, the challenge test described can be accurately used to predict the risk of consumer contamination of cosmetic products.
TI  - A novel methylated sesquiterpene from seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation of chloroform extract from the leaves of the marine plant Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile (Posidoniaceae), yielded posidozinol, a new methylated sesquiterpene along with beta-sitosterol and four known fatty acids: palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic and linoleic acids. The structure elucidation has been established on the basis of 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy, GS/MS and ES mass spectrometry. Antibacterial effects of crude extracts from P. oceanica were evaluated against: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus microorganisms.
TI  - Crustins from eyestalk cDNA library of swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus: molecular characterization, genomic organization and expression analysis.
AB  - Crustins are cationic, cysteine-rich antimicrobial proteins, containing a single  whey acidic protein (WAP) domain in the C-terminal end. Different from the reported Ptcrustin in the hemocytes, two novel crustin genes (PtCrustin2 and PtCrustin3) were cloned completely from the eyestalk cDNA library of Portunus trituberculatus in this study. All PtCrustins share the consensus cysteine motif and are considered as Type I crustins. Four exons and three introns are identified in genomic DNA sequence of PtCrustin3 while three exons and two introns in PtCrustin2. The mRNA transcripts of PtCrustin2 and PtCrustin3 are mainly detected in eyestalk and gills, but not in hemocytes. Although both PtCrutins are up-regulated after challenge of three microorganisms, PtCrustin3 seems to respond more quickly to microbial challenge than Ptcrustin2. Unlike most crustins, both recombinant PtCrustin2 and PtCrustin3 exhibit antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus and Staphyloccocus aureus and Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, rPtCrustin2 is moderately active against yeast Pichia pastoris and rPtCrustin3 show significant activity against Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus. These results indicate that PtCrustin2 and PtCrustin3 are two novel crustins and play different roles in immune response of P. trituberculatus against microbial challenge.
TI  - A novel antibacterial and antifungal phenolic compound from the endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis mangiferae.
AB  - A novel phenolic compound, 4-(2,4,7-trioxa-bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-3-yl) phenol (1), was isolated from Pestalotiopsis mangiferae, an endophytic fungus associated with Mangifera indica Linn. The structure of the compound was elucidated on the basis of comprehensive spectral analysis (UV, IR, (1)H-, (1)(3)C- and 2D-NMR, as well as HRESI-MS). Compound (1) shows potent antibacterial and antifungal activity against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The transmission electron microscope study for the mode of inhibition of compound (1) on bacterial pathogens revealed the destruction of bacterial cells by cytoplasm agglutination with the formation of pores in cell wall membranes.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - An expeditious regioselective synthesis of novel bioactive indole-substituted chromene derivatives via one-pot three-component reaction.
AB  - Novel fused 1H-benzo[f]chromen-indole derivatives were synthesized regioselectivly in good to high yields by triethyl amine catalyzed condensation of 3-cyanoacetylindoles, beta-naphthol and aryl aldehydes in methanol under ultrasounic irradiations and conventional conditions. The easy work-up of the products, rapidity, and mild reaction conditions are notable features of this protocol. The antibacterial activity of the selected products was examined. Some products showed promising activities.
TI  - Ligational behavior of Schiff bases towards transition metal ion and metalation effect on their antibacterial activity.
AB  - New Schiff bases pyrazine-2-carboxylicacid (phenyl-pyridin-2-yl-methylene)-hydrazide (Hpch-bp) HL(1) and pyrazine-2-carboxylicacid (pyridin-2-ylmethylene)-hydrazide (Hpch-pc) HL(2) derived from condensation of pyrazine carboxylic hydrazide (Hpch) with 2-benzoyl pyridine (bp) or pyridine 2-carbaldehyde (pc) and their transition metal complexes of type ML((1-2)2) have been synthesized, where M=Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II). Characterization of ligands and their metal complexes was carried out by elemental analysis, conductimetric studies, magnetic susceptibility, spectroscopic techniques (IR, UV-VIS, NMR, ESR, Mass) and thermogravimetric analysis. The physico-chemical studies revealed octahedral geometry or distorted octahedral geometry around metal ion. These azomethine Schiff base ligands acted as tridentate coordinating through carbonyl, azomethine and pyridine nitrogen present in the ligand. The thermodynamic and thermal properties of the complexes have been investigated and it was observed on the basis of these studies that thermal stability of complexes follows the order Mn<Zn<Cu<Co<Ni. The ligands and their complexes were tested for in vitro antibacterial activity at different concentrations against bacteria viz. Gram positive Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mendocina. A marked enhancement in biocidal activity of the ligands under similar experimental conditions was observed as a consequence of coordination with metal ions. The trend of growth inhibition in the complexes was found to be in the order: Cu>Mn>Ni>Co>Zn.
TI  - Phenolic acids content, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of Ligusticum mutellina L.
AB  - A simple HPLC method has been used for separation and quantitative analysis of the phenolic acids in the methanolic extracts of Ligusticum mutellina aerial parts. Chlorogenic acid was the predominant phenolic acid. Additionally, gallic, p-OH-benzoic, caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids were identified. Moderate antibacterial and antifungal activity (MIC = 1.25-2.5 mg mL(-1)) was observed for the methanol extract of L. mutellina herb received from plants in flowering stage against a broad spectrum of bacteria. Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were the most sensitive to this plant material. Total phenolic content for the methanol extract of L. mutellina herb received from plants in flowering stage was 1.56 g of chlorogenic acid equivalents/100 g dry weight. The methanol extract of L. mutellina herb received from plants in flowering stage showed antioxidant activity with DPPH (IC50 value of 0.40 mg mL(-1)) and with ABTS (IC50 value of 8.65 mg mL(-1)).
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using latex from few Euphorbian plants and their antimicrobial potential.
AB  - The synthesis of well-dispersed and ultrafine metal nanoparticles has great interest due to their distinctive physicochemical properties and biomedical applications. This study is the first report of one-step solvent-free synthesis of AgNPs using Euphorbiaceae plant latex. Among evaluated eight latex-producing plants, four (Jatropha curcas, Jatropha gossypifolia, Pedilanthus tithymaloides, and Euphorbia milii) showed high potential to produce physicochemically distinct, small-sized and bactericidal AgNPs. Phytochemical screening showed presence of rich amount of biochemicals in these plants. J. gossypifolia showed uniformly dispersed comparatively small-sized AgNPs. Dose-dependent growth inhibition of bacterial pathogens Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Micrococcus luteus was observed for J. gossypifolia latex-synthesized AgNPs with minimum inhibitory concentration values 30, 40, 70, 60, and 60 ppm, respectively, after 24 h. Possible mode of action of AgNPs against pathogens was confirmed by analyzing enzymes and cell leakage.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Chinese bayberry extract for the preservation of surimi.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemical preservatives such as sodium nitrite and potassium sorbate have been widely used to keep surimi products fresh. However, the potential harmfulness to human health cannot be ignored. This study was conducted to develop natural preservatives for the storage of Collichthys surimi. RESULTS: Among the eight Chinese traditional herbs and fruits, Chinese bayberry extract showed the greatest inhibitory effect against surimi spoilage bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, N-butanol phase extract of bayberry (NB) showed the greatest activity among the different phases of bayberry extract. When Chinese bayberry extract was combined with tea polyphenol, an additive inhibitory effect was observed on growth of Hansenula anomala, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Our results further indicated that the shelf life of surimi products stored at room temperature can be extended when supplemented with Chinese bayberry extract. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Chinese bayberry extract can be used as a natural preservative for the storage of Collichthys surimi.
TI  - In vitro microbiological evaluation of 1,1'-(5,5'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(3-aryl-1H-pyrazole-5,1-(4H,5H)-diyl))diethanones, novel bisacetylated pyrazoles.
AB  - Novel 1,1'-(5,5'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(3-aryl-1H-pyrazole-5,1-(4H,5H)-diyl))diethanones 7-12 were tested for their antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion and twofold serial dilution method against the tested bacterial and fungal strains. Compounds 7 against Micrococcus luteus, 8 against beta-Heamolytic streptococcus, M. luteus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Microsporum gypseum, 9 against Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella flexneri, Vibreo cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus flavus, Mucor indicus, 10 against Salmonella typhii, S. flexneri, M. gypseum, 11 against K. pneumonia, M. gypseum, 12 against K. pneumonia, and M. gypseum show superior zone of inhibitions and exhibited excellent antibacterial and antifungal activities at a MIC value of 6.25 mug/mL. Moreover, all the tested compounds 7-12 revealed promising antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and INH-resistant M. tuberculosis. Compounds 8 against M. tuberculosis and 11 against INH-resistant M. tuberculosis exhibited the percentage of reduction in RLU at 89 and 85%, respectively.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of Hsp27.6: the first reported small heat  shock protein from Apis cerana cerana.
AB  - Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) play an important role in the cellular defense  of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms against a variety of internal and external stressors. In this study, a cDNA clone encoding a member of the alpha-crystallin/sHSP family, termed AccHsp27.6, was isolated from Apis cerana cerana. The full-length cDNA is 1,014 bp in length and contains a 708-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 236 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 27.6 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.53. Seven putative heat shock elements and three NF-kappaB binding sites were present in the 5'-flanking region, suggesting a possible function in immunity. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that AccHsp27.6 was expressed in all tested tissues and at different developmental stages. Furthermore, expression of the AccHsp27.6 transcript was induced by exposure to heat shock, H(2)O(2), a number of different chemicals (including SO(2), formaldehyde, alcohol, acetone, chloroform, and the pesticides phoxime and acetamiprid), and the microbes Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. In contrast, the mRNA expression could be repressed by CO(2), the pesticides pyriproxyfen and cyhalothrin, and the microbes Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Notably, the recombinant AccHsp27.6 protein exhibited significant in vitro molecular chaperone activity and antimicrobial activity. Taken together, these results suggest that AccHsp27.6 might play an important role in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses and in immune reactions.
TI  - In vivo antioxidative property, antimicrobial and wound healing activity of flower extracts of Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers. (Bignoniaceae), has been traditionally used as a remedy for treating white patches and infections on the skin (leukoderma, vitiligo). AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate wound healing and antimicrobial activity of flower extract of Pyrostegia venusta, including in vivo antioxidant activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic extracts of Pyrostegia venusta flowers were studied for wound healing efficiency along with its effect on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using excision and incision model of wound repair in Wistar rats. Healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, tensile strength, breaking strength, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content. Antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against twelve microorganisms was also assessed. In vivo antioxidant activity was performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. RESULTS: The results indicated that Pyrostegia venusta extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. Pyrostegia venusta extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Candida tropicana. During early wound healing phase TNF-alpha and IL-6 level were found to be up regulated by Pyrostegia venusta treatment. CONCLUSION: Increased wound contraction and tensile strength, augmented hydroxyproline and hexosamine content along with antioxidative activity and moderate antimicrobial activity support the early wound healing exhibited by Pyrostegia venusta flower extract. Induction in cytokine production may be one of the mechanisms involved in accelerating the wound healing by Pyrostegia venusta extract. Results suggest that Pyrostegia venusta may be useful in the tropical management of wound healing.
TI  - In vitro interaction of chronic wound bacteria in biofilms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use in vitro biofilm models of wound bacterial isolates and compare the biofilms produced for different combinations of wound bacterial species. METHOD: In vitro biofilms, generated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus oralis and Micrococcus luteus in microtitre plates and a constant depth film fermentor (CDFF), were studied. The tested isolates all originated from chronic venous leg ulcers. Biofilms of individual and dual combinations of these species were generated in microtitre plate wells at 37 degrees C for 24-96 hours and also in the CDFF for 7 days. The extent of biofilm formation from these systems was then measured using crystal violet staining and/or total viable counts. RESULTS: All the chronic wound bacteria formed biofilms (both individually and in mixed culture) in these models. In mixed species microtitre plate biofilms, both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus appeared to antagonise biofilm formation by S. oralis and M. luteus, with P. aeruginosa completely inhibiting the growth of these organisms. Similar effects were evident in the CDFF model, when all four bacterial species were added simultaneously, with M. luteus being 'out-competed' by the other organisms present and occurring at numbers at the limits of detection; however, there was an apparent increase in the numbers of S. oralis compared with its single culture equivalent. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted differences in biofilm formation ability for the tested species in both closed and open model systems. Using dual species biofilms, distinct species antagonism was observed with apparent antagonism of pathogenic species over 'commensal' ones. Such a finding provides insight into possible bacterial interactions during development of 'non-healing' wound biofilms.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial properties of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of non-polymeric phenolic (NP) and polymeric tannin (PT) constituents in the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of six brands of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total phenolic content (TPC) and ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) were assessed using the Folin-Ciocalteu and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays, respectively. Minimum inhibitory dose (MID) against Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, and Gram-negative. Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed using the disc-diffusion method. Teas were extracted with hot water successively three times for one hour each time. The extracts were fractionated using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography to obtain the NP and PT constituents. RESULTS: Extraction yields ranged from 12 to 23%. Yields of NP fractions (70-81%) were much higher than those of PT fractions (1-11%), suggesting that the former are the major tea components. Ranking of antioxidant properties of extracts was green tea>black tea>herbal tea. For all six teas, antioxidant properties of PT fractions were significantly higher than extracts and NP fractions. Extracts and fractions of all six teas showed no activity against the three Gram-negative bacteria. Green teas inhibited all three Gram-positive bacteria with S. aureus being the least susceptible. Black and herbal teas inhibited the growth of M. luteus and B. cereus, but not S. aureus. The most potent were the PT fractions of Boh Cameron Highlands and Ho Yan Hor with MID of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/disc against M. luteus. CONCLUSION: Results suggested that NP constituents are major contributors to the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of teas of C. sinensis. Although PT constituents have stronger antioxidant and antibacterial properties, they constitute only a minor component of the teas.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of novel 2,5-diphenylindolo[2,3-e] pyrazolo[1',5':3",4"]pyrimido[2",1"-c] [1,2,4]triazines.
AB  - The formation of (E)-3-{2-(2,5-diphenylpyrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin-7-yl)hydrazono}indolin-2-ones 3 has been achieved by condensation of equimolar amounts of 7-hydrazino-2,5-diphenylpyrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine (1) and isatin (or isatin derivatives) 2 at room temperature. The (E)-products could be isomerized into corresponding the (Z)-3 isomers. Reactions of the latter fused heterocyclic hydrazones towards different electro-philic reagents yielded the corresponding 3-substituted derivatives 4-7. Dehydrative cyclisation of the hydrazones 3 using phosphorus oxychloride afforded the 2,5-diphenyl- indolo[2,3-e]pyrazolo[1',5':3",4"]pyrimido[2",1"-c][1,2,4] triazines 13. The polyfused heterocyclic ring system 13 underwent electrophilic substitution reactions at position 4 rather than at position 3. The 3-bromo isomer of 17 was prepared by a sequence of reactions starting from 2,5-diphenylpyrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine-7(6H)-thione (11). The orientation of the electrophilic attack was supported by spectroscopic and chemical evidence. Some of the synthesized compounds were found to possess slight to moderate activity against the microorganisms Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity, and phytochemical screening of Voacanga globosa (Blanco) Merr. leaf extract (Apocynaceae).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, cytotoxic,  and phytochemical properties of ethanol extracts of leaves of Voacanga globosa (Blanco) Merr. (V. globosa). METHODS: The extracts were tested against bacteria and fungus through disc diffusion assay; against protozoa through growth curve determination, antiprotozoal and cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: The extract revealed antibacterial activities, inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus luteus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Antifungal assay showed that it inhibited Candida albicans. The antiprotozoal assay against Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica showed that V. globosa can inhibit the parasites, wherein the action can be comparable to metronidazole. With the in situ cell death detection kit, Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica exposed to V. globosa leaf extract was observed to fluoresce simultaneously in red and yellow signals signifying apoptotic-like changes. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the chemical composition of plant extract containing alkaloids, saponins, 2-deoxysugars, and hydrolysable tannins. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, this study provides scientific evidence on the traditional use of V. globosa leaf extract in treating microbial diseases. Further, the leaf extract can possibly be used to produce alternative forms of antimicrobials.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of some new carbazole derivatives.
AB  - In this work, some N-(9-Ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-2-(phenoxy)acetamide derivatives were synthesised and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity. The structural elucidation of the compounds was performed by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data and elemental analyses. The title compounds were obtained by reacting 2-chloro-N-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)acetamide with some substituted phenols. The synthesised compounds were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Candida albicans. The compounds N-(9-Ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-2-(4-ethylphenoxy)acetamide (2c) and N-(9-Ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-2-(quinolin-8-yloxy)acetamide (2n) showed notable antimicrobial activity. The compounds were also studied for their cytotoxic effects using MTT assay, and it was seen that 2n had the lowest cytotoxic activity against NIH/3T3 cells.
TI  - In vitro screening of Circium arvense for potential antibacterial and antifungal  activities.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of Circium arvense extracts were evaluated against two human gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus) and four gram negative pathogen (Escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae). The Methanol extracts of Circium arvense were used to obtain various fractions (X1) n-hexane, (X2) chloroform, (X3) ethyl acetate and (X4) n-butanol. The agar well diffusion assay and agar dilution susceptibility testing were carried out to determine the zone of inhibitions and the minimum inhibitory concentration respectively. Antifungal activity was employed by agar well diffusion method. The Ampicilline, Ofloxacine and Itraconazole were used as standard agents. Almost all fractions exhibited more or less antimicrobial activity. The X2 (Chloroform) fraction was reported as highly active fraction with good antimicrobial activity MIC 0.312 mg/ml against staphylococcus areous. The MBC values of fraction X2 (chloroform) was 2 times the MIC. Similarly all fractions exhibited good inhibitory activities against Aspergillus niger. The fraction X1(n-hexane) was found highly active 6(+/-0.11), followed by X2 (chloroform) fraction 5 (+/-0.17). Present study provides a base to explore the antimicrobial potential of Circium arvense. It is concluded that the Circium arvense having potential antibacterial and antifungal activities, irrespective of fact that the MIC values reported were high. Further investigations are recommended to exploit the hidden medicinal value of plant.
TI  - Phytochemical screening and antimicrobial activity of roots of Murraya koenigii (Linn.) Spreng. (Rutaceae).
AB  - Murraya koenigii, family Rutaceae, commonly known as Curry leaf plant is a highly valued plant for its medicinal value and characteristic aroma. The plant is a rich source of carbazole alkaloids. The petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of roots of the plant were screened for phytochemical properties and antimicrobial activity for Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Phytochemical screening showed the presence of carbohydrates, alkaloids, steroids and flavonoids in the root extracts of the plant. The study shows that all the extracts possess remarkable antibacterial activity. Additionally, petroleum ether and chloroform extracts also had antifungal activity.
TI  - Antagonistic intestinal microflora produces antimicrobial substance inhibitory to Pseudomonas species and other spoilage organisms.
AB  - Chicken intestine harbors a vast number of bacterial strains. In the present study, antimicrobial substance produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chicken was detected, characterized, and purified. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, the bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum vN. The antimicrobial substance produced by this bacterium was designated vN-1 and exhibited a broad-spectrum of activity against many important pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Erwinia amylovova. vN-1 was determined to be thermostable, insensitive to pH values ranging from 2.0 to 8.0, resistant to various organic solvents and to enzymatic inactivation. The inhibition kinetics displayed a bactericidal mode of action. This study revealed an antimicrobial substance with low molecular mass of less than 1 kDa as determined by ultrafiltration and having features not previously reported for LAB isolated from chicken intestines. The detection of this antimicrobial substance addresses an important aspect of biotechnological control agents of spoilage caused by Pseudomonas spp. and promises the possibility for preservation of refrigerated poultry meat. Practical Application: The newly characterized antimicrobial substance and designated as vN-1 may have the potential to be used in food preservation.
TI  - A new biphenyl and antimicrobial activity of extracts and compounds from Clusia burlemarxii.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation on Clusia burlemarxii (Clusiaceae) led to isolation and identification of nine compounds. Were isolated from leaves 3-O-alpha-L- rhamnopyranosylquercetin, 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosylkaempferol, 4-hydroxy-5,5-dimethyldihydrofuran-2-one, 2Z-delta-tocotrienoloic acid and friedelin and were isolated from trunk betulinic acid, protocatechuic acid, lyoniresinol, and a new biphenyl 2,2-dimethyl-3,5-dihydroxy-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chromane.

TI  - Antibacterial properties of the skin mucus of the freshwater fishes, Rita rita and Channa punctatus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The skin mucus of Rita rita and Channa punctatus was investigated to  explore the possibilities of its antibacterial properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Skin mucus was extracted in acidic solvents (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 3% acetic acid) and in triple distilled water (aqueous medium). The antibacterial activity of the mucus extracts was analyzed, using disc diffusion method, against five strains of bacteria--the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus; and the Gram negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi. RESULTS: In both Rita rita and Channa punctatus, the skin mucus extracted in acidic solvents as well as in aqueous medium show antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. Nevertheless, the activity is higher in acidic solvents than that in aqueous medium. The acidic mucus extracts of Rita rita, show antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhi as well. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that fish skin mucus have bactericidal properties and thus play important role in the protection of fish against the invasion of pathogens. Fish skin mucus could thus be regarded as a potential source of novel antibacterial components.
TI  - Antioxidant, electrochemical, thermal, antimicrobial and alkane oxidation properties of tridentate Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes.
AB  - In this study, two Schiff base ligands (HL(1) and HL(2)) and their Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II) and Ru(III) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. Alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. The ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). The antioxidant properties of the Schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. Electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.
TI  - Studies on interaction of colloidal silver nanoparticles (SNPs) with five different bacterial species.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (SNPs) are being increasingly used in many consumer products like textile fabrics, cosmetics, washing machines, food and drug products owing to its excellent antimicrobial properties. Here we have studied the adsorption and toxicity of SNPs on bacterial species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus barbaricus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The influence of zeta potential on the adsorption of SNPs on bacterial cell surface was investigated at acidic, neutral and alkaline pH and with varying salt (NaCl) concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 1.5 M). The survival rate of bacterial species decreased with increase in adsorption of SNPs. Maximum adsorption and toxicity was observed at pH 5, and NaCl concentration of <0.5 M. A very less adsorption was observed at pH 9 and NaCl concentration >0.5 M, there by resulting in less toxicity. The zeta potential study suggests that, the adsorption of SNPs on the cell surface was related to electrostatic force of attraction. The equilibrium and kinetics of the adsorption process were also studied. The adsorption equilibrium isotherms fitted well to the Langmuir model. The kinetics of adsorption fitted best to pseudo-first-order. These findings form a basis for interpreting the interaction of nanoparticles with environmental bacterial species.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Natural resistance of rose petals to microbial attack.
AB  - Petals of red, yellow and white roses (Rosa damascene Mill.) of the family Rosaceae were extracted with (1:1) methylene chloride/methanol and tested for their antimicrobial activities against four species of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus), five species of Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens) and five species of fungi (Penicillium notatum, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum). All of the crude extracts showed a wide range of antimicrobial activities according to the tested organism and rose's type. Micrococcus luteus was found to be the most susceptible bacteria to all crude extracts. Red and yellow petal extracts showed much higher antibacterial activity than the white petals extract. Bacillus subtilis was found to be the least susceptible to all extracts. The fungus, Penicillium notatum was found to be the most susceptible with white petal extract being the most effective. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum were the least susceptible to all extracts. White roses extract showed much higher antifungal activities against Penicillium notatum than red or yellow roses, therefore, it was subjected to several bioassay guided chromatographic fractionations and purification to isolate the active chemical(s) responsible for the antifungal activity. Chemical structure of the isolated antifungal compounds were identified by spectroscopy techniques and found to be a gamma-sitosterol and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. Antibacterial activity of the various types of rose extracts were due to complex mixtures of organic compounds which are still under chemical investigation and will be published later.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of novel oxadiazole derivatives.
AB  - In the present study, 5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazolin-2-thiones (1a-b) were synthesized via the ring closure reactions of appropriate acid hydrazides with carbon disulphide. N-(Benzothiazol-2-yl)-2-[[5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]sulfanyl]acetamide derivatives (3a-j) were obtained by the nucleophilic substitution reactions of 5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazolin-2-thiones (1a-b) with N-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-2-chloroacetamides. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data and elemental analyses. The synthesized compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Candida albicans. All compounds except compound 3h exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Among all compounds (3a-j), the compounds bearing 4-methoxyphenoxymethyl moiety on oxadiazole ring (3a-e) exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against C. albicans. Although compound 3j did not possess 4-methoxyphenoxymethyl moiety on oxadiazole ring, this derivative also exhibited the same level of anti-candidal activity. The compounds were also investigated for their cytotoxic effects using MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Compound 3a exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity, whereas compound 3g possessed the lowest cytotoxic activity against NIH/3T3 cells.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Greek endemic Stachys spruneri and its main component, isoabienol.
AB  - The essential oils of Stachys spruneri Boiss. (sample A and sample B) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. (+)-Isoabienol was the dominant component (49.5 and 48.2%, respectively of the total oils) among seventy-two identified constituents. Isoabienol was separated, purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, and further identified by means ofphysicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the essential oil and its main metabolite, the labdane diterpene isoabienol, were determined using the broth microdilution method against eight laboratory strains of bacteria (Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Gram- negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. Both essential oil and isoabienol showed considerable activity against all the microorganisms tested, with the isolated compound being most active.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro microbiological evaluation of novel diethyl 6,6'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(4-aryl-2-oxo-cyclohex-3-enecarboxylates).
AB  - Novel bis cyclohexenone ester derivatives 14-19 were synthesized and characterized by their spectral data. In vitro microbiological evaluations were carried out for all the novel compounds 14-19 against clinically isolated bacterial and fungal strains.

TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of raw and processed honey.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate extracts  of raw and processed honey was tested against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi). Both types of honey showed antibacterial activity against tested organisms with the zone of inhibition (ZOI) ranging from 6.94 to 37.94 mm, while E. coli, S. typhi, and P. aeruginosa showed that sensibility towards all the extracts with ZOI ranges between 13.09 to 37.94 mm. The methanol extract showed more potent activity than other organic extracts. Gram-negative bacteria were found to be more susceptible as compared to Gram-positive bacteria except E. faecalis. The broth microdilution assay gave minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) value of 625 mug/mL, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranges between 625 mug/mL 2500 mug/mL. The study showed that honey has antibacterial activity (bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect), similar to antibiotics, against test organisms and provides alternative therapy against certain bacteria.
TI  - Gram-negative and gram-positive antibacterial properties of the whole plant extract of willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium).
AB  - The emergence of new pathogens and the increase in the number of multidrug-resistant strains in well-established pathogens during the past decade represent a growing public health concern globally. With the current lack of research and development of new antibiotics by large pharmaceutical companies due to poor financial returns, new alternatives need to be explored including natural herbal or plant-based extracts with reported antibacterial properties. Willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium) preparations have been used in traditional aboriginal and folk medicine preparations externally as an antiphlogistic to treat prostate and gastrointestinal disorders and as an antiseptic to treat infected wounds. The authors hypothesized that a whole plant extract of willow herb would exhibit antimicrobial properties on a variety of both Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in culture. The authors found that, in comparison to growth controls, willow herb extract significantly inhibited the growth of Micrococcus luteus (p < .01), Staphylococcus aureus (p < .05), Escherichia coli (p < .001), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < .001). They also found that willow herb extract inhibited the growth of bacteria in culture more effectively than vancomycin (p < .05) or tetracycline (p < .004). These results provide preliminary support for the traditional folkloric claim that the plant willow herb possesses antibacterial properties against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Given that whole plant extract was utilized for this study, further investigations are warranted to determine which specific part of the plant (i.e., leaves, stem, roots, and flowers) possess the antibacterial properties.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anticancer efficacy of antineoplastic agent capped gold nanoparticles.
AB  - Synthesis of thioguanine (TG)-capped Au nanoparticles (Au@TG) and their enhanced  in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer efficacy against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger and Hep2 cancer cell (Human epidermiod cell) have been reported. The nature of binding between 6-TG and the gold nanoparticles via complexation is investigated using ultraviolet-visible spectrum, cyclic voltammetry, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The present experimental studies suggests that Au@TG are more potential than TG towards antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Hence, gold nanoparticles have the potential to be used as effective carriers for anticancer drug.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Enhanced antimicrobial activity of engineered human lysozyme.
AB  - Lysozymes contain a disproportionately large fraction of cationic residues, and are thereby attracted toward the negatively charged surface of bacterial targets. Importantly, this conserved biophysical property may inhibit lysozyme antibacterial function during acute and chronic infections. A mouse model of acute pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection demonstrated that anionic biopolymers accumulate to high concentrations in the infected lung, and the presence of these species correlates with decreased endogenous lysozyme activity. To develop antibacterial enzymes designed specifically to be used as antimicrobial agents in the infected airway, the electrostatic potential of human lysozyme (hLYS) was remodeled by protein engineering. A novel, high-throughput screen was implemented to functionally interrogate combinatorial libraries of charge-engineered hLYS proteins, and variants with improved bactericidal activity were isolated and characterized in detail. These studies illustrate a general mechanism by which polyanions inhibit lysozyme function, and they are the first direct demonstration that decreasing hLYS's net cationic character improves its antibacterial activity in the presence of disease-associated biopolymers. In addition to avoiding electrostatic sequestration, at least one charge-engineered variant also kills bacteria more rapidly in the absence of inhibitory biopolymers; this observation supports a novel hypothesis that tuning the cellular affinity of peptidoglycan hydrolases may be a general strategy for improving kinetics of bacterial killing.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of novel schiff bases of 3-amino-2-methyl  quinazolin 4-(3H)-one.
AB  - In the present study, novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes. The 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-one was synthesized from anthranilic acid via the 2-methyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by means of Infrared (IR), (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, Mass spectral, and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 11298)) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC 9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 46645) activities, using the paper disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by the agar streak dilution method. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(4-hydroxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4g and 4c was found to exhibit the highest anti-bacterial activity and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4k exhibited the highest anti-fungal activity.
TI  - Essential oil from the underground parts of Laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of Laserpitium zernyi Hayek (Apiaceae) were investigated. The pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). The main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. The antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against Gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram (-) bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (Candida albicans). L. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis, S. aureus and M. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
TI  - Monitoring the effects of chiral pharmaceuticals on aquatic microorganisms by metabolic fingerprinting.
AB  - The effects of the chiral pharmaceuticals atenolol and propranolol on Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus luteus, and Blastomonas natatoria were investigated. The growth dynamics of exposed cultures were monitored using a Bioscreen instrument. In addition, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy with appropriate chemometrics and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were employed in order to investigate the phenotypic changes and possible degradation of the drugs in exposed cultures. For the majority of the bacteria studied there was not a statistically significant difference in the organism's phenotype when it was exposed to the different enantiomers or mixtures of enantiomers. In contrast, the pseudomonads appeared to respond differently to propranolol, and the two enantiomers had different effects on the cellular phenotype. This implies that there were different metabolic responses in the organisms when they were exposed to the different enantiomers. We suggest that our findings may indicate that there are widespread effects on aquatic communities in which active pharmaceutical ingredients are present.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - Hydroxytyrosol from tyrosol using hydroxyphenylacetic acid-induced bacterial cultures and evidence of the role of 4-HPA 3-hydroxylase.
AB  - Hydroxytyrosol (HTyr) is a potent natural antioxidant found in olive mill wastewaters. Bacterial conversion of 4-tyrosol (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethanol) to HTyr was reported in a limited number of bacterial species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this work, we studied this conversion, taking as a model the newly isolated Halomonas sp. strain HTB24. It was first hypothesized that the enzyme responsible for 4-tyrosol hydroxylation in HTyr was a 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 3-hydroxylase (HPAH, EC 1.14.13.3), previously known to convert 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPA) into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (3,4-DHPA) in P. aeruginosa. Cloning and expression of hpaB (oxygenase component) and hpaC (reductase component) genes from P. aeruginosa confirmed this hypothesis. Furthermore, using cultures of HTB24 containing 4-tyrosol, it was shown that 4-HPA accumulation preceded 4-tyrosol hydroxylation. We further demonstrated that the synthesis of HPAH activity was induced by 4-HPA, with the latter compound being formed from 4-tyrosol oxidation by aryl-dehydrogenases. Interestingly, similar results were obtained with other 4-HPA-induced bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus and other Halomonas, thus demonstrating general hydroxylating activity of 4-tyrosol by the HPAH enzyme. E. coli W did not have aryl-dehydrogenase activity and hence were unable to oxidize 4-tyrosol to 4-HPA and HTyr to 3,4-DHPA, making this bacterium a good candidate for achieving better HTyr production.
TI  - Chemical composition, antifungal and antibacterial activity of the essential oil  of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis from Spain.
AB  - The chemical composition of the oil of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach. has been analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 34 compounds were identified representing more than 90% of the total oil. The oil was richer in monoterpenes than in sesquiterpenes, the major constituents being limonene (53.2%), 6-3-carene (21.0%) and a-pinene (12.2%). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the oil were also tested against Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp. and Serratia marcescens. Only two of these, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans, were sensitive to the treatment, inhibition zones of 11 and 14 mm diameter being obtained, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first report of the antifungal and antibacterial activity of this species.
TI  - Structure and applications of a rhamnolipid surfactant produced in soybean oil waste.
AB  - Soybean oil soapstock was utilized as an alternative carbon source for the production of rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI strain. The chemical composition and properties of the rhamnolipid mixture obtained were determined to define its potential applications. The chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid has revealed the presence of ten different homologues. The monorhamnolipid RhaC10C1) and the dirhamnolipid Rha2C10C10 were the main components of the mixture that showed predominance of 44% and 29%, respectively, after 144-h of cultivation. The biosurfactant was able to form stable emulsions with several hydrocarbons and showed excellent emulsification for soybean oil and chicken fat (100%). The rhamnolipid removed 67% of crude oil present in sand samples and presented antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Mucor miehei at 64 microg/mL and inhibition of Neurospora crassa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus at 256 microg/mL. The results demonstrated that the rhamnolipid produced in soybean oil soapstock can be useful in environmental and food industry applications.
TI  - Effects of stingless bee and honey bee propolis on four species of bacteria.
AB  - We examined the antibacterial activities of several types of propolis, including  Africanized honey bee green propolis and propolis produced by meliponini bees. The antibacterial activity of green propolis against Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus was superior to that of Melipona quadrifasciata and Scaptotrigona sp propolis. Only two samples of propolis (green propolis and Scaptotrigona sp propolis) were efficient against Escherichia coli. Melipona quadrifasciata propolis was better than green propolis and Scaptotrigona sp propolis against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We concluded that these resins have potential for human and veterinary medicine.
TI  - Report: antibiotic production by thermophilic Bacillus specie SAT-4.
AB  - Production of antimicrobial compounds seems to be a general phenomenon for most bacteria. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among key microbial pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide. Current solutions involve development of a more rationale approach to antibiotic use and discover of new antimicrobials. Bacillus species produce a large number of biological compounds active against bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. The process of production usually involves screening of wide range of microorganisms, testing and modification. Production is carried out using fermentation. Thermophilic spore-forming, gram positive, motile rod bacterial strains were isolated from the Thar Desserts, Sindh Province, Pakistan. These strains were screened and checked for antibacterial activity. The best activity was observed by SAT4 against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. The activity was only observed against gram positive bacteria and no activity was seen against Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Thermophilic Bacillus specie SAT4 was found to be active in the fermentation process to produce the antimicrobial agents. Further optimizations of different conditions (time of incubation, media, pH, glucose concentrations, nitrogen concentrations, and temperature) for antimicrobial production by the selected bacterial strain was performed. Agar diffusion assay was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity. Optimum conditions for the production of antimicrobials by selected isolate were observed to be 48 hour, pH 5, temperature 55 degrees C, 2% glucose and 1.5% nitrogen concentration. This newly isolated bacterial strain has great potential for antimicrobial production at industrial scale.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of six pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties and their relation to some of their pomological and phytonutrient characteristics.
AB  - Arils from six pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties grown in the Mediterranean region of Turkey were tested for their antimicrobial properties by the agar diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods against seven bacteria: (Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 9027, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Escherichia coli DM, Enterococcus faecalis A10, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971), and threefungi (Kluvyeromyces marxianus A230, Rhodotorula rubra MC12, Candida albicans ATCC 1023). It has been observed that the pomegranate aril extracts had antimicrobial effect on all microorganisms, giving inhibition zones ranging in size from 13 to 26 mm. The MIC values for active pomegranate extracts ranged between 30 and >90 microg/mL. The results obtained appeared to confirm the antimicrobial potential of the Punica granatum varieties.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Dodonaea viscosa using contact bioautography technique.
AB  - The crude ethanolic extract and n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous fractions of Dodonaea viscosa were analyzed for antibacterial potential against four Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Preliminary screening showed inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The thin layer chromatograms of the fractions were then subjected to contact bioautography, which showed inhibition zone at different R(f) values against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the presence of antibacterial components. The MIC of each fraction was determined through a 96-well micro-titer plate method. The non-viability of the organisms was ascertained by determining the MBC of the fractions.
TI  - Leptoglycin: a new Glycine/Leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the South American frog Leptodactylus pentadactylus (Leptodactylidae).
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. Here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of a novel neutral Glycine/Leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of Leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. The amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by RP-HPLC (C(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by Edman degradation: GLLGGLLGPLLGGGGGGGGGLL. Leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 8 microM, 50 microM, and 75 microM respectively, but it did not show antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (Microsporum canis and Trichophyton rubrum). No hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microM range concentration. The amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of Gly/Leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. Taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers based on calcium hydroxide and MTA.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a new root canal sealer containing calcium hydroxide (Acroseal) and the root canal sealer based on MTA (Endo CPM Sealer), in comparison with traditional sealers (Sealapex, Sealer 26 and Intrafill) and white MTA-Angelus, against five different microorganism strains. The materials and their components were evaluated after manipulation, employing the agar diffusion method. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar (MH) and wells were made by removing agar. The materials were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541). The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The results showed that Sealapex and its base paste, Sealer 26 and its powder, Endo CPM Sealer and its powder, white MTA and its powder all presented antimicrobial activity against all strains. Intrafill and its liquid presented antimicrobial activity against all strains except P. aeruginosa and Acroseal was effective only against M. luteus and S. aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antifungal activities of the extracts and essential oils of Bidens tripartita.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial and antifungal properties of the extracts, subextracts and essential oils of Bidens tripartita flowers and herbs. In the study, twelve extracts and two essential oils were investigated for activity against different Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, E. coli (beta-laktamase+), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL+), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and some fungal organisms Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. terreus using a broth microdilution and disc diffusion methods. The results obtained indicate antimicrobial activity of the tested extracts (except butanolic extracts), which however did not inhibit the growth of fungi used in this study. Bacteriostatic effect of both essential oils is insignificant, but they have strong antifungal activity. These results support the use of B. tripartita to treat a microbial infections and it is indicated as an antimicrobial and antifungal agent, which may act as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2% gel against ciclopirox and clotrimazole.
AB  - Commercially available topical formulations consisting of iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2%, ciclopirox 0.77%, and clotrimazole 1%-betamethasone dipropionate 0.5% were assessed for their antimicrobial activity against cultures of Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Corynebacterium aquaticum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Malassezia furfur, Microsporum canis, Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum, or Epidermophyton floccosum. At 1 and 5 minutes following inoculation into suspensions of each product, aliquots were removed, serially diluted, and plated onto appropriate agar to determine the log reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs) for each organism. Iodoquinol 1% produced the broadest and greatest antimicrobial activity as measured by a 3-log reduction of CFU, active against all microbes tested following incubation times of 1 or 5 minutes, except M luteus. By contrast, ciclopirox 0.77% and clotrimazole 1% showed activity against P aeruginosa and T rubrum, with ciclopirox also killing M luteus, P acnes, M canis, C albicans, and E floccosum at 5 minutes. Iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2% also was the only product that showed effective antibacterial reduction of MRSA at 1 minute.
TI  - Development of a simple and low cost microbioreactor for high-throughput bioprocessing.
AB  - A simple microbioreactor for high-throughput bioprocessing made from low cost polymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubes with a working volume of 1.5 ml is described. We have developed a microfluidic system that handles a small population of cells of a model microorganism, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DS10-129. Under the conditions of the microbioreactor, the organism produced extracellular secondary metabolites by using nutrient broth modified with glycerol. Pyocyanins were isolated from the fermented medium as a metabolite of interest. Antibiotic properties of pyocyanin were effective against a number of microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Batch fermentation of the model organism in the microbioreactor was compared to shake-flask and conventional bench fermenter methods. Results obtained from the microbioreactor compared favourably with the conventional processes.
TI  - Growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  - Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. Here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. All bacteria assayed induced a dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) mL(-1); except for M. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. In addition, Acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. Single-dose experiments indicated a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of M. luteus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. Long-term Acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including S. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the bacterium given, being much higher with E. coli, M. luteus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of Co(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalanine.
AB  - In this paper the first complexes of M(2+) ions (M(2+) = Zn(2+), Cd(2+) and Co(2+)) with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (1-3) are described. The new complexes were characterized by means of elemental analysis, IR and UV-vis spectroscopy, molar conductivity measurements and (1)H, (13)C and (15)N NMR spectroscopy (1D and 2D). The Co(II) complex adopts an octahedral geometry, and the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes adopt a tetrahedral one. For the first time, the antimicrobial activity of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (N-Boc-S-phe) and the complexes 1-3 was investigated against gram-positive: Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. It was shown that the complexes were effective against most strains. The best activity was detected against the yeast C. albicans.
TI  - Brassica juncea chitinase BjCHI1 inhibits growth of fungal phytopathogens and agglutinates Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Brassica juncea BjCHI1 is a plant chitinase with two chitin-binding domains. Its  expression, induced in response to wounding, methyl jasmonate treatment, Aspergillus niger infection, and caterpillar Pieris rapae feeding, suggests that it plays a role in defence. In this study, to investigate the potential of using BjCHI1 in agriculture, Pichia-expressed BjCHI1 and its deletion derivatives that lack one or both chitin-binding domains were tested against phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria. Transplastomic tobacco expressing BjCHI1 was also generated and its extracts assessed. In radial growth-inhibition assays, BjCHI1 and its derivative with one chitin-binding domain showed anti-fungal activities against phytopathogens, Colletotrichum truncatum, C. acutatum, Botrytis cinerea, and Ascochyta rabiei. BjCHI1 also inhibited spore germination of C. truncatum. Furthermore, BjCHI1, but not its derivatives lacking one or both domains, inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Ralstonia solanacearum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) more effectively than Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus megaterium), indicating that the duplicated chitin-binding domain, uncommon in chitinases, is essential for bacterial agglutination. Galactose, glucose, and lactose relieved agglutination, suggesting that BjCHI1 interacts with the carbohydrate components of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall. Retention of chitinase and bacterial agglutination activities in transplastomic tobacco extracts implicates that BjCHI1 is potentially useful against both fungal and bacterial phytopathogens in agriculture.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of some Schiff bases of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones.
AB  - In the present study, a series of novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes via cyclized intermediate 6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures were confirmed by means of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, Mass spectral and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC-155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC-4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC-11778, Escherichia coli ATCC-25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-11298) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC-9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC-46645) activities by paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylideneamino)-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one 10 was found to be the most potent anti-microbial activity with MICs of 18.9, 19.1, 18.8, 21.7, 18.2, 19.3, 16.7, 8.6 and 10.1 microg/ml against above mentioned respective strains. Compounds were found to exhibit more anti-fungal than anti-bacterial activity.
TI  - Constituents with independence from growth temperature for bacteria using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/differential mobility spectrometry with analysis of variance and principal component analysis.
AB  - Four bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus warneri,  and Micrococcus luteus, were grown at temperatures of 23, 30, and 37 degrees C and were characterized by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/differential mobility spectrometry (Py-GC/DMS) providing, with replicates, 120 data sets of retention time, compensation voltage, and ion intensity, each for negative and positive polarity. Principal component analysis (PCA) for 96 of these data sets exhibited clusters by temperature of culture growth and not by genus. Analysis of variance was used to isolate the constituents with dependences on growth temperature. When these were subtracted from the data sets, Fisher ratios with PCA resulted in four clusters according to genus at all temperatures for ions in each polarity. Comparable results were obtained from unsupervised PCA with 24 of the original data sets. The ions with taxonomic features were reconstructed into 3D plots of retention time, compensation voltage, and Fisher ratio and were matched, through GC-mass spectrometry (MS), with chemical standards attributed to the thermal decomposition of proteins and lipid A. Results for negative ions provided simpler data sets than from positive ions, as anticipated from selectivity of gas phase ion-molecule reactions in air at ambient pressure.
TI  - [The detection of bacteriogenic causes of opportunistic infections].
AB  - In order to select bacteriocin producing strains the screening of microorganisms  from clinical material was perfomed. The delayed antagonism method was used. 154 strains were screened, 93 (60%) cultures produced antagonistic substances. Micrococcus luteus NCTC, 2665, Candida albicans ATCC 885-653, Escherichihia coli 168/59, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27/99, Klebsiella peumoniae 1954 were used as test-cultures, Pseudomonas aenruginosa and Staphylococcys aureus were the most frequent species producing antibacterial substances and their products were of high potency, with a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Synthesis, structure and biological activities of cobalt(II) and zinc(II) coordination compounds with 2-benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - In this work we present the synthesis, structural and spectroscopic characterisation of a series of cobalt(II) and zinc(II) coordination compounds with benzimidazole (bz) and its 2-benzimidazole derivatives: 2-aminobenzimidazole (2ab), albendazole (abz) and tris(2-benzimidazolylmethyl)amine (ntb). The compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris. Their cytotoxic activity was also evaluated using human cancer lines, HeLa, HCT-15 and SKLU-1. The halide tetrahedral compounds [Co(bz)2Br2] 3, [Zn(2ab)2Cl2].0.5H2O 11, [Co(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 14, [Co(abz)Br2(H2O)] 15, [Zn(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 17 and [Zn(abz)Br2(H2O)].H2O 18 displayed similar minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values against Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli, comparable to those of amoxicillin and chloramphenicol. Additionally, 11 showed a wide range of activity towards Gram(+) and Gram(-) microorganisms. The tetradentate ntb and its trigonal bipyramidal cobalt(II) and zinc(II) compounds were active, regardless of the anion present in the complex. Compound [Co(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 14 showed promising activity in HeLa cells, while [Co(ntb)Br]Br.H2O 21 inhibited Hela and HCT-15 cell lines.
TI  - Characterization of Antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  - Five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various Antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. Twenty-two Antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis. None of the isolates inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus Candida albicans. Active Antarctic isolates, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the Actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-Proteobacteria (6 strains). Inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.Results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of Antarctic marine bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.
TI  - Verification of elicitor efficacy of lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans on antibacterial peptide gene expression in Bombyx mori.
AB  - We verified the efficacy of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in activating the cecropin B gene (CecB) in an immune-competent Bombyx mori cell line. Strong activation of CecB by the LPSs from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella minnesota were completely eliminated after digestion of the LPSs with muramidase. The results clearly indicate that a polymer form of PGN in the LPSs elicited CecB. An oligonucleotide microarray screen revealed that none of the 16,000 genes on the array were activated by LPS in the cells. In contrast, E. coli PGN strongly elicited five antibacterial peptide genes and numerous other genes, and PGN from Micrococcus luteus activated only several genes. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that all antibacterial genes activated by both PGNs, but the extents were 10-100 times higher with E. coli PGN. Similarly, higher elicitor activity of E. coli than M. luteus was indicated using peptidoglycan recognition protein gene, which is involved in pro-phenol oxidase cascade.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by Manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  - Although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. Here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. After being treated with Manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of Pichia pastoris was slightly affected. Microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and loss of cell mobility. Viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed E. coli and B. subtilis cells. Under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) were killed. In the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than L-dopa, N-acetyldopamine (NADA) or N-beta-alanyldopamine (NBAD) did, suggesting that DHI and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. The antifungal activity of DHI was detected using P. pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Beauveria bassiana. These results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (DCE)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial substances of low molecular weight isolated from the blowfly, Lucilia sericata.
AB  - Low molecular weight compounds were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography from the maggot or haemolymph extracts of Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae). Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, three compounds were obtained: p-hydroxybenzoic acid (molecular weight 138 Da), p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (molecular weight 152 Da) and octahydro-dipyrrolo[1,2-a;1',2'-d] pyrazine-5,10-dione (molecular weight 194 Da), also known as the cyclic dimer of proline (or proline diketopiperazine or cyclo[Pro,Pro]). All three molecules revealed antibacterial activity when tested against Micrococcus luteus and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the effect was even more pronounced when these molecules were tested in combination and caused lysis of these bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. The antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. The honey samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution. Most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of S. aureus even at 50% dilution. Undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. No inhibition of Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. The diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. This observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers, MTA-based cements and Portland cement.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different root-end filling materials - Sealer 26, Sealapex with zinc oxide, zinc oxide and eugenol, white and gray Portland cement, white and gray MTA-Angelus, and gray Pro Root MTA - against six different microorganism strains. The agar diffusion method was used. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar (MH) and wells were formed by removing the agar. The materials were placed in the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Escherichia coli (ATCC10538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541). The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride 0.05% gel was added for optimization, and the zones of inhibition were measured. Data were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests at a 5% significance level. The results showed that all materials had antimicrobial activity against all the tested strains. Analysis of the efficacy of the materials against the microbial strains showed that Sealapex with zinc oxide, zinc oxide and eugenol and Sealer 26 created larger inhibition halos than the MTA-based and Portland cements (P < 0.05). On the basis of the methodology used, it may be concluded that all endodontic sealers, MTA-based and Portland cements evaluated in this study possess antimicrobial activity, particularly the endodontic sealers.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of flexible endoscope disinfection in two Brazilian hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: [corrected] Endoscopes are routinely used in hospitals and clinics of the world and they can be potential sources of cross-infection when the decontamination process is unsuitable AIM: The routines of flexible endoscope (bronchoscopes, esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes) disinfection procedures used in two Brazilian university hospitals were evaluated during a 3-year period METHODS: Aleatory samples from internal channels of endoscopes were collected after patient examination and after cleaning/disinfection procedures RESULTS: A contamination >3 log10 was achieved in samples recovered from endoscopes after patient examination. These samples yielded gram-negative bacilli (n = 142: 56%), gram-positive cocci (n = 43: 17%), yeast cells (n = 43: 17%), and gram-positive bacilli (n = 26: 10%). Approximately, 72 out of 149 samples (48.32%) collected after undergoing the cleaning and disinfection procedures disclosed gram-negative bacilli (n = 55: 61%), gram-positive cocci (n = 21: 23%), gram-positive bacilli (n = 8: 9%) and yeast cells (n = 6: 7%). Esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes were the most frequently contaminated devices. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, Bacillus spp and Corynebacterium spp were predominantly identified CONCLUSION: Inappropriate cleaning and low times of disinfection were respectively the major factors associated with the presence of microorganisms in colonoscopes and esophagogastroduodenoscopes. By analyzing the identified germs, hospital disinfection was considered of either intermediate or poor level. After this investigation, both university centers improved their previous protocols for disinfection and conditions for reprocessing endoscopes.
TI  - A new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
AB  - The use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. A marine bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from Eal fish of Baluchistan coast of Pakistan. This strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. In this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of P. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. Based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio aliginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter faecium but it is not active against G streptococci, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger. Minimal inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg mL(-1) and for Gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg mL(-1).
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of different gutta-percha points and calcium hydroxide pastes.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different trademarks and compositions of gutta-percha points and calcium hydroxide pastes used in endodontic therapy. The evaluated material consisted of gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide (Roeko), gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine (Roeko), two conventional gutta-percha points (Endo Points and Roeko) and two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calen/PMCC). Antimicrobial tests included five species of microorganisms: Escherichia coli (ATCC10538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC12228), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), and Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341). The Agar diffusion method was employed. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel was added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. Statistical evaluation was carried out using analysis of variance and Tukey Test. The obtained results showed that all microbial species used in the study were inhibited by the gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine and by the calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calen/PMCC), with similar results (p > 0.05). No antimicrobial activity was observed for the other groups. It was concluded that the gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine presented antimicrobial activity, whereas the gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide did not.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and pollen composition of honey samples collected from different provinces in Turkey.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples from different sources were collected and investigated against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 27736, Morganella morganii, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4375, Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, and Candida albicans. Pathogens exhibited different sensitivities towards the honey samples. The results showed that majority of the honey samples (75%) generally inhibitied the bacteria tested. The honey samples which were obtained from Izmir (samples 1 and 2) proved more effective as inhibitors against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus. The honey which was obtained from Mugla (sample 5) exhibited high anticandidal activity on C. albicans. A comparison of the honey samples on the basis of pollen content revealed that they were heterofloral, and samples which had highest antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus were dominated by pollen from Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae (sample 1), and Trifolium, Trigonella, Cyperaceae, Zea mays and Anthemis taxa (sample 2). The honey proved more effective on bacteria than antibiotics.
TI  - Analytical detection and biological assay of antileukemic drug 5-fluorouracil using gold nanoparticles as probe.
AB  - Gold nanoparticles are reported and evaluated as probes for the detection of anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU). The nature of binding between 5FU and gold nanoparticles via complexation is investigated using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry, cyclic voltammetry, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The bound antileukemic drug is fluorescent and the quenching property of gold nanoparticles could be exploited for biological investigations. The 5FU-colloidal gold complex (Au@5FU) is observed to have appreciable antibacterial and antifungal activity against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus niger. The experimental studies suggest that gold nanoparticles have the potential to be used as effective carriers for anticancer drugs.
TI  - Synthesis of pseudopeptides based L-tryptophan as a potential antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Four compounds named L-BTrpPA, L-Trp-o-PA, L-Trp-m-PA and L-Trp-p-PA, pseudopeptides constructed from pyridine and tryptophan units, were synthesized and tested against the Gram-positive, Gram-negative strains of bacteria and human pathogenic fungi. L-Trp-o-PA proved to be a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, showing a significant inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus), and pathogenic fungi (Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhodotorula glutinis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus spp., Rhizopus nigricans) tested and activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) tested. The in vitro cell cytotoxicity of L-Trp-o-PA was evaluated using haemolytic assay, in which the compound was found to have low lytic property, even up to the concentration of 4000 microg/mL, it only lysed 6-7% of erythrocytes, which was 100-fold greater than the MICs (minimum inhibitory concentration).
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activities of Anthocephalus cadamba.
AB  - Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.) Miq. Syn A. chinensis (Lamk) A. Rich (Rubiaceae) is ethnomedicinally widely used in the form of paste by tribe in western Ghats for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobial potential of A. cadamba against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing. The alchoholic and aqueous extract of this plant showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four fungi Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum--dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus nidulans--systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that A. cadamba extract has potent wound healing capacity as shown from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that A. cadamba extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents from Salsola tetrandra.
AB  - The new norisoprenoid 3beta-hydroxy-5alpha,6alpha-epoxy-beta-ionone-2alpha-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside (1) and the long-chain hydroxy fatty acids 9,12,13-trihydroxyoctadeca-10(E),15(Z)-dienoic acid (2) and 9,12,13-trihydroxyoctadeca-10(E)-dienoic acid (3) were isolated from Salsola tetrandra aerial parts, together with 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (4), 9-hydroxylinaloyl glucoside (5), taxiphyllin (6), trans-N-feruloyltyramine (7), and S-(-)-trans-N-feruloyloctopamine (8). Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis and chemical methods. Compounds 6 and 8 displayed mild antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, whereas compound 6 showed the highest activity in the Artemia salina bioassay.
TI  - Synthesis, structure and biological activity of cobalt(II) and copper(II) complexes of valine-derived schiff bases.
AB  - We have synthesized two cobalt(II) 2 and copper(II) 3 complexes of valine-derived Schiff bases. The obtained complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR and X-ray diffraction. Biological studies of complexes 2 and 3 had been carried out in vitro for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and human pathogenic fungi. Compound 3 was proven to be a broad spectrum agent, showed a significant inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus), and pathogenic fungi (Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhodothece glutinis, Saccharomyces cerevisia, Aspergillus spp., Rhizopus nigricans) tested and a moderate activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes) tested. The in vitro cytotoxicity of compound 3 was evaluated using hemolytic assay, in which the compound 3 was found to be non-toxic to human erythrocytes even at a concentration of 500mug/mL.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch heartwood lignans.
AB  - Five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an MeOH extract from Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria Citrobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi Mucor miehei, Paecilomyces variotii, Ceratocystis pilifera, Trametes versicolor, and Penicillium notatum, and in addition, the MeOH extract was evaluated against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium moniliforme, F. sporotrichum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the Gram-positive. However, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of T. versicolor and C. pilifera at 300 and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the MeOH extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as T. versicolor, Fusarium spp. and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - Purification, characterization and comparison of reptile lysozymes.
AB  - Cation exchange column chromatography and gel filtration chromatography were used to purify four reptile lysozymes from egg white: SSTL A and SSTL B from soft shelled turtle (Trionyx sinensis), ASTL from Asiatic soft shelled turtle (Amyda cartilagenea) and GSTL from green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas). The molecular masses of the purified reptile lysozymes were estimated to be 14 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Enzyme activity of the four lysozymes could be confirmed by gel zymograms and showed charge differences on native-PAGE. SSTL A, SSTL B and ASTL had sharp pH optima of about pH 6.0, which contrasts with that of GSTL, which showed dual pH optima at about pH 6.0 and pH 8.0. The activities of the reptile lysozymes rapidly decreased within 30 min of incubation at 90 degrees C except for ASTL, which was more stable. Partial N-terminal amino acid sequencing and peptide mapping strongly suggested that the enzymes were C-type lysozymes. Interestingly, the mature SSTL lysozymes show an extra Gly residue at the N-terminus, which was previously found in soft-shelled turtle lysozyme. The reptile lysozymes showed lytic activity against several species of bacteria, such as Micrococcus luteus and Vibrio cholerae, but showed only weak activity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and lacked activity towards Aeromonas hydrophila.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - In vitro deposition of lysozyme on etafilcon A and balafilcon A hydrogel contact  lenses: effects on adhesion and survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare lysozyme adsorption and absorption and bacterial adhesion interactions on conventional (etafilcon A) and silicone (balafilcon A) hydrogel contact lenses. METHOD: Lysozyme concentrations and activities associated with the lenses were determined after solvent extraction (trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile) and directly on the lenses without extraction with micrococcal- and micro-bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assays. Cells of bacteria with radiolabeled leucine and a cell recovery procedure were used in determinations of bacterial adhesion to lenses. RESULTS: Lysozyme was adsorbed and absorbed to the conventional etafilcon A lens at about a 10-fold greater concentration than to the balafilcon A silicone hydrogel lens. Enzyme activities on the surfaces of both lenses were similar but replenished after saline extraction only with the etafilcon A lens. Lysozyme on the lens surface showed significant lysis of Micrococcus luteus but had a negligible effect on the adhesion and survival of Staphylococcus aureus. Lysozyme did not appear to affect the survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on lenses. CONCLUSION: In vitro experiments show that concentrations of active lysozyme on the surface of the etafilcon A lens, unlike the balafilcon A lens which showed negligible absorption, may be sustained from the lens matrix. Lysozyme deposited on hydrogel lenses had marked activity against M. luteus but relatively minor effects on the primary adhesion of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 2-arylbenzofurans from Morus species against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Nine 2-arylbenzofurans isolated from Morus species were tested for their antimicrobial activities against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among these compounds, chalcomoracin (a leaf phytoalexine of mulberry tree) exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against MRSAs (MICs 0.78 mug/ml).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens phage endolysin without holin conjugation.
AB  - To characterize the enzymatic activity and antibacterial activity of endolysin encoded by a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens phage, the open reading frame encoding endolysin was amplified by PCR and cloned into the expression plasmid pET21d(+). The resultant plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli JM109(DE3). Production of endolysin in the cytosol facilitated cell lysis without coproduction of holin, which is considered to degrade or alter the cytoplasmic membrane. The phage endolysin was overexpressed and purified. Although the specific activity of the purified phage endolysin towards lyophilized Micrococcus luteus cells was 1/11 of the activity of chicken egg white lysozymes, the endolysin showed stronger antibacterial activity towards E. coli W3110, E. coli JM109(DE3) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 than chicken egg white lysozymes. The antibacterial activity of the endolysin towards these three bacterial strains was marked when EDTA was added to the endolysin solution.
TI  - Purification of bovine milk lactoperoxidase and investigation of antibacterial properties at different thiocyanate mediated.
AB  - Bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO) was purified with amberlite CG 50 H+ resin, CM sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. The activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as a choromogenic substrate at pH 6.0. Purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with SDS-PAGE and Rz value (A412/A280). Rz value for the purified LPO was 0.8. Km value at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C for the LPO was 0.20 mM. Vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C. Bovine LPO showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Bacillus subtilis var. niger ATCC 10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Bacillus brevis FMC3, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 5, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Bacillus cereus EU, Bacillus megaterium NRS, Yersinia enterocolytica, Listeria monocytogenes scoot A, Bacillus megaterium EU, Bacillus megaterium DSM32, Klebsiella oxytocica, Staphylococcus aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis CCM 2067 and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as penicilline, ampicilline, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxon. The LPO--100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 system was purposed as an effective agent against many of the diseases causing organisms in human and animals.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate, Portland cement and EndoRez.
AB  - AIM: To determine in vitro the antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA), Portland cement and EndoRez on various species of microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: The diffusion method on Muller-Hinton agar (MH) was employed. A base layer was made using MH agar and five wells were made by removing agar at equidistant points. Sealers were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were seeded by pour plate. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Aliquots of 10 mL of 0.05% triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel were added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. RESULTS: Sealapex and Fill Canal demonstrated antimicrobial activity for all strains. For MTA and Portland cement, only E. coli was not inhibited. No antimicrobial activity was detected for EndoRez. CONCLUSIONS: In this laboratory study, Fill Canal, Sealapex, MTA and Portland cement presented antimicrobial activity whilst EndoRez did not.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions from cranberry juice.
AB  - The effect of anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-rich fractions isolated from cranberry juice was studied for their antibacterial activity against nine bacterial strains. Activity was assessed by the agar diffusion assay. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 was the only strain to exhibit some susceptibility to four out of 10 anthocyanin-rich fractions tested. A variable susceptibility of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 to proanthocyanidin- rich fractions was also observed. Streptococcus mutans strains as well as Escherichia coli ATCC 10538 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were not susceptible to any of the cranberry juice samples or fractions at the tested concentrations. There was no clear correlation between Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cranberry juice. In this work, the role of cranberry juice anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions upon bacterial viability is discussed.
TI  - Cecropin P1 and novel nematode cecropins: a bacteria-inducible antimicrobial peptide family in the nematode Ascaris suum.
AB  - Cecropin P1 was first identified as a mammalian antimicrobial peptide isolated from the pig intestine. Much research aimed at characterizing this peptide has been reported. Recently, the workers who discovered the peptide corrected their original conclusion, and confirmed that this peptide originates in fact from the pig intestinal parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum. In the present study, we carried out a semi-exhaustive search for bacteria-inducible transcripts in A. suum by the cDNA subtraction method. The transcripts encoding cecropin P1 and novel Ascaris cecropins, designated cecropins P2, P3 and P4, were found to be positively induced factors. Chemically synthesized Ascaris cecropins were bactericidal against a wide range of microbes, i.e. Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Esherichia coli) bacteria, and were weakly but detectably active against yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans). Cecropin P1-like sequences were also detected at least in two other species (Ascaris lumbricoides and Toxocara canis) of the Ascarididae. All Ascaris cecropin precursors contain an acidic pro-region connected by a tetra-basic cleavage site at the C-terminus. Such an acidic pro-region is also reported to be present in the tunicate cecropin-type antimicrobial peptide styelin. On the basis of the evolutionary position of nematodes and tunicates, the ancestral cecropin may have contained the acidic pro-region at the C-terminus.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria included in inoculants for silage  and in silages treated with these inoculants.
AB  - AIMS: To determine antibacterial activity in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) silage inoculants and in wheat and corn silages which were treated with these inoculants. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wheat and two corn silages were prepared in 0.25 l sealed glass jars. Inoculant treatments were prepared for each type of silage with each of 10 LAB silage inoculants at inoculation rate of 10(6) CFU g(-1). Untreated silages served as controls. Antibacterial activity was determined in the inoculants and in their respective silages with Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibacterial activity was detected in nine of the 10 inoculants whereas such activity in the silages varied. Control silages did not have antibacterial activity. CONCLUSIONS: Many LAB silage inoculants have antibacterial activity and in some cases this activity is imparted on inoculated silages. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted as part of a broader research objective, which is to find out how LAB silage inoculants enhance ruminant performance. The results of this study indicate that LAB silage inoculants produce antibacterial activity, and therefore, have a potential to inhibit detrimental micro-organisms in the silage or in the rumen.
TI  - [Interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. Neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland. The checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. The aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. Checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. In one case Salmonella Enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. Additive effects were predominant--49%. In 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations FIC indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. In combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. The best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial properties of some medicinal plants used in Iran.
AB  - Forty-five species of 29 plant families used in the traditional medicine by Iranian people, showed antibacterial activities against one or more of the bacterial species: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. No plant showed activity against Serratia marcescens; Bordetella bronchiseptica being the most susceptible species. All extracts showed the same activity 18 months later.
TI  - Resistance of rumen bacteria murein to bovine gastric lysozyme.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lysozymes, enzymes mostly associated with defence against bacterial infections, are mureinolytic. Ruminants have evolved a gastric c type lysozyme as a digestive enzyme, and profit from digestion of foregut bacteria, after most dietary components, including protein, have been fermented in the rumen. In this work we characterized the biological activities of bovine gastric secretions against membranes, purified murein and bacteria. RESULTS: Bovine gastric extract (BGE) was active against both G+ and G- bacteria, but the effect against Gram- bacteria was not due to the lysozyme, since purified BGL had only activity against Gram+ bacteria. We were unable to find small pore forming peptides in the BGE, and found that the inhibition of Gram negative bacteria by BGE was due to an artefact caused by acetate. We report for first time the activity of bovine gastric lysozyme (BG lysozyme) against pure bacterial cultures, and the specific resistance of some rumen Gram positive strains to BGL. CONCLUSIONS: Some Gram+ rumen bacteria showed resistance to abomasum lysozyme. We discuss the implications of this finding in the light of possible practical applications of such a stable antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Validation of microbial recovery from hydrogen peroxide-sterilized air.
AB  - The use of hydrogen peroxide as a sanitant in isolators and other barrier systems is well documented. To confirm that the isolator maintains a germ-free environment between decontamination cycles, microbiological air monitoring is performed after the sanitation and aeration cycles. In this study, we have shown that residual levels of hydrogen peroxide as low as 1 ppm can remain in the isolator and inhibit the growth of microorganisms after concentration on agar media. This lingering hydrogen peroxide can make accurate microbiological air monitoring difficult and can even cause false negative test results. To solve this issue, we have developed a new media that can mediate the effects of residual peroxide and prevent false negative test results. Initially, catalase was tested as a neutralizing agent but proved not to be efficient enough. Instead, 1% pyruvate was added, which was able to tolerate as much as 15 ppm Vaporous Hydrogen Peroxide (VHP) and ensured growth promotion of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. The 1% pyruvate retained its neutralizing activity for Micrococcus luteus at up to 100 ppm VHP. Raising the pyruvate concentration to 5% pyruvate enabled neutralization of up to 300 ppm VHP, permitting subsequent growth of Micrococcus luteus on agar media.
TI  - Microbial contamination of non-disposable instruments in otolaryngology out-patients.
AB  - Nosocomial infections are an important cause of morbidity and contaminated equipment may contribute to this. There has been little work concerning contamination of non-disposable equipment in Otolaryngology. This study investigates the efficacy of the cleaning regimen for non-disposable instruments in an Otolaryngology out-patients clinic. Instruments were swabbed before each clinic, when they had been autoclaved, then after use on patients, when they had been washed with detergent and chlorhexidine. Swabs of 86 instruments were cultured using standardized microbiological techniques. Fifteen instruments (17 per cent) were contaminated, most with coagulase negative staphylococci. Two specimens of Micrococcus luteus were cultured and one each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Aureobacterium spp. Micrococcus luteus and coagulase negative staphylococci may represent skin contaminants, but Aureobacterium spp. and Acinetobacter lwoffii can be sources of nosocomial infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a potentially serious pathogen and is implicated in the aetiology of otitis externa. These findings question the efficacy of the current cleaning techniques.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of fused Mannich ketones.
AB  - New Mannich ketones of fused bicyclic ketones as 1-indanones and 1-tetralones were prepared using the classical acid-catalysed Mannich reaction. Known members of this family were used in comparative biological tests. Antibacterial activity of these new water-soluble compounds was reported against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, E. coli ReD31m4, Salmonella minnesota Re595, Shigella sonnei Re4350, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis standard strains. Human cytotoxicity of our new compounds was evaluated against HeLa cell line. Some compounds showed low cytotoxicity (56.738 nM mL(-1) for 24, 47.497 nM mL(-1) for 31 and 48.379 nM mL(-1) for 26) and proved to be efficient antibacterial agents against the Gram-positive and partly against E. coli strains. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) changed in the range of 1.56->200 microg mL(-1). The deep rough mutants showed (generally eight times) higher sensitivity toward the compounds than the smooth E. coli. Hence, the permeability of Gram-negative outer membrane can influence the MIC values of our compounds. A preliminary quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study indicated the maximum positive charge (MaxQ(+)) as the parameter that most significantly affected antibacterial activity against E. coli. In B. subtilis, the influence of a topological descriptor (first-order valence-connectivity index, XV1) was also revealed; however, other strains did not yield meaningful QSAR with the set of descriptors employed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of licorice flavonoids against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Nineteen flavonoids isolated from licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra, G. inflata and G. uralensis) were tested for their antimicrobial activities against methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Activity of essential oils of three Micromeria species (Lamiaceae) against micromycetes and bacteria.
AB  - The chemical composition of essential oils from three Micromeria species: M. dalmatica Benth., M. albanica (Griceb. ex K. Mal) Silic and M. thymifolia (Scop.) Fritsch were investigated by GC and GC-MS and their antibacterial and antifungal activities against seven fungal and six bacterial species were evaluated. Biological assays showed strong fungitoxicity of oils from all three Micromeria spp., particularly M. albanica, against all fungi tested. Essential oils of these species also exerted antibacterial effect against Streptococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus at low concentrations. Higher concentrations of essential oil of M. albanica and M. dalmatica were active against Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which could be due to the high content of piperitenone oxide.
TI  - Synthesis and pharmacological activities of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives.
AB  - In the present study, a series of 2-substituted-4-methyl-7-amino/4,7-dimethyl-1,8-naphthyridines were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR and elemental analysis. The compounds were investigated for anticonvulsant (125, 250 mg/kg), cardiac and antimicrobial activities. The compounds were screened for antibacterial activity against gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcusfaecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and gram (-) bacteria (Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi). All the compounds except 2-(3'-phenylaminopropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine exhibited significant anticonvulsant activity. The anticonvulsant activity of 2-(3-morpholino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine, 2-(3'-diphenylamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine and 2-(3'-diethanolamino-propyloxy)-4,7-dimethy-1,8-naphthyridine at the dose of 250 mg/kg were found to be equivalent to diazepam (5 mg/kg). Sympathetic blocking activity was observed with 2-(3'-phenylamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine, 2-(3'-diethanolamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine and 2-(3'-diphenylamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine only. All the compounds were devoid of antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria.
TI  - Gas sensor arrays for early detection of infection in mammalian cell culture.
AB  - The detection of bacterial infections in a mammalian cell culture process is realised using a gas sensor array. In production-scale and laboratory-scale cultivations of a perfused recombinant CHO-cell culture producing human blood coagulation Factor VIII, we show that the gas sensor array identifies bacterial contamination earlier than conventional methods. The sensitivity of the instrument is verified by inoculation of a blank cell culture medium with defined bacterial cell counts.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--Endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% NaOCl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast Candida albicans. Activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. The base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of Muller Hinton Medium or 10.0 ml of Brain Heart Infusion agar in a Petri dish. After solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of Muller Hinton Medium or Brain Heart Infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. Absorbent paper disks (6.0 mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The candle jar system was used for the Brain Heart Infusion agar plates. All tests were performed in duplicate. After incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. Endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% NaOCl was effective only against S. aureus.
TI  - Enteric bacteria counteract lipopolysaccharide induction of antimicrobial peptide genes.
AB  - The humoral immunity of Drosophila involves the production of antimicrobial peptides, which are induced by evolutionary conserved microbial molecules, like LPS. By using Drosophila mbn-2 cells, we found that live bacteria, including E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, prevented LPS from inducing antimicrobial peptide genes, while Micrococcus luteus and Streptococcus equi did not. The inhibitory effect was seen at bacterial levels from 20 per mbn-2 cell, while antimicrobial peptides were induced at lower bacterial concentrations (< or =2 bacteria per cell) also in the absence of added LPS. Gel shift experiment suggests that the inhibitory effect is upstream or at the level of the activation of the transcription factor Relish, a member of the NF-kappaB/Rel family. The bacteria have to be in physical contact with the cells, but not phagocytosed, to prevent LPS induction. Interestingly, the inhibiting mechanism is, at least for E. coli, independent of the type III secretion system, indicating that the inhibitory mechanism is unrelated to the one earlier described for YopJ from Yersinia.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial study of unsaturated Mannich ketones.
AB  - Several Mannich ketones of 2-arylmethylenecycloalkanones were synthesised using the classical acid-catalysed Mannich reaction. Antibacterial activity of these new water-soluble compounds was reported against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis standard strains. Human cell line cytotoxicity of our new compounds was evaluated against HeLa cell lines. Some compounds showed low cytotoxicity (41.52 nM mL(-1) for 14 and 46.60 nM mL(-1) for 18) and proved to be efficient antibacterial agents against the Gram-positive strains. Minimum inhibitory concentrations varied from 1.56 to 100 microg mL(-1). The mechanism of action was examined, too.
TI  - Dicynthaurin: an antimicrobial peptide from hemocytes of the solitary tunicate, Halocynthia aurantium.
AB  - We isolated a novel antimicrobial peptide, dicynthaurin, from hemocytes of a tunicate, Halocynthia aurantium. The native peptide had a mass of approximately 6.2 kDa and was composed of two 30-residue monomers without sequence homology to any previously identified peptides (ILQKAVLDCLKAAGSSLSKAAITAIYNKIT). Most cynthaurin molecules were C-terminally amidated and were linked covalently by a single cystine disulfide bond. When performed in membrane-mimetic environments, circular dichroism studies of dicynthaurin revealed largely alpha-helical conformations. Dicynthaurin's broad-spectrum activity encompassed Gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but not Candida albicans, a fungus. Although dicynthaurin was purified from a marine invertebrate, its antimicrobial activity was optimal at NaCl concentrations below 100 mM. This suggests that the antimicrobial actions of this molecule may take place intracellularly (e.g., within a phagosome) rather than extracellularly.
TI  - Benzopyran derivatives from Mallotus apelta.
AB  - From the leaves of Mallotus apelta, seven benzopyran compounds were obtained and  their structures were determined using spectroscopic methods. One showed moderate antibiotic activity against Micrococcus lutens.
TI  - Ultrastructure of two oil-degrading bacteria isolated from the tropical soil environment.
AB  - Two oil-degrading bacteria identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Micrococcus luteus were isolated from crude-oil-polluted soils in Nigeria. The organisms were grown on n-hexadecane and sodium succinate and then examined for the presence of hydrocarbon inclusions. Inclusion bodies were found in n-hexadecane-grown cells and were absent in succinate-grown cells. Formation of hydrocarbon inclusion bodies appears to be a general phenomenon among hydrocarbon utilizers.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol isolated from Magnolia officinalis.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of Magnolia officinalis was investigated. The antimicrobial activity was assayed by the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined for each compound using a twofold serial dilution assay. The results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (MIC = 25 microg/mL) against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (MIC > or = 100 microg/mL) for Shigella flexneii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. Hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Degradation of anthracene by bacteria isolated from oil polluted tropical soils.
AB  - Four bacteria, identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alcaligenes eutrophus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus were isolated from crude oil polluted soils using anthracene as the sole carbon and energy source. All the organisms utilized n-hexadecane, n-tetradecane, diesel oil, engine oil and naphthalene as sole carbon sources. None could utilize hexane, cycloheptane, xylene, benzene, toluene, phenol, fluoranthene,and kerosene as carbon sources. Highest cell density obtained with 0.1% (w/v) anthracene were 4.5 x 10(7) (cfu/ml), 8.6 x 10(6) (cfu/ml), 5.4 x 10(6) and 2.4 x 10(6) (cfu/ml) respectively, for P. aeruginosa, A. eutrophus, B. subtilis and M. luteus after 30 days incubation. Growth of the organisms on a Nigerian crude oil resulted in a residual oil concentration of 22.2%, 33.3%, 39.3%, 44% and 91.7% respectively, for P. aeruginosa, A. eutrophus, B. subtilis, M. luteus and the noninoculated control on the 14 th day. Ring fission enzymes of the meta pathway were detected in induced cells of P. aeruginosa and A. eutrophus while ortho pathway enzymes were detected in B. subtilis and M. luteus. P. aeruginosa and A. eutrophus had specific catechol-2,3-dioxygenase activities of 3.8 +/- 0.183 and 0.64 +/- 0.032 micromol/min x mg protein respectively while catechol-1,2-dioxygenase activities of 1.95 +/- 0.029 and 1.89 +/- 0.026 micromol/min x mg protein were detected in B. subtilis and M. luteus respectively. This work, highlights the capability of these unreported tropical strains of A. eutrophus, B. subtilis and M. luteus as anthracene degraders.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, Ketac Endo, and Fill Canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. Seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541. There was a wild strain of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. Activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with Brain Heart Infusion agar and Muller Hinton medium seeded by pour plate. Calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% TTC gel and inhibition haloes were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. However, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, Enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by AH Plus, Fill Canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. We conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% TTC gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of Finnish plant extracts containing flavonoids and other phenolic compounds.
AB  - Plant phenolics, especially dietary flavonoids, are currently of growing interest owing to their supposed functional properties in promoting human health. Antimicrobial screening of 13 phenolic substances and 29 extracts prepared from Finnish plant materials against selected microbes was conducted in this study. The tests were carried out using diffusion methods with four to nine microbial species (Aspergillus niger, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis). Flavone, quercetin and naringenin were effective in inhibiting the growth of the organisms. The most active plant extracts were purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.) against Candida albicans, meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria (L.) Maxim.), willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium L.), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus L.) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) against bacteria, and white birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.), pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum. L.) against gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Protective effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene on para-nonylphenol-induced inhibition of cell growth, cellular respiration and glucose-induced proton extrusion of bacteria.
AB  - para-Nonylphenol (NP) showed a dose-dependent inhibition against the cell growth  of Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus at 5-100 microM. However, other typical plastic-derived endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol A and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) did not significantly affect the cell growth of these bacteria at 5-100 microM. The NP-induced cell growth inhibition was restored when concomitantly supplemented with lipophilic antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, but not with hydrophilic antioxidants, ascorbic acid and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). NP also suppressed in a dose-dependent manner cellular oxygen consumption and glucose-induced proton extrusion of these bacteria at 10-100 microM. Both effects were prevented when added with alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, but not with ascorbic acid and EGCG. The significance of these results is discussed from the viewpoint of environmental microbiology and a possible biochemical mechanism of the inhibitory effect of NP is suggested.
TI  - Design and synthesis of novel antimicrobial pseudopeptides with selective membrane-perturbation activity.
AB  - By incorporating carbamate bond(s) into a cytolytic peptide, novel pseudopeptides with potent antibacterial activity and low hemolytic activity were synthesized. Circular dichroism spectra suggested that the incorporation of carbamate bond(s) decrease the alpha helical conformation of the peptide in lipid membrane circumstances, which must be regarded as a major factor for the separation of antibacterial activity from cytotoxic activity for mammalian cell. Experiments in which dye was released from vesicles indicated that the potent antibacterial activity and low hemolytic activity of the pseudopeptides must be due to their great lipid membrane selectivity. The present result suggest that backbone modifications can be a great tool for developing pseudopeptides with improved biological activity and bioavailability from cytolytic peptides.
TI  - Effect of chelators and nisin produced in situ on inhibition and inactivation of  gram negatives.
AB  - The ability of chelators and nisin generated in situ to inhibit and inactivate E. coli and other gram negatives in a model substrate was investigated. The effect of various chelators and different concentrations of exogenous nisin on inhibition of E. coli in broth medium showed that only EDTA and pyrophosphates were able to cause appreciable inhibition of E. coli by nisin. In a broth where L. lactis NCFB 497 produced nisin in a concentration of 250-300 IU/ml, pyrophosphates were unable to inactivate E. coli. Under the same conditions, addition of EDTA led to inactivation of E. coli at neutral and slightly acidic pH only. A cocktail of strains of E. coli was less sensitive than E. coli ATCC 25922 alone. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more sensitive and salmonellae more resistant. EDTA also caused a slight reduction in the L. lactis population and its biochemical activity as regards pH drop and acid production. Some of the inhibition of E. coli could be ascribed to the physical presence of Lactococcus cells rather than their metabolites excreted into the medium. Failure to observe any inhibition in fermented broths at their natural pH (4.0) was ascribed to the poor chelating power of EDTA under acid conditions.
TI  - Formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  - Mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. Mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. The morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. Different bacterial strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. The results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by a surface film. The basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane. The membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. The results of this investigation seem to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. This type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Byrsonima crassifolia (L.) H.B.K.
AB  - From Byrsonima crassifolia (L.) H.B.K. a tropical tree widely distributed in Mexico, Central and South America, which has been used medicinally since prehispanic times, we report here the antibacterial activities of organic extracts of roots and stems. The ethyl acetate of roots was the most active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epididermis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - [Bactericidal properties of copper (II) complexes with 1-alkylimidazole].
AB  - The copper(II) complexes with 1-alkylimidazole were prepared. Bactericidal properties of the obtained complexes against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. Particularly high activity against microbial strains was shown by complex [Cu(1-C4H9Im)4(CIO4)2].
TI  - Synergistic antimicrobial effect of nisin whey permeate and lactic acid on microbes isolated from fish.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of a combination of lactic acid and whey permeate fermented by a nisin-producing Lactococcus lactis strain was tested by the agar diffusion method using bacteria isolated from fish as test organisms. Lactic acid inhibited all bacterial strains studied, but nisin whey permeate inhibited Gram-positive bacteria only. The combination was more effective than lactic acid alone against Pseudomonas fluorescens and Staphylococcus hominis isolated from fish, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9721 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC9341.
TI  - Performance evaluation of disinfectant formulations using poloxamer-hydrogel biofilm-constructs.
AB  - Poloxamer F127 is a di-block co-polymer of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene.  Aqueous solutions show thermo-reversible gelation, being liquid at temperatures < 15 degrees C and robust gels at temperatures > 15 degrees C. Chilled poloxamer solutions (30% w/v) were inoculated with approximately 10(4-5) cfu ml-1 of stationary phase cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ps. fluorescens, Pantoea agglomerans, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis or Listeria innocua. Drops (200 microliters) of the inoculated poloxamers were placed on stainless steel coupons held in Petri dishes containing moistened cotton wool and incubated at 30 degrees C for 5 h. All strains grew well giving between 10(6-7) cfu ml-1 at 5-6 h. The cultured gels were readily applied to tests of biocide effectiveness as the stainless steel coupons could be removed and flooded with biocide solution for fixed exposure times. Provided that the temperature of the biocide solutions was > 15 degrees C, the integrity of the gels could be maintained during exposure. After exposure, the gels and their supports were removed to separate tubes containing neutralizer solution (< 15 degrees C). The gels rapidly dispersed within 5 min to ensure a complete recovery of the sample population. Biofilm-constructs and cell suspensions (10(7) cfu ml-1) were exposed to four commercial disinfectant formulations, based on hypochlorite, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and a tenside, at recommended use levels. Cell suspensions, in the presence of bovine serum albumen (BSA; 0.03% w/v), were subject to a > 5-log kill within 5 min while the killing effected against the biofilm-constructs varied between 0.4 and 2-log reductions. The results indicate a high degree of reproducibility between replicate samples, with patterns of susceptibility varying both as a function of organism, biocide type and concentration. The experiments strongly support the view that poloxamer-constructs are suitable for application in trials and testing of disinfectant formulations.
TI  - In vitro determination of direct antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine in vitro the time required for calcium hydroxide in direct contact with microorganisms to express its antimicrobial effect. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC-9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-6538), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC-25586), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-27853), Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus sp. The strains were cultivated in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI), with the exception of F. nucleatum (BHI-PRAS). Pure and mixed suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared. Paper cones immersed in these substances were covered with calcium hydroxide paste, and after 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days they were transferred to an appropriate medium to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. Incubation was conducted at 37 degrees C for 48 h, according to the requirements of oxygen of each microorganism. The antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide was shown to occur after 12 h on M. luteus and F. nucleatum, 24 h on Streptococcus sp, 48 h on E. coli, and 72 h on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Mixture II (M. luteus + Streptococcus sp + S. aureus) was sensitive to calcium hydroxide antimicrobial potential after 48 h, whereas mixture I (M. luteus + E. coli + P. aeruginosa), mixture III (E. coli + P. aeruginosa), and mixture IV (S. aureus + P. aeruginosa) were inactivated after 72 h of exposure.
TI  - Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to a photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - The photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD-Arg(2)) on the growth of selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates is described as compared to the effect of hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD). Growth inhibition of HpD-Arg(2) of three Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and five laboratory strains of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) was observed as well. Serratia marcescens strain was resistant to light-activated HpD-Arg(2) or HpD. The antimicrobial activity of light-activated HpD-Arg(2) against P. aeruginosa may offer an additional option in the anti-pseudomonal therapy of wounds.
TI  - Detection of extracellular proteases from microorganisms on agar plates.
AB  - We present herein an improved assay for detecting the presence of extracellular proteases from microorganisms on agar plates. Using different substrates (gelatin, BSA, hemoglobin) incorporated into the agar and varying the culture medium composition, we were able to detect proteolytic activities from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus luteus and Serratia marcescens as well as the influence that these components displayed in the expression of these enzymes. For all microorganisms tested we found that in agar-BHI or yeast extract medium containing gelatin the sensitivity of proteinase detection was considerably greater than in BSA-agar or hemoglobin-agar. However, when BSA or hemoglobin were added to the culture medium, there was an increase in growth along with a marked reduction in the amount of proteinase production. In the case of M. luteus the incorporation of glycerol in BHI or yeast extract gelatin-agar induced protease liberation. Our results indicate that the technique described here is of value for detecting extracellular proteases directly in the culture medium, by means of a qualitative assay, simple, inexpensive, straight forward method to assess the presence of the proteolytic activity of a given microorganism colony with great freedom in substrate selection.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of spermidine-based mixed catechol- and hydroxamate-containing siderophore--vancomycin conjugates.
AB  - The first antibiotic conjugates of vancomycin (1) and siderophore analogues containing spermidine-based catechol ligands (conjugate 11) as well as mixed catechol and hydroxamate ligands (conjugate 13) are described. The design of the conjugates was based on the earlier observation that conjugation of siderophore components to beta-lactam antibiotics induced active iron transport-mediated drug delivery. The novel conjugates (11 and 13) were synthesized by selective acylation of the primary amino group of 1. Preliminary biological studies indicated that siderophore modified vancomycins lost some activity (4- to 16-fold) against Gram-positive bacteria relative to vancomycin itself, and were generally similar to vancomycin in activity against Gram-negative bacteria under iron-sufficient conditions. However, under iron-depleted conditions which mimic human serum, conjugate 11 displayed enhanced antibacterial activity against an antibiotic hypersensitive strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  - Many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. It has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary pH, with consequent stone formation. Unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g. Escherichia coli). It has been recently reported that E. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. This study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Micrococcus luteus. Subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (P < 0.003) reduce the UK activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. The urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, M. luteus, was, however, the exception (P = 0.1079). In contrast to S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and M. luteus (P < 0.0213), P. mirabilis and S. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase activity (P < 0.4047). These results may explain why Proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. According to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. These conditions may lead to renal stone formation. An increase in urinary pH resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. It is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double role in renal stone formation.
TI  - A rapid staining procedure to demonstrate glycocalyx production and bacterial biofilms.
AB  - A novel staining procedure to demonstrate glycocalyx production by clinical isolates is presented. The short times required, specificity and sensitivity suggest that the staining could be applied to routine in vitro diagnostic procedures.
TI  - [Bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. II. Relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
AB  - The bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. In first examinations (I. communication) (19) the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. In this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. Materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. The bactericide effect on Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. This results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.
TI  - [Bacterial reducing qualities of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. I. Contamination and sedimentation in humid and dry conditions].
AB  - In this examination the bactericide qualities of different materials were tested. Particularly the effect of humidity was examined. 3 materials containing copper ("copper", "brass" and "brass sheet") and 2 materials not containing copper ("polyamide B" and "high-grade steel") were tested. The surfaces of the 5 types of material were contaminated with a suspension of 2 different bacteria species (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus). After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined by the standardized method of the "Guidelines of the German Society of Hygiene and Microbiology". Additionally the sedimentation of airborne microorganisms on the materials was tested by determining the number of colony-forming-units after defined exposure times. In further examinations the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined. The results show, a bactericide quality of copper depends on the percent of copper-content of the tested materials, exposure time, humidity, frequency of contamination and bacteria species. Humidity and only single contamination cause a reduction of bacteria. Reduction of gram-negative bacteria is more easily than reduction of gram-positive bacteria. Enterococcus faecium shows the highest, Pseudomonas aeruginosa the lowest reduction rate of bacteria in the following sequence: Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity in vitro of chlorhexidine, a mixture of isothiazolinones ('Kathon' CG) and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB).
AB  - Chlorehexidine, two 4% chlorhexidine antiseptic handwashes ('Bioprep' and 'Hibiclens'), cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and isothiazolinones ('Kathon') were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Candida albicans. The activities measured were the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC), rate of kill in water and broth, effect of organic soil, the development of microbial resistance on continuous exposure and agent bioavailability in media and formulation. 'Kathon' was the most active microbistatic agent showing maximal activity at low concentration, least inactivation by organic soil and media components and the lowest level of development of bacterial resistance. It was synergistic with chlorhexidine against S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Media, formulation components and organic soil affected the performance of chlorhexidine and CTAB. Chlorhexidine was more broadly active than CTAB but showed a greater reduction in activity in the presence of soil and engendered a greater level of bacterial resistance. It was more rapidly bactericidal to P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens than to S. aureus. Stable resistance to chlorhexidine and CTAB was developed by P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens, the latter showing the higher level of resistance. Chlorhexidine-resistant strains were also resistant to CTAB. The antiseptic formulations were more rapidly bactericidal than chlorhexidine alone but were otherwise of comparable activity. Mixtures of disinfectants, in particular a combination of chlorhexidine and a preservative level of 'Kathon', were more active than single disinfectants. The importance of standardization of media and test conditions and the use of chemically defined media for accurate and reproducible in-vitro testing of disinfectant activity is emphasized. Disinfection kinetics, expressed as time-kill curves, log reduction factors or decimal reduction times were shown to be valuable in differentiating microbistatic from microbicidal activity, showing the effects of dilution and soil on activity and indicating possible different mechanisms of action.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity determined in strains of Bacillus circulans cluster.
AB  - Wild-type strains of the genus Bacillus were screened for antimicrobial activity. Two strains exhibited antimicrobial activity against Micrococcus luteus and were identified as Bacillus polymyxa MIR-23 and Bacillus circulans MIR-13. Bacillus polymyxa MIR-23 was active against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus niger, whereas Bacillus circulans MIR-13 did not show activity against these microorganisms. Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and B. polymyxa ATCC 10401 were used as standard antibiotic-producer strain and showed different antimicrobial profiles and yields from B. polymyxa MIR-23. The different antimicrobial profile of the two selected strains could possibly be used as a taxonomic marker.
TI  - [The determination of the discrepancy between the mathematically ascertained and  experimentally provable efficiency of UV facilities for water disinfection].
AB  - Using three UV-plants of different technical designs for water disinfection, we studied the conformity between experimental germ reduction using standard test organisms and calculated UV-doses under various water flow conditions. Taking into consideration the style of construction of the UV-plants, the irradiation area and the layer thickness were used as constant parameters for dose calculations. This was also employed for the irradiation intensity, since the experiments were performed for a relatively short period compared of the life span of the UV-irradiators. Both exposure time and water transmission were employed as variable parameters in the dose calculations and experimental procedures respectively. The calculated UV-dose and experimentally obtained germ reduction values were comparatively the same for two of the three UV-plants studied. However, no correlation was observed between the reduction of E. coli and the corresponding calculated UV-dose values. Therefore, the calculated UV-dose values for any given UV-plant should be considered to be relative and by no means absolute values. We are of the opinion that within a certain range of water flow rate and transmission, antimicrobial effectiveness of different UV-plants should be demonstrated independent of dose values, technical and other construction characteristics. The applicability of the UV-plants studied is discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. Of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; D-sphingosine; D,L-sphinganine; 4-D-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; N,N-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against Staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microM]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microM]). The sphingosines were similarly active against Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, Brevibacterium epidermidis, and Candida albicans, moderately active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. Both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. Optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees C and at pH 6.5. Antimicrobial activity, which was Ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. Because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
TI  - Distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  - Mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in January, April, July, and October from 1984 to 1989. Unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the Jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. Of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. From the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forPseudomonas syringae, followed byXanthomonas campestris (6.7%),Erwinia herbicola (6%),Acetobacter aceti (4.7%),Gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),Pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),Bacillus megaterium (3.8%),Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),Lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),Curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),Micrococcus luteus (2.2%),Arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),Klebsiella planticola (1.2%),Streptococcus faecium (1.2%),Clavibacter sp. (0.98%),Micrococcus sp. (0.82%),Serratia marcescens (0.81%),Bacillus subtilis (0.57%),Cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),Erwinia sp. (0.37%),Zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),Bacillus sp. (0.29%),Alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),Erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andPseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). Bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. Communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. The communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.
TI  - Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  - Pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees C to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. Pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. Harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. Pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except Bacillus cereus spores. Gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than Gram-positive ones. Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. Only less than one-log cfu/g of B. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that E. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic RNA at lower pressure than S. aureus. From the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.
TI  - Analysis of cell division gene ftsZ (sulB) from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The ftsZ (sulB) gene of Escherichia coli codes for a 40,000-dalton protein that carries out a key step in the cell division pathway. The presence of an ftsZ gene protein in other bacterial species was examined by a combination of Southern blot and Western blot analyses. Southern blot analysis of genomic restriction digests revealed that many bacteria, including species from six members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, contained sequences which hybridized with an E. coli ftsZ probe. Genomic DNA from more distantly related bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus, did not hybridize under minimally stringent conditions. Western blot analysis, with anti-E. coli FtsZ antiserum, revealed that all bacterial species examined contained a major immunoreactive band. Several of the Enterobacteriaceae were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding the E. coli ftsZ gene. These transformed strains, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, were shown to overproduce the FtsZ protein and to produce minicells. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled minicells revealed that the plasmid-encoded gene products were the major labeled species. This demonstrated that the E. coli ftsZ gene could function in other bacterial species to induce minicells and that these minicells could be used to analyze plasmid-endoced gene products.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetics of cefoperazone concentration in human lung tissue].
AB  - In 11 patients, the concentration of cefoperazone (CPZ) in the lung tissue were studied after a 2 g intravenous bolus injection. Samples of lung tissue and blood were taken during surgery at 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after administration of CPZ. All samples were assayed by the paper disc method using Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 as the indicator strain. All assay results of lung tissue were corrected for the amount of blood contained in the tissue samples by the hemoglobin content in the homogenate of lung tissue. The CPZ levels in the lung tissue were 116.2 micrograms/g at 15 min., 94.1 micrograms/g at 30 min., 74.6 micrograms/g at 60 min., 67.9 micrograms/g at 120 min., 54.6 micrograms/g at 180 min., 29.2 micrograms/g at 240 min. and 22.7 micrograms/g at 300 min. after administration, respectively. These values were higher than MIC90 values of CPZ for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae. The level of CPZ in the lung tissue was higher than 50% of the level in the serum until 180 minutes after administration of CPZ.
TI  - [Antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment].
AB  - This study was carried out to understand the antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment in boiling water. The samples included the core and the outer layers of onion, the white and the green parts of green onion, garlic bulb, ginger, ginger root, sweet pepper, chili pepper, brown pepper, and mustard. The test microorganisms included Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium phlei, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Micrococcus luteus. Raw garlic bulb could inhibit all of the test strains. The antibacterial activities of green onion are slightly weak than that of onion. However, green onion could inhibit P. aeruginosa and M. luteus, but onion could inhibit E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. faecalis, and B. cereus. Ginger and ginger root could only inhibit M. luteus. Chili pepper could inhibit V. parahaemolyticus and P. vulgaris. Brown pepper could also inhibit P. vulgaris. Sweet pepper and mustard showed no antibacterial activity to all of the test strains. In general, antibacterial components in the spice plants were heat labile. All the spices tested lost their antibacterial activities within 20 min at 100 degrees C.
TI  - N-terminal analogues of cecropin A: synthesis, antibacterial activity, and conformational properties.
AB  - Six analogues of the 37-residue antibacterial peptide cecropin A were synthesized by the solid-phase method: cecropin A-(2-37), [Glu2]cecropin A, [Pro4]cecropin A, [Glu6]cecropin A, [Leu6]cecropin A, and [Pro8]cecropin A. Their antibacterial activities against four test organisms were determined and related to conformational changes observed in their CD spectra and were discussed on the basis of a previously proposed amphipathic alpha-helix model. An aromatic residue in position 2 was shown to be important for activity against all tested bacteria. The highly alpha-helical 1-11 region of cecropin A did not appear to play a significant role in its activity against Escherichia coli but was clearly involved in its interaction against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus megaterium, and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of sugar osazones and anhydro sugars.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of 14 sugar osazones and anhydro sugars was studied with model strains of Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus licheniformis, Escherichia coli and strains Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from clinical material. The relationship between the structure of these compounds, their solubility in water and 1-octanol and antimicrobial effect was investigated.
TI  - Ensifer adhaerens Predatory Activity Against Other Bacteria in Soil, as Monitored by Indirect Phage Analysis.
AB  - An indirect phage analysis procedure was used to detect and follow the activity of the bacterial predator Ensifer adhaerens in situ in natural soil. The soil was percolated with an aqueous suspension of washed bacterial host cells so that the E. adhaerens cells naturally present in the soil would multiply in response to the host cells. The natural phage development which ensued against these multiplying E. adhaerens cells in the soil was then monitored by noting plaques which developed when the percolation fluid was plated with laboratory strains of E. adhaerens on laboratory media. The activities of the other members of the predation system that includes E. adhaerens (Streptomyces sp. strain 34 and a myxobacter) could not be monitored directly by phage analysis because phage were not found for them. Indirect monitoring was possible, however, because they were susceptible to attack by E. adhaerens. In general, the results were in agreement with previous observations by other methods of the predation sequence. E. adhaerens attacked Micrococcus luteus, Streptomyces sp. strain 34, and the myxobacter but did not attack several other possible species of hosts. It also did not respond to percolation of the soil with various nutrient solutions. E. adhaerens phage activity was not present in half of the soils percolated with M. luteus cells. This seemed to reflect too great a phage-host specificity for the technique as regards these soils, because E. adhaerens-like bacteria other than the strains used for plaquing were present in at least some of these soils. Although E. adhaerens did not attack Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa in soil, there was an overproduction of E. adhaerens phage if these bacteria were percolated simultaneously with M. luteus cells. The possibility is discussed that this represents an activation by M. luteus (or by a heat-extractable factor from it) of other bacterial predators that attack E. coli or P. aeruginosa and that these predators subsequently are themselves attacked by E. adhaerens.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristic of insoluble alkylpyridinium iodide.
AB  - Insoluble and soluble alkylpyridinium iodides (C8 to C18) were synthesized. The insoluble agents were quaternized 4-vinylpyridine-divinylbenzene copolymers. The insoluble agent [C12(50)] that contained 50% divinylbenzene and had a C12 alkyl chain was selected as the most suitable insoluble agent. C12(50) showed poor durability of the antibacterial activity, but C12(50), which had lost the activity, was refreshed by washing with ethanol. This washing became ineffective after a few cycles of antibacterial treatment and refreshment. Such C12(50) recovered the activity upon 1.0 N NaOH treatment. The antibacterial activity of C12(50) depended on its surface area. It showed high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and also showed activity against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. But the activities of C12(50) and laurylpyridinium iodide solution were different against some microbes. The antibacterial activities of the agents were investigated against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus under various conditions. The activity of C12(50) was higher at a higher temperature or at a lower cell concentration. The activity of C12(50) decreased on addition of NaCl, glucose, or bovine albumin to the cell suspension or in 0.01 M sodium-potassium phosphate buffer. C12(50) showed less activity when cells were mixed with dead cells or the supernatant of dead cells killed in an autoclave. The mode of action of the laurylpyridinium iodide solution against E. coli and M. luteus was similar to that of C12(50) except for the influence of E. coli cell concentration.
TI  - Distribution of membrane-bound monoamine oxidase in bacteria.
AB  - The distribution of membrane-bound monoamine oxidase in 30 strains of various bacteria was studied. Monoamine oxidase was determined by using an ammonia-selective electrode; analyses were sensitive and easy to perform. The enzyme was found in some strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae, such as Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Salmonella, Serratia, and Proteus. Among strains of other families of bacteria tested, only Pseudomonas aeruginosa IFO 3901, Micrococcus luteus IFO 12708, and Brevibacterium ammoniagenes IAM 1641 had monoamine oxidase activity. In all of these bacteria except B. ammoniagenes, monoamine oxidase was induced by tyramine and was highly specific for tyramine, octopamine, dopamine, and norepinephrine. The enzyme in two strains oxidized histamine or benzylamine. Correlations between the distributions of membrane-bound monoamine oxidase and arylsulfatase synthesized in the presence of tyramine were discussed.
