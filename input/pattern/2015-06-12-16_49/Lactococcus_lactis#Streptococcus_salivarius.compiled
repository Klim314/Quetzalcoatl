TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly Irish subjects.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms Lactobacillus bulgaricus LMG 6901 and Listeria innocua DPC 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. Genomic fingerprinting following ApaI digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. The antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. The predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Enterococcus spp. A number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including ABP-118 and salivaricin B (from Lact. salivarius), enterocin B (Enterococcus faecium), lactacin B (Lact. acidophilus), gassericin T and a variant of gassericin A (Lact. gasseri), were identified. Interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: Lactococcus lactis producing nisin Z and Streptococcus mutans producing mutacin II. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
TI  - Identification of the bacterial community responsible for traditional fermentation during sour cassava starch, cachaca and minas cheese production using culture-independent 16s rRNA gene sequence analysis.
AB  - We used a cultivation-independent, clone library-based 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis to identify bacterial communities present during traditional fermentation in sour cassava starch, cachaca and cheese production in Brazil. Partial 16S rRNA gene clone sequences from sour cassava starch samples collected on day five of the fermentation process indicated that Leuconostoc citreum was the most prevalent species, representing 47.6% of the clones. After 27 days of fermentation, clones (GenBank accession numbers GQ999786 and GQ999788) related to unculturable bacteria were the most prevalent, representing 43.8% of the clones from the bacterial community analyzed. The clone represented by the sequence GQ999786 was the most prevalent at the end of the fermentation period. The majority of clones obtained from cachaca samples during the fermentation of sugar cane juice were from the genus Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus nagelli was the most prevalent at the beginning of the fermentation process, representing 76.9% of the clones analyzed. After 21 days, Lactobacillus harbinensis was the most prevalent species, representing 75% of the total clones. At the end of the fermentation period, Lactobacillus buchneri was the most prevalent species, representing 57.9% of the total clones. In the Minas cheese samples, Lactococcus lactis was the most prevalent species after seven days of ripening. After 60 days of ripening, Streptococcus salivarius was the most prevalent species. Our data show that these three fermentation processes are conducted by a succession of bacterial species, of which lactic acid bacteria are the most prevalent.
TI  - Detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci by rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-PCR.
AB  - An analytical system based on rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for enumeration of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci was established. Subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16S or 23S rRNA from Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Lactococcus were newly developed. The RT-qPCR method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the Enterococcus genus, the Streptococcus genus, and several Streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qPCR method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces). The RT-qPCR analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the genus-specific primer sets revealed that Enterococcus and Streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and 7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]), respectively. Detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique Enterococcus species, including the E. avium subgroup, the E. faecium subgroup, E. faecalis, the E. casseliflavus subgroup, and E. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal Streptococcus species was found to be S. salivarius. Various Lactococcus species, such as L. lactis subsp. lactis or L. lactis subsp. cremoris, L. garvieae, L. piscium, and L. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram feces) and prevalence (33%). These results suggest that the RT-qPCR method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of Ugandan ghee.
AB  - Ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western Uganda. However, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. The aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. The most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. L. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. Two of the four most commonly isolated LAB species (L. helveticus and L. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (PCR-DGGE). Other main LAB species identified in mashita by PCR-DGGE were Bifidobacterium sp., Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus sp., Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Streptococcus salivarius. The main species of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) identified in the mashita using PCR-DGGE method were Acetobacter aceti, Acetobacter lovaniensis, Acetobacter orientalis and Acetobacter pasteurianus. PCR-DGGE identification of yeasts showed that Brettanomyces custersianus, Candida silvae, Geotrichum sp., Issatchenkia occidentalis, Issatchenkia orientalis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. A. lovaniensis, A. aceti, and I. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using PCR-DGGE method. Other microbial species were only found in some samples. These results indicate that LAB and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also AAB are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.
TI  - Short-term relative antibacterial effect of octenidine dihydrochloride on the oral microflora in orthodontically treated patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of common antiseptic mouth rinses and octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT). METHODS: The antibacterial activities of antiseptics against total and cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species) in saliva were studied in vitro and in vivo. After unstimulated saliva was collected, one of the mouth rinse solutions was applied for 30seconds. Saliva samples were collected 15, 30, 60, and 120min later and evaluated for their bacterial count. RESULTS: OCT had a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the studied bacteria than 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and 7.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complex (PVP-I) from 15min to 120min following the application (p<0.01). The antiseptic efficacy of 0.2% CHX on total bacteria and Lactobacillus species was very similar to the efficacy observed with 7.5% PVP-I mouth solution from 15min up to 120min. Streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by 0.15mg/ml PVP-I, 0.5mg/ml CHX, and 0.1mg/ml OCT concentrations, while Streptococcus salivarius was inhibited by 0.15mg/ml PVP-I, 2mg/ml CHX, and 0.8mg/ml OCT concentrations. Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis was inhibited with 0.00313mg/ml OCT, 30mg/ml PVP-I, and 0.0063mg/ml CHX concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: OCT compared favorably with CHX and PVP-I in its antibacterial effects, both in vitro and in vivo (p<0.01).
TI  - Diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  - Exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy Streptococcus species S. thermophilus, S. macedonicus and S. salivarius, were exposed to acid, osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. Three strains of dairy related streptococci, Lactococcus lactis ATCC11454, Enterococcus faecium DSM20477 and Enterococcus faecalis DSM20478, were included for comparison purposes. Acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. Cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrilamide Gel Electrophoresis, respectively. All strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. With a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. For some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses. Matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. Significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. Adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. Adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (DnaK, GprE, GroEL, and GroES) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between stress response and band intensity was evident.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the one humped camel milk  produced in Morocco.
AB  - One hundred and twenty (120) strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were enumerated and isolated from raw dromedary milk in Morocco using various cultured media. Strains isolated were characterized by phenotypic, physiological and biochemical properties. Results showed that high counts of LAB were found. Presumptive lactobacilli counts ranged from 2.5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive lactococci levels varied from 5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive streptococci counts varied from 4.2x10(2) to 8x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive leuconostoc levels ranged from 5.4x10(2) to 5.4x10(7)cfu/ml. Results showed also that Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were the predominant genera with 37.5% and 25.8%, respectively. The dominated species found were Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (17.5%), Lactobacillus helveticus (10%), Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (9.20%), Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (5.80%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (5%). This is the first report on the characterization of LAB strains isolated from the one humped camel milk produced in Morocco.
TI  - A lacticin 3147 enriched food ingredient reduces Streptococcus mutans isolated from the human oral cavity in saliva.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterise Streptococcus mutans from Irish saliva samples  and to assess their sensitivity to a food-grade preparation of the lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by Lactococcus lactis DPC3147. METHODS AND RESULTS: Saliva samples collected from children with varying oral health status were screened on Mitis Salivarius agar for the presence of pathogenic streptococci. Following selective plating, 16S rDNA sequencing and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), 15 distinct strains of Strep. mutans were identified. These were grouped according to their relative sensitivity to lacticin 3147 which ranged from 0.78 to 6.25%; relative to a sensitive indicator strain, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis HP. Inhibition of indicator Strep. mutans strains from sensitive, intermediate and tolerant groupings were assessed in microtitre plate assays with increasing concentrations of lacticin 3147. The concentration of lacticin 3147 required to give 50% growth inhibition correlated with their relative sensitivities (as assayed by well diffusion methodology) and ranged from 1280 to 5120 AU ml(-1). Concentrated preparations of lacticin 3147 caused a rapid killing of Strep. mutans strains in broth. Moreover, in human saliva deliberately spiked with Strep. mutans, the pathogen was eliminated (initial inoculum of 10(5)) in the presence of 40,000 AU ml(-1) of lacticin 3147. Furthermore, a food-grade lacticin 3147 spray dried powder ingredient was assessed for the inhibition of Strep. mutans in human saliva, spiked with a strain of intermediate sensitivity, resulting in up to a 4-log reduction in counts after 20 min. CONCLUSION: A food grade preparation of lacticin 3147 was effective in the inhibition of oral Strep. mutans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The inhibition of oral streptococci by food grade preparations of lacticin 3147 may offer novel opportunities for the development of lacticin 3147 as an anti-cariogenic agent particularly in the area of functional foods for the improvement of oral health.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Biosurfactant from Lactococcus lactis 53 inhibits microbial adhesion on silicone  rubber.
AB  - The ability of biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium Lactococcus lactis 53 to inhibit adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements. Water contact angles indicated that the silicone-rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (48 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). The results showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates of Staphylococcus epidermidis GB 9/6 from 2,100 to 220 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 from 1560 to 137 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), and Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 from 1255 to 135 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), allowing for a 90% reduction of the deposition rates. The deposition rates of Rothia dentocariosa GBJ 52/2B, Candida albicans GBJ 13/4A, and Candida tropicalis GB 9/9 were far less reduced in the presence of the biosurfactant as compared with the other strains. This study constitutes a step ahead in developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of silicone-rubber voice prostheses.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from AOC Salers cheese.
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk Salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. The characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: Rep-PCR, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA for strain typing and taxonomic identification. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garviae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus millieri, Streptococcus macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. The natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined to identify and characterize natural microflora. This study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the Facultatively Heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and SB medium selective for Enterococcus. The study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of Salers cheese and its diversity. A better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.
TI  - Changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  - Whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. During this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. This study surveyed industry samples of Cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees C) and abuse (37.8 degrees C) temperatures. Samples stored at 4 degrees C did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. Mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees C. Whey samples derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. Starter cultures evaluated included Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. Whey derived from L. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees C as compared with the other cultures. Galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from L. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees C in comparison with the other cultures. Results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees C) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees C varies depending on the culture(s) used in cheese production.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the Streptococcus salivarius methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP).
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) was purified from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain containing the S. salivarius map gene, which codes for MetAP. S. salivarius map coded for a protein of 286 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 31,723 Da and a pI of 4.6. The native enzyme eluted from a Superdex column as a protein with a molecular mass of 30.6 kDa and cleaved N-terminal Met of peptide only when the penultimate amino acid was Gly, Ala, Ser, Val, Pro, or Thr. The enzyme was more active against tetrapeptides than tripeptides and did not recognize dipeptides. It required the presence of a metal cation for activity, with a preference for Co(2+) over Mn(2+). S. salivarius MetAP has a pH optimum of 8.0 and an optimal temperature at 50 degrees C. The S. salivarius protein had an extra sequence of 24 amino acids between two conserved aspartate residues involved in the coordination of the metal ion. A similar extra sequence is present in MetAP from other streptococci and from Lactococcus lactis, but not from other bacteria or eukaryotes.
TI  - Multiple competitive PCR-DGGE as a tool for quantifying and profiling defined mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria during production of probiotics from complex polysaccharides.
AB  - AIMS: To apply a denaturing gradient gel electrophoretic (DGGE) method to quantify and profile individual strains during a mixed culture fermentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA was extracted during the culture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and amplified in a multiple competitive PCR (cPCR) using general primers targeting 16S rDNA and DNA from Streptococcus salivarius as competitive DNA. Subsequently the 200-kb amplified fragments were separated by DGGE. The method was validated in pure cultures and used to profile a mixture of three LAB grown on glucose, soluble starch and glycogen from mussel processing waste. The inclusion of a starch- and glycogen-degrading strain (Lactobacillus plantarum) and a weakly amylotic nisin-resistant strain (Lact. paracasei) allowed proliferation of the nisin producing Lactococcus lactis which in itself is unable to grow on complex carbohydrates. cPCR-DGGE permitted the monitoring of a different strain succession on the different carbohydrates, related to amylolytic activity and substrate consumption, acid production and nisin production. CONCLUSIONS: cPCR-DGGE is a useful tool for profiling defined mixed cultures of bacteria and hence allows their interaction to be studied. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Provided validation of the method for each specific case, it may be appropriate to monitor and control the reproducibility of any defined mixed culture of bacteria, with the advantage that an increase in the strain numbers to be monitored does not yield an increase in the labour of the procedure.
TI  - The effect of temperature and pH on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a pH-auxostat study.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a pH-auxostat. The computer-controlled smooth change of pH or temperature was used to study the effect of pH and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield Y(ATP) and specific lactate production rate Q(ATP)). The behaviour of mu and Q(ATP) with an increase of temperature suggested that ATP production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The decrease of Y(ATP) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while Q(ATP) remained constant or even increased. With the decrease of pH, decrease of both Y(ATP) and Q(ATP) was observed. S. thermophilus St20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees C was the most acid sensitive strain. The L. paracasei E1H3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to pH change. The behaviour of mixed culture of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus in milk in a pH-auxostat with pH-decrease was in agreement with the pure culture experiments of the same species. The study showed that pH-auxostat with smooth controlled change of pH and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of LAB.
TI  - Influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  - Intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. The stimulus of the mucosal immunity is not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. In previous works we have demonstrated that some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. Taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis on the IgA secreting cells associated to bronchus. As shown before, oral immunostimulation with LAB induced an increase of the IgA* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. In this study it is also showed that the LAB assayed, with exception of L. acidophilus, were able to enhance IgA+ cells at bronchial level, being also this effect dose dependent. The increment induced by some LAB in the number of IgA+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be very important to prevent bronchus diseases.
TI  - [Viability and activity of the lactic bacteria (Streptococcus salivarius ssp thermophilus y Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus) del yogurt en Venezuela].
AB  - National and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. In Venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. This research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. For this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. The different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. These samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of pH and acidity. The absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. The succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. The data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pMV158 family.
AB  - Twenty-two Streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. Fifteen S. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using DNA homology. Ten plasmids were classified within group A and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced S. thermophilus plasmids. Three plasmids (group B) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups C and D). Single-stranded DNA was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups A, C, and D, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. The only plasmid of group C, named pSMQ172, was further characterized. This 4230-bp plasmid replicates in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. Comparisons with databases showed that pSMQ172 was related to pMV158 of Streptococcus agalactiae and to pSSU1 of Streptococcus suis. These results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. Antigens administered orally can interact with M cells of Peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. The aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. We studied IgA+ and IgM+ B cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and CD4+ T cells and IgA anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. The increase in the IgA+ B cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the IgA cycle by interaction with M cells from Peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. The IgM+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from IgM+ to IgA+. The increase in the CD4+ cells suggests interaction of Peyer's patches and enhancement of the B- and T-cell migration. The anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. We demonstrated that Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were able to interact with Peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in IgA-, CD4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. Although Lb. rhamnosus and Strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. Lactococcus lactis and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of IgA+ cells entering the IgA cycle but not CD4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated B lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. We did not determine specific antibodies against Lc. lactis or Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Cell wall anchoring of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The M6 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. Based on the observation that the C-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several Lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing Lactobacillus fermentum strain, Lactobacillus sake, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. The M6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. In lactobacilli, essentially all detectable M6 protein was cell wall associated. These results suggest the feasibility of using the C-terminal anchor moiety of M6 for protein surface display in LAB.
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - 16S-23S and 23S-5S intergenic spacer regions of Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius, primary and secondary structure.
AB  - The 16S-23S intergenic spacer region (spacer region 1) of Streptococcus salivarius, S. thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and the 23S-5S intergenic spacer region (spacer region 2) of S. salivarius and L. lactis subsp. cremoris were sequenced and compared with the spacer regions 1 and 2 of other streptococci. A high degree of intraspecific conservation was observed for S. thermophilus and L. lactis, and very similar sequences were found for S. salivarius and S. thermophilus. Whereas spacer region 1 is highly conserved in the genus Streptococcus sensu-stricto, only the tRNA gene and the rRNA processing stems are highly conserved in the three genera: Streptococcus sensu-stricto, Lactococcus, and Enterococcus. The presence of a unique tRNA(Ala) gene without the 3' terminal CCA sequence seems to be a general feature of the streptococci spacer region 1. A secondary structure model was built to show the interaction between the spacer regions 1 and 2 of S. thermophilus and S. salivarius. The rapid evolution of spacer region 1 in streptococci is in part due to insertions and deletions of small RNA stem/loop structures.
TI  - Distribution of proteins similar to IIIManH and IIIManL of the Streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  - In Streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins EI and HPr, the specific membrane-bound IIIMan, and two forms of a protein called IIIMan, with molecular weights of 38,900 (IIIManH) and 35,200 (IIIManL), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the membrane. Several lines of evidence suggest that IIIManH and/or IIIManL are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. To determine whether other bacteria possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Three approaches were used to determine whether the IIIMan proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-IIIManH and anti-IIIManH rabbit polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of PEP-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-IIIMan antibodies of the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. Only the species S. salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of IIIMan. Fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. In the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of PEP. No such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. A III(Man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in Lactobacillus casei by Western blot experiments as well as by PEP-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-III(Man) antibodies was detected in Lactococcus lactis. In several cases, the involvement of these putative III(Man) proteins in the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-III(Man) antibodies. No proteins cross-reacting with anti-III(Man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and E. coli. In S. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. This protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of PEP.
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a general aminopeptidase (St-PepN) from Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CNRZ 302.
AB  - A general aminopeptidase (St-PepN) was purified from an intracellular extract of  Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CNRZ 302 by ion-exchange chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme in denaturing or nondenaturating conditions showed a single protein band. The enzyme is a monomer with a molecular mass of 97 kDa. Its activity is maximal at pH 7 and 36 degrees C and is completely abolished by CuCl2 and ZnCl2. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by metal-chelating reagents, such as EDTA and o-phenanthroline, which suggests that St-PepN is a metalloenzyme. The enzyme showed activity toward p-nitroanilide derivatives or dipeptides and tripeptides and showed a preference for hydrophobic or basic amino acids at the N-terminal position. Longer peptide chains, such as the B-chain of insulin, glucagon, or peptides generated by the hydrolysis of caseins, were degraded, too. The sequence of the first 21 residues of the mature enzyme was determined and showed high homology with that of the aminopeptidase PepN isolated from Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2. The properties of the enzyme are compared with those of corresponding enzymes of other species of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Aminopeptidase N from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus NCDO 573: purification and properties.
AB  - A 96 kDa aminopeptidase was purified from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus NCDO 573. The enzyme had similar properties to aminopeptidases isolated from lactococci and lactobacilli and showed a high degree of N-terminal amino acid sequence homology to aminopeptidase N from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. It catalysed the hydrolysis of a range of aminoacyl 4-nitroanilides and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin derivatives, dipeptides, tripeptides and oligopeptides. In common with aminopeptidases from other lactic acid bacteria, the enzyme from Strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus showed highest activity with lysyl derivatives but was also very active with arginyl and leucyl derivatives. Relative activity with alanyl, phenylalanyl, tyrosyl, seryl and valyl derivatives was considerably lower and with glycyl, glutamyl and prolyl derivatives almost negligible. The aminopeptidase also catalysed the hydrolysis of dipeptides and tripeptides but mostly at rates much less than that with L-lysyl-4-nitroanilide and oligopeptides. The enzyme catalysed the successive hydrolysis of various amino acid residues from the N-terminus of several oligopeptides but it was unable to cleave peptide bonds on the N-terminal side of a proline residue.
TI  - Direct screening of recombinants in gram-positive bacteria using the secreted staphylococcal nuclease as a reporter.
AB  - A system for direct screening of recombinant clones in Lactococcus lactis, based  on secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) in the organism, was developed. The nuc gene (encoding SNase) was cloned on both rolling-circle and theta-replicating plasmids. L. lactis strains containing these nuc+ plasmids secrete SNase and are readily detectable by a simple plate test. A multicloning site (MCS) was introduced just after the cleavage site between leader peptide and the mature SNase, without affecting nuclease activity. Cloning foreign DNA fragments into any site of the MCS interrupts nuc and thus results in nuc mutant clones which are easily distinguished fron nuc+ clones on plates. The utility of this system for L. lactis was demonstrated by cloning an antibiotic resistance marker and Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA fragments into the MCS of the nucMCS cassette. Both cloning vectors containing the nucMCS cassette were also introduced into Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, in which direct screening of nuc mutant recombinant clones was also achieved. The potential uses of nuc as a secretion reporter system are discussed.
TI  - Lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in  fermented dairy products.
AB  - Lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar has been developed for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented dairy products. The medium contains lithium chloride and sodium propionate to inhibit the growth of other lactic acid bacteria. Pure cultures of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococci were tested for growth in this medium. With one exception, all bifidobacteria were able to grow in this medium and in a nonselective agar with a difference not exceeding .4 log units. However, none of the lactobacilli tested and only one strain each of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris grew in lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar. In those cases, the numbers of colonies were lower in lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar by 1.26 and 2.51 log units, respectively, compared with a nonselective agar. Bifidobacteria were also selectively isolated from all fermented milks and cheeses analyzed.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an endopeptidase from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2.
AB  - An endopeptidase has been purified to homogeneity from a crude cell extract of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2 by a procedure that includes diethyl-aminoethane-Sephacel chromatography, phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography over an anion-exchange column and a hydrophobic-interaction column. Gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a molecular mass of the purified enzyme of 70,000 Da. The endopeptidase can degrade several oligopeptides into various tetra-, tri-, and dipeptides. The endopeptidase has no aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase, dipeptidase, or tripeptidase activity. It is optimally active at pH 6.0 to 6.5 and in the temperature range of 30 to 38 degrees C. The enzyme is inactivated by the chemical agents 1,10-phenanthroline, ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate, beta-mercaptoethanol, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and is inhibited by Cu2+ and Zn2+. The ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate- or 1,10-phenanthroline-treated enzyme can be reactivated by Co2+. Immunoblotting with specific antibodies raised against the purified endopeptidase indicated that the enzyme is also present in other Lactococcus spp., as well as in Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of chromosomal promoters of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - A promoter probe vector, pTG244, was constructed with the aim of isolating transcription initiation signals from Streptococcus thermophilus (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). pTG244 is based on the Escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector pTG222, into which the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of Bacillus pumilus (cat-86) was cloned. Random Sau3A fragments from the S. thermophilus A054 chromosomal DNA were cloned upstream of the cat-86 gene by using E. coli as the host. The pool of recombinant plasmids were introduced into S. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in order to search for promoter activity in these hosts. For S. thermophilus, it was necessary to first select erythromycin-resistant transformants and then to screen for chloramphenicol resistance among these. Direct selection of chloramphenicol-resistant clones was, however, possible in L. lactis subsp. lactis. Six fragments exhibiting promoter activity were characterized in S. thermophilus by measuring the levels of cat-86 transcription and/or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specific activity. Three of the promoter-carrying fragments were sequenced. The 5' ends of their corresponding mRNAs were determined by S1 mapping and shown to correspond to a purine residue in all cases. Upstream from these potential transcription start points, sequences homologous to the E. coli sigma 70 and the Bacillus subtilis vegetative sigma 43 (or sigma A) consensus promoters were identified.
TI  - Genome comparison of Lactococcus strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The two restriction enzymes SmaI and ApaI were found to produce distributions of  DNA fragments useful for genome analysis of some lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus) by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The genome size was estimated to be 1750 to 2500 kb depending on the species. Each strain displayed unique restriction patterns; nevertheless, the percentage of the comigrating fragments of two isogenic or closely related strains was about 80% and fell to 20-40% when the patterns of two non-related strains of the same species or two strains belonging to different species were compared.
TI  - Sugar Utilization and Acid Production by Free and Entrapped Cells of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in a Whey Permeate Medium.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis entrapped in k-carrageenan-locust bean gum gel performed similarly to free cells in the conversion of lactose to lactic acid. Bead diameter influenced the fermentation rate. Cells entrapped in smaller beads (0.5 to 1.0 mm) showed higher release rates, higher lactose, glucose, and formic acid utilization, higher galactose accumulation, and higher lactic acid production than did cells entrapped in larger beads (1.0 to 2.0 mm). Values for smaller beads were comparable with those for free cells. Immobilization affected the fermentation rate of lactic acid bacteria, especially Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Entrapped cells of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus demonstrated a lower lactic acid production than did free cells in batch fermentation. The kinetics of the production of formic and pyruvic acids by L. lactis subsp. lactis and S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus are presented.
TI  - The phylogenetic position of Streptococcus and Enterococcus.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes, S. equinus, S. bovis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. rattus, S. cricetus, S. lactis, S. raffinolactis and Enterococcus faecalis have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16S ribosomal RNA. All the organisms form a loose but coherent group that is phylogenetically equivalent to those of lactobacilli, bacilli, the Brochothrix and Listeria group, and related taxa that constitute one of several sublines within the 'Clostridium' branch of Gram-positive eubacteria. Within the Steptococcus-Enterococcus group, organisms fall into three moderately related clusters defined by Enterococcus, the lactic acid streptococci and streptococci of the pyogenic and oral groups, respectively.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
