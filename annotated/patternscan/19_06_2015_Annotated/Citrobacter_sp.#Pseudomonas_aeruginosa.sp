TI  == the influence of environmental bacteria in freshwater stingray wound-healing.
AB  == invasion by bacteria can influence the course of healing of wounds acquired in aquatic environment. in this study, the bacteria present in potamotrygon motoro stingray mucus and in the alto parana river water were identified, and their ability to induce tissue injury and resist antibiotics was determined. biochemical identification analysis showed that 97% of all bacterial isolates were gram negative, aeromonas spp., enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii being the species most prevalent. gelatinase and caseinase were produced by aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas sobria and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. erythrocyte hemolysis assay showed that a. sobria, a. hydrophila and to a lesser  extent, other gram-negative bacteria produced hemolysin. it was also observed that molecules released in culture by these bacteria were toxic to human epithelial cells. antibiogram results showed that 68% of all bacterial isolates were resistant to at least one type of antibiotic, mainly b-lactams. finally, it  was demonstrated that although p. motoro venom was toxic to epithelial cells it did not influence bacterial proliferation. in summary, the results obtained in this work indicate that during the accident, the mucus of p. motoro and the environmental water may transfer into the wound pathogenic multi-resistant bacteria with the potential to cause severe secondary infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of meropenem versus other extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents against 2,085 clinical isolates tested in 13 brazilian centers.
AB  == meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibacterial agent with a very broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it is the second agent of its class to become available in brazil. the in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem was compared with imipenem and four other antimicrobial agents in a multicenter study. this study involved 13 clinical microbiology laboratories, 10 of which came from 8 brazilian states. a total of 2,085 clinical isolates consecutively collected between december 1995 and march 1996 were susceptibility tested using the etest and following the nccls procedures. meropenem inhibited more than 90% of isolates of enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 microg/ml, except for citrobacter sp. (1 microg/ml). generally, meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem against gram-negative organisms and its spectrum of antimicrobial activity was broader than those of all other drugs tested. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem (mic50, 0.38 microg/ml) was approximately 8-fold more active than imipenem (mic 50,3 microg/ml). imipenem was two-to eight-fold more active than meropenem against some gram-positive specees oxacillin, including enterococcus faecalis (mic 50 of 0.75 microg/ml and 2 microg/ml respectively), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic 50 of 0.47 &mul;g/ml and 0.094 microg/ml), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (mic 50 of 0.064 microg/ml and 0.5mg/ml). against streptococcus sp. meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem (mic 50, 0.016 microg/ml). the results of this study may be used to guide empiric therapy in brazil and indicates that meropenem may have an important role in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant strains of bacteria.

TI  == [the resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  == clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. the resistance of 50  strains each of methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus sp. (p. mirabilis 25 strains and p. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (isp), amikacin (amk), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against p. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. isp was effective against all strains except for 14% of mrsa, 2% of proteus sp., and 4% of p. aeruginosa. 2. six strains of mrsa were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases isp exhibited a relatively  low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) compared to the other compounds. 3. four strains of mrsa were resistant to all drugs except isp. mrsa was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. twenty-one strains of mrsa and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both isp and amk. 5. against all strains tested, isp generally exhibited a lower mic compared to amk. these results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, isp is still an aminoglycoside having a  high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.

TI  == [treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in the elderly].
AB  == sixty outpatients at the age of 65 to 75 years with exacerbated chronic bronchitis were treated with antibiotics: amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (20 patients), cefaclor (20 patients) and ciprofloxacin (20 patients). the treatment  course in all the cases was 5 days. bacteriological tests of the sputum specimens and estimation of the isolate antibiotic susceptibility by the disk diffusion method were applied to all the patients before and after the treatment. 73 per cent of the patients had mixed infection. the microflora mainly included various  species of streptococci highly susceptible to the drugs (54 per cent) as well as  highly susceptible strains of pneumococci and hemophilic bacilli (33 and 17 per cent respectively). atypical microflora was detected in 10 per cent of the cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were isolated in 2 cases. acinetobacter sp. slightly susceptible only to ciprofloxacin was isolated in 1 case. citrobacter sp. slightly susceptible to cefaclor and moderately susceptible to ciprofloxacin  was detected in 1 case. enterobacter sp. moderately susceptible only to ciprofloxacin was isolated in 1 case. a positive factor was moderate susceptibility of proteus mirabilis to all the three drugs. in 24 patients (the average age of 54.7 years) the pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin administered under 2 different regimens was studied. the drug was used in a single dose of 400 mg once a day (group 1) or in a dose of 200 mg twice a day (group ii) followed by estimation of the drug concentration in the blood and sputum. the pathogen eradication was stated in 61.5 and 72.7 per cent of the patients in groups i and  ii, respectively. by the results of the treatment with the use of the above mentioned antibiotics in the elderly patients fluoroquinolones should be considered preferable from the clinical and pharmacoeconomic viewpoints.

TI  == a comparative study of the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux api20e and api20ne identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == the danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  == two strains-s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. after application in the surgery ward, two enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. the resistant bacteria, b. cereus and 4 strains of ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. in hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. only one of them was s. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. most of them were isolated from the floor, but  also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. the most dangerous were three gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. they were isolated from the floor (enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (proteus mirabilis) and from the container  with oral mixture in infant ward (ps. malthophilia). many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), citrobacter freundi, ps. aeruginosa, ps. cepacia (2 strains), ps. maltophilia (2  strains) and moraxella. many resistant strains were also present on the walls (e. coli, ps. mirabilis, ps. cepacia, alcaligens, acinetobacter). the resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. klebsiella oxytoca and ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. acinetobacter and pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.

AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antimicrobial activities of a novel cephalosporin derivative, cp6162, possessing a dihydroxypyridone moiety at the c-3 side chain.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a novel cephalosporin derivative, cp6162, possessing a dihydroxypyridone moiety at the c-3 side chain, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo, with ceftazidime, aztreonam and cefoperazone as the reference  antibiotics. cp6162 showed weak or little activity against gram-positive bacteria, but potent activity against clinical isolates of the gram-negative species including strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, ps. cepacia, acinetobacter sp., xanthomonas maltophilia, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii, which were resistant to the reference antibiotics. the mics of cp6162 were only slightly affected by the high producers of beta-lactamases except for cephalosporinase-producing c. freundii. it was, however, affected by the presence of ferric ion. cp6162 showed in-vivo activity paralleling the in-vitro activity, and also showed pharmacokinetic parameters similar to those of ceftazidime in mice and rats.

TI  == antibody coated bacteria in urine of patients with recent spinal injury.
AB  == twenty patients with an acute spinal injury were prospectively studied to assess  the clinical importance of antibody coated bacteria (acb) in the urine and the association among the different bacterial species with a positive antibody coated bacteria test. clinical urinary tract infection was associated with a positive acb test on 45% of occasions. three hundred and ninety nine urine samples containing 541 bacterial isolates were assessed for the presence of acb; 13% were found to be positive and 87% negative for acb; 67% of urines contained a single bacterial isolate. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most commonly associated with clinical urinary tract infection, found in 25% of episodes, followed by proteus mirabilis (17.5%), klebsiella sp (12.5%), and proteus morganii (10%). providencia stuartii, however, was most commonly associated with a positive acb test (found in 17%). other bacteria associated with a positive acb test included klebsiella sp (14%), acinetobacter sp (12.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), citrobacter sp  (11.5%). a positive acb test is not to be expected from a patient with spinal injury who has a catheter in place, and the test may provide a useful guide to identify those patients with an invasive infection. it is doubtful that a decision to treat or not treat bacteriuria could rest on the identification of the bacterial species alone.

TI  == ticarcillin/clavulanate in the treatment of severe peritonitis.
AB  == a prospective study was performed on 50 consecutive patients with secondary peritonitis. all patients received ticarcillin/clavulanate 5.2 g three times daily as initial antibiotic therapy. in 30 patients a primary perforation was found in the gastro-intestinal tract and 20 had post-operative peritonitis. in two thirds of the patients a diffuse peritonitis was found which affected the whole abdomen. thirty-six patients underwent one or two laparotomies and 11 patients had more than three laparotomies. subsequently, 17 patients died. the cause of death was a therapeutic failure as a result of the surgical procedure in ten patients (nine patients with persisting intestinal fistulae, one patient with bleeding), whereas in seven cases antibiotic therapy failed. micro-organisms found in the latter patients were producers of type 1 beta-lactamase (pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter sp., citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens) and enterococci. ticarcillin/clavulanate is characterized by its broad antimicrobial  spectrum against anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and seems, therefore, to be well  suited for initial chemotherapy in patients with diffuse peritonitis.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == lipid a precursor from pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate.
AB  == inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) caused accumulation  of a lipid a precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid a of mature lps. the enzyme ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (cmp-kdo synthetase) from p. aeruginosa is inhibited by the  kdo analog alpha-c-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-d-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (i), and i is effectively delivered to p. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (i) which then inhibits activation of kdo by cmp-kdo synthetase causing accumulation of lipid a precursor and subsequent growth stasis. the major lipid a precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, c12:o, 2oh-c12:o and 3oh-c10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3oh-c12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (m - h)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid a from p. aeruginosa. in contrast, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid a precursors which only contained 3-oh-c14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. this difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid a are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae mics ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode mic: 0.25); mode mics varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for citrobacter; mics ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for serratia. the rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were citrobacter or enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter, with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128. haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly  susceptible (mic less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low  mics (0.03-0.12). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

TI  == selective and differential medium for the primary isolation of members of the proteeae.
AB  == a new differential and selective medium for the isolation of members of the proteeae, pim (proteeae isolation medium) agar, was developed and evaluated. the  medium relies on the ability of all members of the proteeae (with the exception of a very few morganella morganii strains) to produce a dark brown pigment in medium containing dl-tryptophan. an additional differential property, tyrosine degradation, was also demonstrated by the medium. members of the proteeae appeared as dark brown colonies with a halo of clearing of fine tyrosine crystals when cultured on pim agar. occasional strains of citrobacter sp. and pseudomonas  aeruginosa may degrade tyrosine, but none has the ability to produce dark brown pigmentation on pim agar. quantitative recovery studies showed that the addition  of 5 mg of clindamycin per liter suppressed gram-positive bacteria without inhibiting any strains of the proteeae. the addition of 100 mg of colistin per liter made the medium highly selective for strains of the proteeae, but approximately 10% of the strains were not isolated, thus making this formulation  unsuitable for general surveys of the occurrence of members of the proteeae. pim  agar should aid the investigation of episodes of cross infection caused by members of the proteeae and the isolation of the new species of the proteeae recently described.

TI  == in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l.  pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than  or equal to 6.3 mg/l. although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher mic values, and most bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. the overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant  to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. the activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid ph and in urine, but serum had no effect on mics or mbcs. increase in ofloxacin mics for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

AB  == laboratory and clinical studies were performed on cefminox (cmnx, mt-141), a new  cephamycin antibiotic, and results were as follows. antimicrobial activities. mics of cmnx against various clinical isolates were determined with the inoculum  size of 10(6) cells/ml. percentages of strains susceptible to 12.5 micrograms/ml  or less were 4% for s. aureus, 0% for e. faecalis, 100% for e. coli, 81% for k. pneumoniae, 3% for enterobacter sp., 18% for s. marcescens, 90% for p. mirabilis, 88% for indole-positive proteus sp. 100% for s. flexneri, 100% for salmonella sp., 0% for citrobacter sp. and 0% for p. aeruginosa. most of those sensitive strains were inhibited by 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. these activities were better than those of cefmetazole and cefazolin, but were not as good as those of cefoperazone. clinical efficacy three patients with pneumonia, 1 with pneumonia and sepsis, and 1 with urinary tract infection were treated with cmnx daily dose  of 1-4 g for 7-31 days. clinical responses were excellent in 1, good in 3, poor in 2 patients (contained a double case). bacteriological effects were good for e. coli, k. pneumoniae and s. liquefaciens, poor for p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. c. freundii, a. calcoaceticus and e. faecalis were cultured after treatment. no side effect and no abnormal change of laboratory findings were seen in our cases.

AB  == the in vivo activity of cefodizime (hr 221) was compared with that of cefotaxime  (ctx), cefmenoxime, latamoxef, cefazolin and cefmetazole (cmz). the protective effects of hr 221 on experimental infections in mice caused by staphylococcus aureus smith, escherichia coli c-11, proteus vulgaris gn-76 and serratia marcescens no. 2 were directly related to its in vitro activity against these strains. in contrast, the compound showed the smallest ed50 values, among the 5 antibiotics tested (not including cmz), for klebsiella pneumoniae 3k-25 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pi 67 against which it had relatively low in vitro activity, and its ed50 for citrobacter freundii gn-346 was as small as 1.821 mg/mouse in spite of its mic of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. hr 221 exerted potent bactericidal activity against streptococcus pneumoniae sp-1 inoculated into the mouse lung; the duration of action was prolonged. when tested against the e. coli ec-89 infection induced in the rat uterus, the activity of hr 221 given to rats once daily was equal to that of ctx or cmz given at the same dose twice daily.

AB  == the susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. additionally, the mic of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at  a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode mic varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. a few enterobacter and citrobacter strains are resistant. little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == in vitro properties of ceftazidime, a highly active broad-spectrum cephalosporin  with antipseudomonal activity.
AB  == ceftazidime is an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin that exhibits a high level of broad-spectrum activity, with particularly good activity against pseudomonas sp.  although activity in vitro against staphylococci is moderate, the majority of enterobacteria are susceptible, with mic50 values in the range from 0.06 to 4 micrograms/ml. this cephalosporin is also highly active against indole-positive proteus sp, providencia sp, citrobacter sp, and serratia sp, with mic50 values ranging from less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.13 microgram/ml. good activity against pseudomonas sp is a notable feature, with mic90 values in the range of 4  to 8 micrograms/ml. ceftazidime is bactericidal at concentrations identical or close to the mic. antibiotic performance in vitro appears to be unaffected by the presence of body fluids. good stability to hydrolysis by a range of the prevalent beta-lactamases, good penetration into the intact bacterium, and a high affinity  for the essential penicillin-binding proteins combine to account for the broad spectrum and high activity of ceftazidime. comparative in vitro studies have shown ceftazidime to be as active and sometimes more active than available aminoglycoside antibiotics. since the mode of action of ceftazidime differs fundamentally from that of the aminoglycosides, high activity is maintained against the majority of aminoglycoside-resistant isolates. ceftazidime should therefore represent a viable and potentially safer alternative to aminoglycoside  antibiotics.

AB  == the automicrobic system (ams) is capable of identifying most enterobacteriaceae within 8 h and many glucose-nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli after 13 h of incubation. early preliminary results can be readily obtained from the computer as the tests incubate. data with 1,023 bacterial isolates were reviewed to determine the relative accuracy of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 13-h identifications. all automicrobic system identifications with probability (p) values of less than 0.80 were considered equivocal responses which needed supplementary tests before a final report could be issued. analysis of our data suggests that early identifications of morganella morganii, acinetobacter sp., yersinia spp., salmonella spp. (other than salmonella typhi), shigella spp. (other than shigella sonnei), enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas spp. (other than pseudomonas aeruginosa or pseudomonas maltophilia), klebsiella spp. (other than klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca), citrobacter amalonauticus, serratia liquefaciens, or vibrio spp. should be considered nonspecific responses, even when p greater than or equal to 0.80. other identifications reported after 4 h were 96% accurate. at least half of our isolates (60% of our enterobacteriaceae)  could be identified reliably within 4 h, the remaining isolates required longer incubation.
