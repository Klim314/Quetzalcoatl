TI  == prevotella timonensis sp. nov., isolated from a human breast abscess.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic rods were isolated from a human breast abscess. based on  genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, the novel strain belonged to the genus  prevotella. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequence comparisons showed that it was closely related to prevotella buccalis (94 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity), prevotella salivae (90 %) and prevotella oris (89.1 %). the major cellular fatty acid was c(14 : 0) (19.5 %). the new isolate represents a novel species in the genus prevotella, for which the name prevotella timonensis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is strain 4401737(t) (=cip 108522(t)=ccug 50105(t)).
