TI  == a clinical study: melaleuca, manuka, calendula and green tea mouth rinse.
AB  == a novel mouthrinse (ind 61,164) containing essential oils and extracts from four  plant species (melaleuca alternifolia, leptospermum scoparium, calendula officinalis and camellia sinensis) were tested. this study aimed to evaluate the  safety, palatability and preliminary efficacy of the rinse. fifteen subjects completed the phase i safety study. seventeen subjects completed the phase ii randomized placebo-controlled study. plaque was collected, gingival and plaque indices were recorded (baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks). the relative abundance of two periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tanerella forsythensis) was determined utilizing digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. ancova was used at the p = 0.05 level of significance. two subjects reported a minor adverse event. one subject withdrew from the study. several subjects objected to the taste of the test rinse but continued treatment. differences between gingival index, plaque index or relative abundance of either bacterial species did not reach statistical significance when comparing nine placebo subjects with eight test rinse subjects. subjects exposed to the test rinse experienced no abnormal oral lesions, altered vital signs, changes in liver, kidney, or bone marrow function. larger scale studies would be necessary to determine the efficacy and oral health benefits of the test rinse.

TI  == endpoint quantitative pcr assays for bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background: conventional polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for periodontal pathogens are so sensitive that they detect infections of no clinical significance. quantitative pcr (qpcr) may provide a solution to this problem. however, most qpcr systems require expensive real-time thermal cyclers. objective: our goal was to develop qpcr assays which would allow endpoint quantification. materials and methods: 16s rrna primers for bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were adapted to the amplifluor qpcr system, which incorporates fluorescein into the pcr product so that endpoint fluorescence is proportional to the original amount of template. dna dilutions representing known numbers of cells were used as standard curves. pooled subgingival plaques from the four deepest pockets of 21 severe adult periodontitis patients were assayed. buccal molar supragingival plaque from 35 dental students provided healthy controls. endpoint fluorescence was measured with a microplate reader. results: optimized standard curves were linear in log-log or semilog fits over a range of 100-10(6) cells. countable b. forsythus was present in all patients, with counts (as logs) from 2.4 to 7.3 (mean = 5.0), and 11 controls with counts from 2.1 to 4.5 (mean = 3.0). p. gingivalis was present in 11 patients and no controls, with counts from 2.2 to 4.7 (mean = 3.2). a. actinomycetemcomitans was present in two patients, with counts of 1.5 and 3.5. conclusions: amplifluor qpcr assays discriminated between  plaque samples differing by one log or more, allowing major infections to be distinguished from minor ones. this approach allows high-throughput qpcr of plaque samples, using equipment available to many laboratories.

TI  == regulation of matrix metalloproteinase production by cytokines, pharmacological agents and periodontal pathogens in human periodontal ligament fibroblast cultures.
AB  == matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). produced by both infiltrating and resident cells of the periodontium, play a role in physiologic and pathologic events. it is recognized that an imbalance between activated mmps and their endogenous inhibitors leads to pathologic breakdown of the extracellular matrix during periodontitis. to date, little is known about the regulation of mmp synthesis and secretion in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (pdlfs). the purpose of this  study was to examine the effects of cytokines, pharmacological agents (protein synthesis inhibitor and protein kinase c inhibitors) and predominant periodontal  pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis) on  mmp production in human pdlfs using gelatin zymography. the gelatin zymograms revealed that the main gelatinase secreted by human pdlfs migrated at 72 kda and  represents mmp-2. minor gelatinolytic bands were also observed at 92 kda regions  that correspond to mmp-9. we found that a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and il-1alpha can elevate mmp-2 secretion in human pdlfs. these results indicate  that periodontal pathogens and inflammatory cytokines play an important role in tissue destruction and disintegration of extracellular matrix in periodontal diseases. thus, activation of mmps may be one of the distinct host degradative pathways in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. in addition, h7, staurosporine, cycloheximide and tgf-beta could suppress mmp-2 production. agents that target protein synthesis or the protein kinase c pathway in human pdlfs inhibit mmp-2 production, and such inhibition may contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal inflammation. taken together, these findings suggest a possible new therapeutic approach, involving the use of drugs that modify host-response mechanisms to suppress or inhibit mmp-mediated tissue destruction.

TI  == untreated periodontal disease in indonesian adolescents. clinical and microbiological baseline data.
AB  == at present, several risk factors for the initiation and progression of periodontitis have been identified. in order to investigate the role of various potential clinical and microbiological risk factors and indicators, a longitudinal study was initiated in a young population deprived from regular dental care. the present communication describes the baseline cross-sectional data obtained in 1987 in terms of the clinical periodontal condition and prevalence of periodontal bacteria in the oral cavity. all inhabitants in the age range 15-25 years of a village with approximately 2000 inhabitants at a tea estate on western java, indonesia, were examined clinically and microbiologically. in total, 255 adolescents, comprising 130 males and 125 females participated in the study. samples for bacteriological examination were taken from the gingiva, the dorsum of the tongue, and the saliva. plaque index, bleeding upon probing, pocket depth, and attachment loss (al) were scored on the  approximal surfaces from the vestibular aspect of all teeth as well as the mid-vestibular and mid-lingual aspects of the ramfjord teeth. calculus was scored only on the 4 surfaces of the ramfjord teeth. following the clinical measurements, the deepest bleeding pocket with no clinical loss of attachment was sampled for microbiological examination. in addition, in 37 subjects a deep bleeding (> or = 4 mm) with at least 4 mm of attachment loss was sampled. moderate periodontitis (max. al 3-4 mm) was found in 26% of the population, advanced periodontitis (max. al > or = 5 mm) in 8%, whereas 66% of the population showed no or minor periodontitis (max. al 0-2 mm). actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found in 57% of the population, porphyromonas gingivalis in 87%, prevotella intermedia and motile rods in all cases and spirochetes in 89%. p. gingivalis (66%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (37%) and spirochetes (63%) were, of all the sampled sites of the oral cavity, most frequently detected in pockets without attachment loss. motile rods were most prevalent on the tongue and in the saliva (92% and 89%, respectively). a high prevalence of the investigated periodontal bacteria was detected both in the pockets without and with attachment loss. no significant association between the  clinical periodontal parameters and the prevalence of the microorganisms was observed at a patient level. at a site level, both p. gingivalis and spirochetes  were more prevalent in sites with attachment loss. the actual role of these putative periodontal pathogens may be elucidated more extensively, when longitudinal data on the present population become available.

TI  == interdental supragingival plaque--a natural habitat of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that suspected periodontal pathogens form a minor component of the supragingival plaque of individuals without periodontal diseases. twenty-one dental hygienist trainees with a mean age of 23.5 years were twice sampled for interdental plaque between 1st and 2nd molars in all quadrants. the samples were assessed for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and the prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens group of organisms. bacteria of this group were predominantly p. nigrescens and showed both the highest prevalence (100%) and the highest colonization density of the investigated species. seven of 21 samples harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans. serotypes a, b, and c were found in three samples each, while serotype e was present in one sample. three subjects had two different a. actinomycetemcomitans  serotypes. bacteroides forsythus and c. rectus were detected in 10 (48%) and nine (43%) subjects, respectively. the detected cell numbers accounted for approximately 0.01% to 1% of the sampled flora. in contrast, p. gingivalis was found only in a single sample, which in addition harbored b. forsythus, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes b and e), and p. intermedia. these results suggest that the investigated periodontal bacteria are not "exogenous pathogens", but amphibiotic, opportunistic microorganisms which may have a natural habitat in the supragingival plaque of the interproximal area of molars.

TI  == microbiological and clinical monitoring of non-localized juvenile periodontitis in young adults: a report of 11 cases.
AB  == it has been shown that patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) often harbor actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in the subgingival area. however, little is known of the oral microflora in non-ljp juvenile periodontitis patients with less extensive disease. the purpose of this study was to describe the microflora and clinical parameters of young adults with minor to moderate periodontitis during treatment for a period of 1 year. eleven patients 15 to 16 years of age were studied. all of them had 4 to 8 mm loss of attachment at minimally one site, but the typical clinical description of localized juvenile periodontitis was an exclusion criterion in this study. microbiological examination of the deepest periodontal pocket and of the tongue revealed that 6 patients harbored actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 5 harbored porphyromonas gingivalis. almost all subjects showed relatively high proportions  of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, motile organisms, and spirochetes. on the basis of clinical and microbiological parameters the 11 patients could be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. six cases had moderate periodontal breakdown with loss of attachment at 7 to 44 sites. all harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans and 5 of them p. gingivalis. these 6 cases responded relatively well to initial treatment despite the continued presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the other group consisted of 5 cases with relatively minor periodontal breakdown; i.e, 1 or 2 sites with 4 to 6 mm loss of attachment. neither a. actinomycetemcomitans nor p. gingivalis was detected in the deepest pocket of these patients. all 5 responded well to initial treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
