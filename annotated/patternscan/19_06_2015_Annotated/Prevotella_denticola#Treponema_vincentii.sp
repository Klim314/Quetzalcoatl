TI  == relationship between periodontal pocket sulfide levels and subgingival species.
AB  == background: many species implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease produce volatile sulfur compounds (vsc). this investigation examined the relationship between levels of sulfide and subgingival bacterial species in the same periodontal pockets. material and methods: twenty chronic periodontitis subjects were measured clinically at six sites per tooth for plaque, gingivitis,  bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level. subgingival  plaque samples, taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth, were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. sulfide levels were measured at the same sites using a diamond probe/perio 2000 system. clinical and microbiological data were averaged for sulfide-positive and -negative sites separately in each subject and then averaged across subjects. significance differences in clinical and microbial parameters between sulfide-positive and -negative sites were sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. results: mean total dna probe counts (x10(5), +/-sem) at sulfide-negative and -positive sites were 44.0 +/- 9.9 and 65.0 +/- 13.3, respectively (p < 0.01). seventeen species were found at significantly higher levels in sulfide-positive than -negative sites. these included abundant producers of vsc such as members of the genera fusobacterium, campylobacter, prevotella, treponema and eubacterium, and bacteriodes forsythus, selenomonas noxia and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella intermedia, bacteriodes forsythus,  prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and treponema denticola exhibited the greatest difference in mean counts between sulfide-negative and -positive sites. orange and red complex species were at higher counts at shallow (< 4 mm) sulfide-positive than shallow sulfide-negative  sites. although not statistically significant, mean clinical parameters were somewhat higher at sulfide-positive than sulfide-negative sites. conclusions: intra-pocket sulfide levels reflect the levels of sulfide-producing species and may provide useful diagnostic information.

TI  == positive and negative bacterial associations involving dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  == dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. in this study, samples taken from  abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving d. pneumosintes. dna was extracted from the samples, and the presence of d. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by  means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. positive and negative associations involving d. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of d. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. the association between the pairs containing d. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. d. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the  other target species. d. pneumosintes was positively associated with treponema denticola, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. pectinovorum, and t. vincentii. negative associations were observed with bacteroides forsythus, p. gingivalis, and actinomyces israelii. no pair containing d. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). the findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of d. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen,  usually in a mixed infection. positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as t. denticola and p. endodontalis, suggest that  bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.

TI  == relationship of cigarette smoking to the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background: the relationship of cigarette smoking to the composition of the subgingival microbiota is not clear. some studies indicated higher levels of certain species in smokers, while other studies failed to detect differences in the microbiota between subjects with different smoking histories. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prevalence, proportions and levels of the subgingival species in adult subjects who were current, past or never smokers. method: 272 adult subjects ranging in age from 20-86 years with at least 20 teeth were recruited for study. smoking history was obtained using a questionnaire. clinical measures were taken at 6 sites per tooth at all teeth excluding third molars at a baseline visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth excluding third molars in each subject at baseline and assayed individually for counts of 29 subgingival species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. subjects were subset according to smoking history into never (n=124), past (n=98) and current smokers (n=50). uni-variate and multi-variate analyses were used to seek associations between smoking category and the counts, proportions and prevalence of subgingival species. results: greater differences were observed for the prevalence (% of sites colonized) of the test species in the 3 smoking groups than were observed for counts or proportions of total counts. members of the orange and red complexes including e. nodatum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, p. intermedia, p. micros, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly more  prevalent in current smokers than in the other 2 groups. the difference in prevalence between smokers and non-smokers was due to greater colonization at sites with pocket depth <4 mm. stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that combinations of the prevalence of 5 microbial species and pack years accounted for 44% of the variance for mean pocket depth (p<0.000001), while the prevalence of 3 microbial taxa along with age, pack years, current smoking and gender accounted for 31% of the variance in mean attachment level (p<0.000001). the difference in prevalence between current and never smokers of all members of the red complex and 8 of 12 members of the orange complex was significantly greater in the maxilla than in the mandible. conclusions: the major difference between the subgingival microbiota in subjects with different smoking  history was in the prevalence of species rather than counts or proportions. the greater extent of colonization in smokers appeared to be due to greater colonization at pocket depths <4 mm. differences in colonization patterns between current and never smokers were greater in the maxilla than in the mandible.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == antimicrobial action of axol on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial action of axol was tested against a panel of periodontopathic bacteria, which included treponema denticola, treponema vincentii, treponema sp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the axol commercial solution (undiluted) was effective in inhibiting some of the bacteria but not all. the rational for the use of antimicrobials is discussed.

TI  == growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, t. pectinovorum, t. socranskii, and t. vincentii in a chemically defined medium.
AB  == a chemically defined medium, omiz (oral microbiology and immunology, zurich)-w1 was developed. medium omiz-w1 supports the long-term proliferation of a wide range of oral anaerobes, including representative strains of four treponema species and porphyromonas gingivalis. high concentrations of ascorbic acid and ammonium ions proved to be important for the growth of these organisms. t. denticola cd-1 grew in the absence of polyamines and long-chain fatty acids, t. pectinovorum and t. socranskii required polyamines, whereas t. vincentii depended on both polyamines and lecithin for growth. specific requirements for purines and/or pyrimidines were detected, and these requirements could be used to distinguish haemophilus-actinobacillus group organisms. some strains of p. gingivalis grew without vitamin k, while others were not satisfied by menadione but required its precursor 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid. protoporphyrin ix or hemin equally satisfied the porphyrin requirements of p. gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus, whereas ferrous sulfate was more efficiently used as a source of iron than was hemin. the cellular cohesiveness of p. gingivalis increased with high concentrations of hemin in the growth medium. prevotella intermedia, b. forsythus, and several strains of p. gingivalis were more fastidious and required a protein or serum supplement to grow in medium omiz-w1.
