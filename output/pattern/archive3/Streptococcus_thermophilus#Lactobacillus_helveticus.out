effects of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria on the antigenicity of bovine whey proteins.
background: the main whey proteins alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-la) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) are considered as the major allergens in cow's milk. microbial fermentation can produce some proteolytic enzymes, which can induce the degradation of milk protein allergens. in this study, the effects of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria on the antigenicity of alpha-la and beta-lg were investigated using indirect competitive elisa. meanwhile, the proteolysis of milk proteins was detected by tnbs assay and sds-page electrophoresis. results: fermentation by lactic acid bacteria could significantly reduce the antigenicity of alpha-la and beta-lg in skim milk. combined strains of lactobacillus helveticus and streptococcus thermophilus were the most effective in reducing the antigenicity of both whey proteins. in addition, alpha-la and beta-lg antigenicity decreased to a lower value at 6 h of fermentation and at 0.5 d of cold storage by fermentation with the combined strains. the results of tnbs assay and sds-page electrophoresis showed that lactic acid bacteria strains used in this study hydrolysed whey proteins only to a limited extent. conclusion: the fermentation with lactic acid bacteria is an effective way to reduce whey proteins antigenicity.
characterization of bacteriocins produced by strains from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
a result of extensive screening of over 300 strains from the collection of elby bulgaricum, plc, thirty six strains were selected as producers of bacteriocins, active closely related lactic acid bacterial species and some food spoilage bacteria. the selected strains belong to l. helveticus, l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, which are rare bacteriocin producers. nineteen nonidentified producers were characterized by molecular taxonomic approaches--m13 fingerprinting, repetitive pcr, ribotyping and hybridization with species-specific probes, which allowed to affiliate them to the species l. delbrueckii. several strains were found to harbour plasmids of different size. the estimated activity against food borne pathogens makes the isolated substances perspective as safe food preservatives and the producing strains could be used as components of starters with improved quality.
preliminary characterization of microflora of comte cheese.
the evolution of the microflora of three comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. the same starter was used with each type of milk. the comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. starter lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. other microorganisms, i.e. homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. the characterization of strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. the values for the genome size of 11 strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 mbp. the potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.
inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
fermentation of aqueous plant seed extracts by lactic acid bacteria.
the effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (vigna unguiculata), peanut (arachis hypogea), soybean (glycine max), and sorghum (sorghum vulgare) were studied. the bacteria investigated were lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. during fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, ph, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees c. maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, ph, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. the maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in ph. change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. in the extracts inoculated simultaneously with l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, a synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased ph in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. fermented extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.
