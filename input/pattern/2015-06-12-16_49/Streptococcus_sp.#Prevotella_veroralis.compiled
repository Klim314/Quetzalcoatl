TI  - The microbial community of the cystic fibrosis airway is disrupted in early life.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular techniques have uncovered vast numbers of organisms in the  cystic fibrosis (CF) airways, the clinical significance of which is yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to describe and compare the microbial communities of the lower airway of clinically stable children with CF and children without CF. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and paired oropharyngeal swabs from clinically stable children with CF (n = 13) and BAL from children without CF (n = 9) were collected. DNA was isolated, the 16S rRNA regions amplified, fragmented, biotinylated and hybridised to a 16S rRNA microarray. Patient medical and demographic information was recorded and standard microbiological culture was performed. RESULTS: A diverse bacterial community was detected in the lower airways of children with CF and children without CF. The airway microbiome of clinically stable children with CF and children without CF were significantly different as measured by Shannon's Diversity Indices (p = 0.001; t test) and Principle coordinate analysis (p = 0.01; Adonis test). Overall the CF airway microbial community was more variable and had a less even distribution than the microbial community in the airways of children without CF. We highlighted several bacteria of interest, particularly Prevotella veroralis, CW040 and a Corynebacterium, which were of significantly differential abundance between the CF and non-CF lower airways. Both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae culture abundance were found to be associated with CF airway microbial community structure. The CF upper and lower airways were found to have a broadly similar microbial milieu. CONCLUSION: The microbial communities in the lower airways of stable children with CF and children without CF show significant differences in overall diversity. These discrepancies indicate a disruption of the airway microflora occurring early in life in children with CF.
TI  - Molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  - AIM: Compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a UK population using culture-independent techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Halitosis patients were screened according to our recently developed recruitment protocol. Scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. Bacteria were identified by PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: The predominant species found in the control samples were Lysobacter-type species, Streptococcus salivarius, Veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Atopobium parvulum and Veillonella atypica. In the halitosis samples, Lysobacter-type species, S. salivarius, Prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, Prevotella veroralis and Prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. For the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). In the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. CONCLUSIONS: The microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.
TI  - New findings on the microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  - The predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. Microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'Streptococcus milleri'-group, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, the Prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, P. intermedia, P. oralis and unidentified Prevotella spp. Two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas Prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. The large proportion of non-pigmented Prevotella species, P. asaccharolytica and B. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. The role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'Streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.
