TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == bacterial diversity in meconium of preterm neonates and evolution of their fecal  microbiota during the first month of life.
AB  == the establishment and succession of bacterial communities in infants may have a profound impact in their health, but information about the composition of meconium microbiota and its evolution in hospitalized preterm infants is scarce.  in this context, the objective of this work was to characterize the microbiota of meconium and fecal samples obtained during the first 3 weeks of life from 14 donors using culture and molecular techniques, including dgge and the human intestinal tract chip (hitchip) analysis of 16s rrna amplicons. culture techniques offer a quantification of cultivable bacteria and allow further study  of the isolate, while molecular techniques provide deeper information on bacterial diversity. culture and hitchip results were very similar but the former showed lower sensitivity. inter-individual differences were detected in the microbiota profiles although the meconium microbiota was peculiar and distinct from that of fecal samples. bacilli and other firmicutes were the main bacteria groups detected in meconium while proteobacteria dominated in the fecal samples.  culture technique showed that staphylococcus predominated in meconium and that enterococcus, together with gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, escherichia fergusonii, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, was more abundant in fecal samples. in addition, hitchip results showed the prevalence of  bacteria related to lactobacillus plantarum and streptococcus mitis in meconium samples whereas those related to enterococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia predominated in the 3(rd) week feces. this study highlights that spontaneously-released meconium of preterm neonates contains a specific microbiota that differs from that of feces obtained after the first week of life. our findings indicate that the presence of serratia was strongly associated with a higher degree of immaturity and other hospital-related parameters, including antibiotherapy and mechanical ventilation.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == real-time pcr analysis of the intestinal microbiotas in peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  == bifidobacterium and lactobacillus can beneficially affect the host by producing acetic acid and lactic acid, which lower ph and thereby inhibit the growth of pathogens or allow the probiotic bacteria to compete with pathogens for epithelial adhesion sites and nutrients. the transmural migration of enteric organisms into the peritoneal cavity can cause peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis (pd) patients. we hypothesized that the composition of the intestinal microbiota  with regard to lactobacillus species and bifidobacterium species differed between pd patients and healthy controls. the aim of the study was to investigate these differences by real-time pcr analysis of fecal samples. from 1 august 2009 to 31  march 2010, a total of 29 nondiabetic pd patients and 41 healthy controls from china medical university hospital were recruited after giving their informed consent. fecal samples were collected from the pd patients and their age-matched  counterparts in the morning using a standardized procedure. dna extracted from these samples was analyzed by real-time pcr. all bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium  catenulatum, b. longum, b. bifidum, lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei, and klebsiella pneumoniae were less frequently detected in the patient samples. dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) may impair intestinal barrier function and increase host vulnerability to pathogen invasion. further studies are necessary to confirm our findings before clinical trials with probiotic supplementation in  pd patients.

TI  == structure of plantaricin locus of lactobacillus plantarum 8p-a3.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum 8p-a3 is a strain which is well known on the russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. the strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. l. plantarum 8p-a3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae strains. dna sequence analysis of l. plantarum 8p-a3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins ef and  nc8. the plantaricin locus found in l. plantarum 8p-a3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in l. plantarum j51.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == preservation of viability and antibacterial activity of lactobacillus spp. in calcium alginate beads.
AB  == the objective of the study was to produce calcium alginate beads able to deliver  lactobacillus spp. (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus bulgaricus and lactobacillus lactis) with preserved viability and antibacterial activity. four types of beads, containing entrapped (e), surface and entrapped (es), surface (s) and concentrated surface and entrapped lactobacilli (c(es)) were prepared and physically characterized. the antibacterial activity of lactobacilli cultures before and after immobilization,  freeze-drying and throughout storage was studied in relationship to the viable number of lactobacilli. multi-resistant clinical isolates (methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, vancomycine-resistant enterococcus faecalis, vim-2-metalo-beta-lactamase producing pseudomonas aeruginosa and ctx-m-15-beta-lactamase producing strains: escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were used as indicator strains. alginate beads in which lactobacilli  proliferated to the beads surface (es and c(es)) differed significantly from the  other types of beads in their physicochemical properties, showing smoother surface morphology, more spherical shape, bigger weight, lower calcium content, density and crushing force. lactobacilli cultures, at high cell concentrations (10(8)cfu/ml) were active against both gram-positive and negative multi-resistant bacteria. beads containing both entrapped and surface lactobacilli (es) resulted  in viability and antibacterial activity most similar to non-processed lactobacilli cultures. the viability and antibacterial activity of the immobilized lactobacilli remained stable after 6 months storage.

TI  == the microbiota of lafun, an african traditional cassava food product.
AB  == lafun is a fermented cassava food product consumed in parts of west africa. in the present work the microorganisms (aerobic bacteria (ab), lactic acid bacteria  (lab) and yeasts) associated with the fermentation of lafun under traditional conditions have for the first time been studied using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods. during lafun fermentation the ab count ranged from 6-7 log(10) cfu/g at the beginning to 9 log(10) cfu/g at the end. similarly, the number of lab increased from 5 log(10) cfu/g to 9 log(10) cfu/g during the process while the yeast load increased from 3 log(10) cfu/g at the onset of the fermentation to 5-6 log(10) cfu/g at the end of the fermentation. a total of 168 isolates (31 ab, 88 lab, and 49 yeasts) were isolated and identified by means of phenotypic tests, pcr-based methods and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the aerobic bacteria were mostly  identified as belonging to the bacillus cereus group (71%). the b. cereus isolates lacked the genetic determinant specific for cereulide producers but harboured several genes encoding the heat-labile toxins hemolysin bl and nonhemolytic enterotoxin as detected by pcr. the other aerobic bacteria isolated  were gram negative and identified as klebsiella pneumoniae and pantoea agglomerans. the dominant lab were identified as lactobacillus fermentum (42% of  lab isolates) followed by lactobacillus plantarum (30%) and weissella confusa (18%). seven isolates remained unidentified and constitute probably a novel lab species. the predominant yeast species associated with lafun fermentation were saccharomyces cerevisiae (22% of yeast isolates), pichia scutulata (20%), kluyveromyces marxianus (18%), hanseniaspora guilliermondii (12%), pichia rhodanensis (8%) and candida glabrata (8%) as well as pichia kudriavzevii, candida tropicalis and trichosporon asahii at lower incidence (<5% each).

TI  == antimicrobial activity of long-chain, water-soluble, dendritic tricarboxylato amphiphiles.
AB  == objectives: to measure the antimicrobial activities of three series of homologous, dendritic tricarboxylato (three-headed) amphiphiles against a battery of bacteria and fungi. methods: three series of homologous dendritic amphiphiles  were synthesized containing c13 to c22 fatty chains. susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus plantarum, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), mycobacterium smegmatis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans and aspergillus niger to the amphiphiles was measured by broth microdilution and reported as the mic. results: several amphiphiles from each homologous series, designed and constructed to overcome the low solubility of saturated long-chain fatty acids, had antimicrobial activity against mrsa (mic =  36 mg/l), c. albicans (mic = 4.4 mg/l), s. cerevisiae (mic = 1.1 mg/l) and m. smegmatis (mic = 8.9 mg/l). these amphiphiles had considerably better antimicrobial activities than the corresponding saturated fatty acids. alkyl chain length influenced the values of mic; longer chains (c18-c22) were generally more antimicrobial, but there was no uniform pattern among the microorganisms tested. conclusions: as the antimicrobial activity of the amphiphiles increased with increasing chain length, it is anticipated that maximum activity was not reached with these series. thus, the identification of the optimal chain length would provide a target compound for development of low-cost, topical microbicides and anti-infectives. further, these series of dendritic amphiphiles with the very long chains can be used as new water-soluble probes for elucidation of membrane structure and for identification of novel targets for antimicrobial design.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == optimization of bacteriocin production by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  == the cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin st13br, produced by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, inhibits the growth of l. casei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. based on tricine-sds-page, bacteriocin st13br is 10 kda in size. complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after  treatment with proteinase k, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. low bacteriocin activity (200 au/ml) was recorded in bhi medium, m17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 au/ml) was recorded after 23 h in mrs broth, but only at 30 degrees c. tween 80 in mrs broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in mrs broth, stimulated bacteriocin  production (6,400 au/ml). only 50% activity (3,200 au/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 au/ml. bacteriocin production was not stimulated  by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 au/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 au/ml). activity levels less than  200 au/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 au/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. the presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher kh(2)po(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.

TI  == inhibition of microbial growth by ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound derived from garlic.
AB  == ajoene, a garlic-derived sulfur-containing compound that prevents platelet aggregation, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium smegmatis, and streptomyces griseus, was inhibited at 5 micrograms of ajoene per  ml. staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus plantarum also were inhibited below 20 micrograms of ajoene per ml. for gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and xanthomonas maltophilia, mics were between 100 and 160 micrograms/ml. ajoene also inhibited yeast growth at concentrations below 20 micrograms/ml. the microbicidal effect of ajoene on growing cells was observed at slightly higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. b. cereus and saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed at 30 micrograms of ajoene per ml after 24 h of cultivation when cultivation was started at 10(5) cells per ml. however, the minimal microbicidal concentrations for resting cells were at 10 to 100 times higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. the disulfide bond in ajoene appears to be necessary for the antimicrobial activity of ajoene, since reduction by cysteine, which reacts with disulfide bonds, abolished its antimicrobial activity.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
