TI  == occurrence of bacteriophages infecting aeromonas, enterobacter, and klebsiella in water and association with contamination sources in thailand.
AB  == the co-residence of bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts in humans, animals,  and environmental sources directed the use of bacteriophages to track the origins of the pathogenic bacteria that can be found in contaminated water. the objective of this study was to enumerate bacteriophages of aeromonas caviae (aecaks148), enterobacter sp. (enspks513), and klebsiella pneumoniae (klpnks648) in water and  evaluate their association with contamination sources (human vs. animals). bacterial host strains were isolated from untreated wastewater in bangkok, thailand. a double-layer agar technique was used to detect bacteriophages. all three bacteriophages were detected in polluted canal samples, with likely contamination from human wastewater, whereas none was found in non-polluted river samples. aecaks148 was found to be associated with human fecal sources, while enspks513 and klpnks648 seemed to be equally prevalent in both human and animal fecal sources. both bacteriophages were also present in polluted canals that could receive contamination from other fecal sources or the environment. in conclusion, all three bacteriophages were successfully monitored in bangkok, thailand. this study provided an example of bacteriophages for potential use as source identifiers of pathogen contamination. the results from this study will assist in controlling sources of pathogen contamination, especially in developing countries.

TI  == occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == comparison of the antimicrobial tolerance of oxytetracycline-resistant heterotrophic bacteria isolated from hospital sewage and freshwater fishfarm water in belgium.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between antimicrobial tolerance and taxonomic diversity among the culturable oxytetracycline-resistant  (ot(r)) heterotrophic bacterial population in two belgian aquatic sites receiving wastewater either from human medicine or from aquaculture. the study of ot(r) heterotrophs and mesophilic aeromonas spp. allowed comparison of tolerance data at the intergenus as well as at the intragenus level. in total, 354 independently obtained ot(r) isolates were subjected to antimicrobial tolerance testing and identified by glc analysis of their cellular fatty acid methyl esters (fames), by api 20e profiling and/or by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (faflp) dna fingerprinting. in general, ot(r) hospital heterotrophs displayed a higher frequency (84%) of ampicillin (amp) tolerance compared to the ot(r) heterotrophs from the freshwater fishfarm site (22%). fame results indicated that this effect was linked to the predominance of intrinsically ampicillin-resistant  ot(r) aeromonas strains over representatives of acinetobacter and escherichia coli within the hospital strain set. among the ot(r) mesophilic aeromonas strain  set, the global tolerance profiles of the two sites only differed in a higher number of kanamycin (kan) -tolerant strains (43%) for hospital aeromonads in comparison with the fishfarm aeromonads (8%). to some extent, this finding was correlated with the specific presence of aeromonas caviae dna hybridisation group (hg) 4. collectively, these results suggest that the profiles for amp and kan tolerance observed in both sites arose from taxonomic differences in the culturable ot(r) bacterial population at the generic or subgeneric level. in addition, our identification data also revealed that enterobacter sp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and a. veronii biovar sobria hg8 may be considered  potential indicator organisms to assess microbial tolerance in various compartments of the aquatic environment.
