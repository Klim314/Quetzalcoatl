TI  == oral treatment of chickens with lactobacillus reuteri lm1 reduces brachyspira pilosicoli-induced pathology.
AB  == avian intestinal spirochaetosis (ais) results from the colonization of the caeca  and colon of poultry by pathogenic brachyspira, notably brachyspira pilosicoli. following the ban on the use of antibiotic growth promoters in the european union in 2006, the number of cases of ais has increased, which, alongside emerging antimicrobial resistance in brachyspira, has driven renewed interest in alternative intervention strategies. lactobacillus-based probiotics have been shown to protect against infection with common enteric pathogens in livestock. our previous studies have shown that lactobacillus reuteri lm1 antagonizes aspects of the pathobiology of brachyspira in vitro. here, we showed that l. reuteri lm1 mitigates the clinical symptoms of ais in chickens experimentally challenged with b. pilosicoli. two groups of 15 commercial laying hens were challenged experimentally by oral gavage with b. pilosicoli b2904 at 18 weeks of  age; one group received unsupplemented drinking water and the other received l. reuteri lm1 in drinking water from 1 week prior to challenge with brachyspira and thereafter for the duration of the study. this treatment regime was protective. specifically, b. pilosicoli was detected by culture in fewer birds, bird weights  were higher, faecal moisture contents were significantly lower (p<0.05) and egg production as assessed by egg weight and faecal staining score was improved (p<0.05). also, at post-mortem examination, significantly fewer b. pilosicoli were recovered from treated birds (p<0.05), with only mild-moderate histopathological changes observed. these data suggest that l. reuteri lm1 may be a useful tool in the control of ais.

TI  == lactobacilli antagonize the growth, motility, and adherence of brachyspira pilosicoli: a potential intervention against avian intestinal spirochetosis.
AB  == avian intestinal spirochetosis (ais) results from the colonization of the ceca and colorectum of poultry by pathogenic brachyspira species. the number of cases  of ais has increased since the 2006 european union ban on the use of antibiotic growth promoters, which, together with emerging antimicrobial resistance in brachyspira, has driven renewed interest in alternative intervention strategies.  probiotics have been reported as protecting livestock against infection with common enteric pathogens, and here we investigate which aspects of the biology of brachyspira they antagonize in order to identify possible interventions against ais. the cell-free supernatants (cfs) of two lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus reuteri lm1 and lactobacillus salivarius lm2, suppressed the growth of brachyspira pilosicoli b2904 in a ph-dependent manner. in in vitro adherence and  invasion assays with ht29-16e three-dimensional (3d) cells and in a novel avian cecal in vitro organ culture (ivoc) model, the adherence and invasion of b. pilosicoli in epithelial cells were reduced significantly by the presence of lactobacilli (p < 0.001). in addition, live and heat-inactivated lactobacilli inhibited the motility of b. pilosicoli, and electron microscopic observations indicated that contact between the lactobacilli and brachyspira was crucial in inhibiting both adherence and motility. these data suggest that motility is essential for b. pilosicoli to adhere to and invade the gut epithelium and that any interference of motility may be a useful tool for the development of control  strategies.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.
