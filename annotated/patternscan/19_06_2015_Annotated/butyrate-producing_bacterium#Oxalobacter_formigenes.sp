TI  == transfer of intestinal microbiota from lean donors increases insulin sensitivity  in individuals with metabolic syndrome.
AB  == alterations in intestinal microbiota are associated with obesity and insulin resistance. we studied the effects of infusing intestinal microbiota from lean donors to male recipients with metabolic syndrome on the recipients' microbiota composition and glucose metabolism. subjects were assigned randomly to groups that were given small intestinal infusions of allogenic or autologous microbiota. six weeks after infusion of microbiota from lean donors, insulin sensitivity of recipients increased (median rate of glucose disappearance changed from 26.2 to 45.3 mumol/kg/min; p < .05) along with levels of butyrate-producing intestinal microbiota. intestinal microbiota might be developed as therapeutic agents to increase insulin sensitivity in humans; www.trialregister.nl; registered at the dutch trial register (ntr1776).
