TI  == rna-stable-isotope probing shows utilization of carbon from inulin by specific bacterial populations in the rat large bowel.
AB  == knowledge of the trophisms that underpin bowel microbiota composition is required in order to understand its complex phylogeny and function. stable-isotope ((13)c)-labeled inulin was added to the diet of rats on a single occasion in order to detect utilization of inulin-derived substrates by particular members of the cecal microbiota. cecal digesta from fibruline-inulin-fed rats was collected  prior to (0 h) and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 h following provision of the [(13)c]inulin diet. rna was extracted from these cecal specimens and fractionated in isopycnic  buoyant density gradients in order to detect (13)c-labeled nucleic acid originating in bacterial cells that had metabolized the labeled dietary constituent. rna extracted from specimens collected after provision of the labeled diet was more dense than 0-h rna. sequencing of 16s rrna genes amplified  from cdna obtained from these fractions showed that bacteroides uniformis, blautia glucerasea, clostridium indolis, and bifidobacterium animalis were the main users of the (13)c-labeled substrate. culture-based studies of strains of these bacterial species enabled trophisms associated with inulin and its hydrolysis products to be identified. b. uniformis utilized fibruline-inulin for  growth, whereas the other species used fructo-oligosaccharide and monosaccharides. thus, rna-stable-isotope probing (rna-sip) provided new information about the use of carbon from inulin in microbiota metabolism.

TI  == intestinal bacteroides species associated with coeliac disease.
AB  == aims: to characterise the predominant species of bacterial populations associated with duodenal biopsies of paediatric patients with active and treated coeliac disease. methods: 20 biopsy specimens from patients with active coeliac disease,  12 from patients with treated coeliac disease, and eight from age-matched controls were evaluated for comparative purposes. bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations were analysed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers. results: bacteroides diversity was higher in biopsy specimens from controls than in those from patients with active and treated coeliac disease. bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis/bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides ovatus were more abundant in controls than in patients with coeliac disease (p<0.05). bacteroides vulgatus was more frequently detected in controls than in patients with treated coeliac disease (p<0.01). bacteroides dorei was more common in patients with active coeliac disease than in those with treated coeliac disease and control children (p<0.01). bifidobacterium diversity was higher in patients with coeliac disease than in controls. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis were more prevalent in patients with active coeliac disease than in patients with treated coeliac disease and control children. a higher lab diversity was found in patients with treated coeliac disease and controls than in patients with active coeliac disease. weissella spp and lactobacillus fermentum were more frequently detected  in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls and patients with active coeliac disease. conclusions: bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lab populations in the duodenum of spanish children with typical coeliac disease (active and treated) and controls differ in diversity and species composition; this could contribute to features of the disease.
