TI  == comparative genomics of the dairy isolate streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 against related members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  == background: within the genus streptococcus, only streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. members of the sbsec have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 to the other sbsec genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. results: despite the fact that the sbsec species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus infantarius cj18 and streptococcus pasteurianus atcc 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. in addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of s. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. analysis of the s. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy lactococcus lactis and s. thermophilus as potential donors. in addition, s. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in s. gallolyticus. for example, s. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of s. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy s. infantarius cj18, but also for the blood isolate s. pasteurianus atcc 43144. conclusions: our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of s. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. during this  process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. finally, s. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative sbsec virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  == prevalence and comparison of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus in raw and fermented dairy products from east and west africa.
AB  == streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus are members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) associated with human infections. sbsec-related endocarditis was  furthermore associated with rural residency in southern europe. sbsec members are increasingly isolated as predominant species from fermented dairy products in europe, asia and africa. african variants of sii displayed dairy adaptations to lactose metabolism paralleling those of streptococcus thermophilus including genome decay. in this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of sii and possibly other sbsec members in dairy products of east and west africa in order to identify their habitat, estimate their importance in dairy fermentation processes and determine geographic areas affected by this potential health risk.  presumptive sbsec members were isolated on semi-selective m17 and sm agar media.  subsequent genotypic identification of isolates was based on rep-pcr fingerprinting and sbsec-specific16s rrna gene pcr assay. detailed identification was achieved through application of novel primers enhancing the binding stringency in partial groes/groel gene amplification and subsequent dna sequencing. the presence of s. thermophilus-like lacs and lacz genes in the sbsec isolates was determined to elucidate the prevalence of this dairy adaptation. isolates (n = 754) were obtained from 72 raw and 95 fermented milk samples from cote d'ivoire and kenya on semi-selective agar media. colonies of sii were not detected from raw milk despite high microbial titers of approximately 10(6)cfu/ml on m17 agar medium. however, after spontaneous milk fermentation sii was genotypically identified in 94.1% of kenyan samples and 60.8% of kenyan isolates. sii prevalence in cote d'ivoire displayed seasonal variations in samples from 32.3% (june) to 40.0% (dec/jan) and isolates from 20.5% (june) to 27.7% (dec/jan) present at titers of 10(6)-10(8)cfu/ml. lacs and lacz genes were detected in all  kenyan and 25.8% (june) to 65.4% (dec/jan) of ivorian sii isolates. regional differences in prevalence of sii and dairy adaptations were observed, but no clear effect of dairy animal, fermentation procedure and climate was revealed. conclusively, the high prevalence of sii in kenya, cote d'ivoire in addition to somalia, sudan and mali strongly indicates a pivotal role of sii in traditional african dairy fermentations potentially paralleling that of typical western dairy species s. thermophilus. putative health risks associated with the consumption of high amounts of live sii and potential different degrees of evolutionary adaptation or ecological colonization require further epidemiologic and genomic investigations, particularly in africa.

TI  == comparative genome analysis of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius cj18, an african fermented camel milk isolate with adaptations to dairy environment.
AB  == background: streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex associated with several human and animal infections. sii is a predominant bacterium in spontaneously fermented  milk products in africa. the genome sequence of sii strain cj18 was compared with that of other streptococcus species to identify dairy adaptations including genome decay such as in streptococcus thermophilus, traits for its competitiveness in spontaneous milk fermentation and to assess potential health risks for consumers. results: the genome of sii cj18 harbors several unique regions in comparison to sii atcc baa-102t, among others an enlarged exo- and capsular polysaccharide operon; streptococcus thermophilus-associated genes; a region containing metabolic and hypothetical genes mostly unique to cj18 and the  dairy isolate streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus; and a second oligopeptide transport operon. dairy adaptations in cj18 are reflected by a high  percentage of pseudogenes (4.9%) representing genome decay which includes the inactivation of the lactose phosphotransferase system (laciiabc) by multiple transposases integration. the presence of lacs and lacz genes is the major dairy  adaptation affecting lactose metabolism pathways also due to the disruption of laciiabc.we constructed mutant strains of lacs, lacz and laciiabc and analyzed the resulting strains of cj18 to confirm the redirection of lactose metabolism via lacs and lacz.natural competence genes are conserved in both sii strains, but cj18 contains a lower number of crispr spacers which indicates a reduced defense  capability against alien dna. no classical streptococcal virulence factors were detected in both sii strains apart from those involved in adhesion which should be considered niche factors. sii-specific virulence factors are not described. several sii-specific regions encoding uncharacterized proteins provide new leads  for virulence analyses and investigation of the unclear association of dairy and  clinical sii with human diseases. conclusions: the genome of the african dairy isolate sii cj18 clearly differs from the human isolate atcc baa-102t. cj18 possesses a high natural competence predisposition likely explaining the enlarged genome. metabolic adaptations to the dairy environment are evident and especially lactose uptake corresponds to s. thermophilus. genome decay is not as advanced as in s. thermophilus (10-19%) possibly due to a shorter history in dairy fermentations.

TI  == novel streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius variants harboring lactose metabolism genes homologous to streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) commonly associated with human and animal infections. we elucidated the lactose metabolism of s. infantarius subsp.  infantarius predominant in african fermented milk products. s. infantarius subsp. infantarius isolates (n = 192) were identified in 88% of spontaneously fermented  camel milk suusac samples (n = 24) from kenya and somalia at log(1)(0) 8.2-8.5 cfu ml(-)(1). african s. infantarius isolates excreted stoichiometric amounts of  galactose when grown on lactose, exhibiting a metabolism similar to streptococcus thermophilus and distinct from their type strain. african s. infantarius subsp. infantarius cj18 harbors a regular gal operon with 99.7-100% sequence identity to s. infantarius subsp. infantarius atcc baa-102(t) and a gal-lac operon with 91.7-97.6% sequence identity to s. thermophilus, absent in all sequenced sbsec strains analyzed. the expression and functionality of lacz was demonstrated in a  beta-galactosidase assay. the gal-lac operon was identified in 100% of investigated s. infantarius isolates (n = 46) from suusac samples and confirmed in malian fermented cow milk isolates. the african s. infantarius variant potentially evolved through horizontal gene transfer of an s. thermophilus-homologous lactose pathway. safety assessments are needed to identify any putative health risks of this novel s. infantarius variant.

TI  == transcriptional analysis of the gdha gene in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == aims: to study the transcriptional analysis of glutamate dehydrogenase gene, involved in the amino acid conversion to aroma compound in streptococcus thermophilus. methods and results: analysis of the gdha gene nucleotide sequence  of s. thermophilus cnrz1066 revealed that the coding region is 1353 nucleotides long. the deduced amino acids sequence exhibits the putative gdh active site and  some conserved domains characteristic of family i of hexameric gdhs. phylogenetic analysis revealed that the gdh gene of s. thermophilus clustered with the orthologues of other streptococci such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus infantarius. studying the structural organization of the gdha locus the amino acid similarity of gdhs was higher than 87%, but the locus organization was not conserved. a dominant transcript of approximately 1.4  kbp was revealed by northern blot hybridization, suggesting that gdha mrna is monocystronic. primer extension showed that transcription start point of gdha was localized 43 bp upstream of the potential start codon (atg). conclusions: the gdha represents a monocistronic operon highly conserved in phylogenetic-related bacteria. significance and impact of the study: a deeper knowledge of gdh transcriptional mechanisms could lead to develop s. thermophilus industrial starter cultures with optimized aromatic properties.
