TI  - Antiviral, Antifungal and Antibacterial Activities of a BODIPY-Based Photosensitizer.
AB  - Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI) employing the BODIPY-based photosensitizer 2,6-diiodo-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)-4,4'-difluoro-boradiazainda cene (DIMPy-BODIPY) was explored in an in vitro assay against six species of bacteria (eight total strains), three species of yeast, and three viruses as a complementary approach to their current drug-based or non-existent treatments. Our best results achieved a noteworthy 5-6 log unit reduction in CFU at 0.1 muM for Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-2913), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (ATCC-44), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (ATCC-2320), a 4-5 log unit reduction for Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC-19606 (0.25 muM), multidrug resistant A. baumannii ATCC-1605 (0.1 muM), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-97 (0.5 muM), and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-2146 (1 muM), and a 3 log unit reduction for Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 (ATCC-700084). A 5 log unit reduction in CFU was observed for Candida albicans ATCC-90028 (1 muM) and Cryptococcus neoformans ATCC-64538 (0.5 muM), and a 3 log unit reduction was noted for Candida glabrata ATCC-15545 (1 muM). Infectivity was reduced by 6 log units in dengue 1 (0.1 muM), by 5 log units (0.5 muM) in vesicular stomatitis virus, and by 2 log units (5 muM) in human adenovirus-5. Overall, the results demonstrate that DIMPy-BODIPY exhibits antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal photodynamic inactivation at nanomolar concentrations and short illumination times.
TI  - Microbiology and antibiotic resistance in severe burns patients: A 5 year review  in an adult burns unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections are a major problem in burns patients. Knowledge of the incidence and antimicrobial sensitivities of the microorganisms commonly encountered within each institution's burns unit is important as it informs and directs empiric antibiotic therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients admitted from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012 to an adult burns intensive care unit. Specimens chosen for analysis were wound swabs, blood cultures, venous catheter tips, tracheal aspirates, sputum, urine and wound tissue. Records were accessed from the admission register and laboratory information system to obtain the relevant data. RESULTS: During the study period, 352 patients were admitted to the adult burns intensive care unit, of which, 341 patients were included. The mortality rate was 44.6%. Flame burns were the commonest. Mortality rate amongst patients with bacteremia was 46.9%. Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were found to be the most common organisms cultured in most specimens. CONCLUSION: The main three organisms identified in specimen cultures in our adult burns intensive care unit were A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and MRSA. This study has helped establish a better empiric approach to the management of our septic burns patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Copper Alloys Against Invasive Multidrug-Resistant Nosocomial Pathogens.
AB  - The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance demanded novel approaches for the prevention of nosocomial infections, and metallic copper surfaces have been suggested as an alternative for the control of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in surfaces in the hospital environment. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of copper material for invasive MDR nosocomial pathogens isolated over time, in comparison to stainless steel. Clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n:4), OXA-23 and OXA-58 positive, MDR Acinetobacter baumannii (n:6) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n:4) were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity of coupons containing 99 % copper and a brass alloy containing 63 % copper was assessed against stainless steel. All the materials demonstrated statistically significant differences within each other for the logarithmic reduction of microorganisms. Among the three materials, the highest reduction of microorganisms was seen in 99 % copper and the least in stainless steel. The result was statistically significant especially for 0, 2, and 4 h (P = 0.05). 99 % copper showed a bactericidal effect at less than 1 h for MRSA and at 2 h for P. aeruginosa. 63 % copper showed a bactericidal effect at 24 h for P. aeruginosa strains only. Stainless steel surfaces exhibited a bacteriostatic effect after 6 h for P. aeruginosa strains only. 99 % copper reduced the number of bacteria used significantly, produced a bactericidal effect and was more effective than 63 % copper. The use of metallic copper material could aid in reducing the concentration of bacteria, especially for invasive nosocomial pathogens on hard surfaces in the hospital environment.
TI  - Device-associated infection rates and bacterial resistance in six academic teaching hospitals of Iran: Findings from the International Nocosomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC).
AB  - Device-associated health care-acquired infections (DA-HAIs) pose a threat to patient safety, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, few data regarding DA-HAI rates and their associated bacterial resistance in ICUs from Iran are available. A DA-HAI surveillance study was conducted in six adult and pediatric ICUs in academic teaching hospitals in Tehran using CDC/NHSN definitions. We collected prospective data regarding device use, DA-HAI rates, and lengths of stay from 2584 patients, 16,796 bed-days from one adult ICU, and bacterial profiles and bacterial resistance from six ICUs. Among the DA-HAIs, there were 5.84 central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABs) per 1000 central line-days, 7.88 ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs) per 1000 mechanical ventilator-days and 8.99 catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) per 1000 urinary catheter-days. The device utilization ratios were 0.44 for central lines, 0.42 for mechanical ventilators and 1.0 for urinary catheters. The device utilization ratios of mechanical ventilators and urinary catheters were higher than those reported in the ICUs of the INICC and the CDC's NHSN reports, but central line use was lower. The DA-HAI rates in this study were higher than the CDC's NHSN report. However, compared with the INICC report, the VAP rate in our study was lower, while the CLAB rate was similar and the CAUTI rate was higher. Nearly 83% of the samples showed a mixed-type infection. The most frequent pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. In the S. aureus isolates, 100% were resistant to oxacillin. Overall resistances of A. baumannii and K. pneumonia to imipenem were 70.5% and 76.7%, respectively. A multiple drug resistance phenotype was detected in 68.15% of the isolates. The DA-HAI rates in Iran were shown to be higher than the CDC-NHSN rates and similar to the INICC rates. Resistance to oxacillin and imipenem was higher as well. Comparing device use, DA-HAI rates, and bacterial resistance for the primary isolated bacteria indicated a direct association between urinary catheter use and the rates of CAUTI.
TI  - Immobilization and orientation-dependent activity of a naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide.
AB  - A naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide, SMAP-29, was synthesized with an n-terminal or c-terminal cysteine, termed c_SMAP and SMAP_c, respectively, for site-directed immobilization to superparamagnetic beads. Immobilized SMAP orientation-dependent activity was probed against multiple bacteria of clinical interest including Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus anthracis sterne and Staphylococcus aureus. A kinetic microplate assay was employed to reveal both concentration and time-dependent activity for elucidation of minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and sub-lethal effects. Immobilized SMAP activity was equivalent or reduced compared with soluble SMAP_c and c_SMAP regardless of immobilization orientation, with only one exception. A comparison of immobilized SMAP_c and c_SMAP activity revealed a bacteria-specific potency dependent on immobilization orientation, which was contrary to that seen in solution, wherein SMAP_c was more potent against all bacteria than c_SMAP. Sub-MBC kinetic studies displayed the influence of peptide exposure to the cells with multiple bacteria exhibiting increased susceptibility and efficacy at lower concentrations upon extended exposure (i.e. MBC enhancement). For instances in which complete killing was not achieved, two predominant effects were evident: retardation of growth rate and an increased lag phase. Both effects, seen independently and concomitantly, indicate some degree of induced cellular damage that can serve as a predictor toward eventual cell death. SMAP_c immobilized on glass through standard silanization chemistry was also investigated to ascertain the influence of substrate on activity against select bacteria. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.
TI  - Spread of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  clones in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia in an adult intensive care unit at a university hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Brazil, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates are associated with significant mortality, morbidity and costs. Studies on the clonal relatedness of these isolates could lay the foundation for effective infection prevention and control programs. OBJECTIVES: We sought to study the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of A. baumannii vs. P. aeruginosa VAP in an adult intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: It was conducted a cohort study of patients with VAP caused by carbapenem resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa during 14 months in an adult ICU. Genomic studies were used to investigate the clonal relatedness of carbapenem resistant OXA-23-producing A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. The risk factors for acquisition of VAP were also evaluated. Clinical isolates were collected for analysis as were samples from the environment and were typed using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified trauma diagnosed at admission and inappropriate antimicrobial therapy as independent variables associated with the development of A. baumannii VAP and hemodialysis as independent variable associated with P. aeruginosa VAP. All carbapenem resistant clinical and environmental isolates of A. baumannii were OXA-23 producers. No MBL-producer P. aeruginosa was detected. Molecular typing revealed a polyclonal pattern; however, clone A (clinical) and H (surface) were the most frequent among isolates of A. baumannii tested, with a greater pattern of resistance than other isolates. In P. aeruginosa the most frequent clone I was multi-sensitive. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the requirement of constant monitoring of these microorganisms in order to control the spread of these clones in the hospital environment.
TI  - Development of two real-time multiplex PCR assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. Patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two multiplex real-time PCR assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. We found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum specimens down to a concentration of 100 CFUs/reaction (8333 CFUs/mL). Furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. The specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. Bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in LRTI. Concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputum specimens, and 90% for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. In conclusion, a quantitative molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of LRTI has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission than current standard methods. This should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.
TI  - Hydroxy tricyclic 1,5-naphthyridinone oxabicyclooctane-linked novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors as broad-spectrum antibacterial agents-SAR of RHS moiety (Part-3).
AB  - Novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors (NBTIs) are a new class of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents targeting bacterial Gyrase A and ParC and have potential utility in combating antibiotic resistance. (R)-Hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridinone left-hand side (LHS) oxabicyclooctane linked pyridoxazinone right-hand side (RHS) containing NBTIs showed a potent Gram-positive antibacterial profile. SAR around the RHS moiety, including substitutions around pyridooxazinone, pyridodioxane, and phenyl propenoids has been described. A fluoro substituted pyridoxazinone showed an MIC against Staphylococcus aureus of 0.5mug/mL with reduced functional hERG activity (IC50 333muM) and good in vivo efficacy [ED90 12mg/kg, intravenous (iv) and 15mg/kg, oral (p.o.)]. A pyridodioxane-containing NBTI showed a S. aureus MIC of 0.5mug/mL, significantly improved hERG IC50 764muM and strong efficacy of 11mg/kg (iv) and 5 mg/kg (p.o.). A phenyl propenoid series of compounds showed potent antibacterial activity, but also showed potent hERG binding activity. Many of the compounds in the hydroxy-tricyclic series showed strong activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, but reduced activity against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bicyclic heterocycles appeared to be the best RHS moiety for the hydroxy-tricyclic oxabicyclooctane linked NBTIs.
TI  - In Vitro Activity of Aztreonam-Avibactam against a Global Collection of Gram-Negative Pathogens from 2012 and 2013.
AB  - The combination of aztreonam plus avibactam is being developed for use in infections caused by metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains that also produce serine beta-lactamases. The in vitro activities of aztreonam-avibactam and comparator antimicrobials were determined against year 2012 and 2013 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii using the broth microdilution methodology recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). A total of 28,501 unique clinical isolates were obtained from patients in 190 medical centers within 39 countries. MIC90 values of aztreonam and aztreonam-avibactam against all collected isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n = 23,516) were 64 and 0.12 mug/ml, respectively, with 76.2% of the isolates inhibited by </=4 mug/ml of aztreonam (the CLSI breakpoint) and 99.9% of the isolates inhibited by </=4 mug/ml of aztreonam-avibactam using a fixed concentration of 4 mug/ml of avibactam. The MIC90 was 32 mug/ml for both aztreonam and aztreonam-avibactam against P. aeruginosa (n = 3,766). Aztreonam alone or in combination with avibactam had no in vitro activity against isolates of A. baumannii. PCR and sequencing were used to characterize 5,076 isolates for beta-lactamase genes. Aztreonam was not active against most Enterobacteriaceae isolates producing class A or class C enzymes alone or in combination with class B metallo-beta-lactamases. In contrast, >99% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates producing all observed Ambler classes of beta-lactamase enzymes were inhibited by </=4 mug/ml aztreonam in combination with avibactam, including isolates that produced IMP-, VIM-, and NDM-type metallo-beta-lactamases in combination with multiple serine beta-lactamases.
TI  - Bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (APNTP) against  the ESKAPE pathogens.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. The 'ESKAPE' pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) have been highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. The stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. Atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (APNTP) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. This study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed APNTP jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the ESKAPE pathogens. Standard plate counts and the XTT metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of APNTP, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. APNTP exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the ESKAPE pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and complete eradication of ESKAPE pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of A. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. This demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Repurposing Non-antimicrobial Drugs and Clinical Molecules to Treat Bacterial Infections.
AB  - There is a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials to circumvent the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study is to identify non-antibiotic drugs with potent antimicrobial activity, within an applicable clinical range. A library, containing 727 FDA approved drugs and small molecules, was screened against ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobactercloacae). Drugs that showed antimicrobial activity in an applicable clinical range were further tested in vitro and in vivo in an infected mouse model. The initial screening identified 24 non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules active against Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) isolates. Two non-antibiotic drugs showed activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Among the active non-antibiotic drugs, only ebselen (EB) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd), showed bactericidal activity, in an applicable clinical range, against multi-drug-resistant Staphylococcus isolates including MRSA, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA).The minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of clinical isolates of S. aureus were inhibited (MIC90) was found to be 0.25 and 0.0039mg/L for EB and FdUrd, respectively. Treatment with EB orally significantly increased mice survival in a lethal model of septicemic MRSA-infection by (60%) compared to that of control. FdUrd oral and intraperitoneal treatment significantly enhanced mouse survival by 60% and 100%, respectively. These data encourage screening and repurposing of non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
TI  - Evaluation of the Etest method for detecting colistin susceptibility of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative isolates in Vietnam.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of colistin for 241 multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens were determined by the Etest and by the broth microdilution method (BMD). The two methods showed essential agreements of 76% (77/102) for Acinetobacter baumannii, 90% (36/40) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 84% (83/99) for Enterobacteriaceae isolates, with categorical agreements of 100%, 98%, and 100%, respectively. Of the 241 isolates, none showed a very major error and one (0.4%) showed a major error. MICs ranged from 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml for all A. baumannii and most Enterobacteriaceae isolates, and from 1 to 2 mug/ml for most P. aeruginosa isolates. Of the 40 P. aeruginosa isolates, 27 (68%) showed higher colistin MICs by the Etest than by the BMD. In contrast, 77% (78/102) of the A. baumannii and 57% (56/99) of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates showed lower colistin MICs by the Etest than by the BMD. The Etest is a reliable and easy-to-use method to measure colistin MICs of MDR Gram-negative pathogens in clinical laboratories and can be used following validation by microdilution methods.
TI  - Functional categorization of carbapenemase-mediated resistance by a combined genotyping and two-tiered Modified Hodge Test approach.
AB  - The functional relationship between the detection of carbapenemase activity and phenotypic resistance in Gram-negative bacterial pathogens is often ill-defined. To address this issue, we developed a two-tiered Modified Hodge Test approach for carbapenemase detection and typing, in which the use of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 and Escherichia coli as indicator strains conferred two levels of sensitivities to carbapenemases. When applied alongside PCR genotyping tests for existence of known carbapenemase genes in 92 carbapenem resistant clinical isolates, this method is extremely useful in elucidating the relative role by which different enzymes contributed to the prevalent carbapenem-resistance phenotypes. With this study approach, we showed that the proportion of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains whose carbapenem resistance phenotypes could at least be partially attributed to carbapenemase were 34 and 89%, respectively. Our data also facilitates detailed functional categorization of carbapenem resistance phenotypes on the basis of the types and activities of detectable carbapenemase produced by the test organism. For example, six A. baumannii isolates harboring the bla OXA-51/23-like gene without detectable enzymatic activities were identified, suggesting that other resistance mechanisms may be involved. On the other hand, there were seven P. aeruginosa strains which produced carbapenemase phenotype without harboring known carbapenemase genes, inferring the existence of some hitherto unknown resistance determinants. Findings in this work therefore provide a comprehensive view on the cellular basis of carbapenem resistance phenotypes in major Gram-negative bacterial species, paving the way for development of novel strategies to reverse the effects of the major resistance mechanisms concerned.
TI  - E ffl ux pump-mediated drug resistance in Burkholderia.
AB  - Several members of the genus Burkholderia are prominent pathogens. Infections caused by these bacteria are difficult to treat because of significant antibiotic resistance. Virtually all Burkholderia species are also resistant to polymyxin, prohibiting use of drugs like colistin that are available for treatment of infections caused by most other drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Despite clinical significance and antibiotic resistance of Burkholderia species, characterization of e ffl ux pumps lags behind other non-enteric Gram-negative pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although e ffl ux pumps have been described in several Burkholderia species, they have been best studied in Burkholderia cenocepacia and B. pseudomallei. As in other non-enteric Gram-negatives, e ffl ux pumps of the resistance nodulation cell division (RND) family are the clinically most significant e ffl ux systems in these two species. Several e ffl ux pumps were described in B. cenocepacia, which when expressed confer resistance to clinically significant antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines. Three RND pumps have been characterized in B. pseudomallei, two of which confer either intrinsic or acquired resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, trimethoprim, and in some instances trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole. Several strains of the host-adapted B. mallei, a clone of B. pseudomallei, lack AmrAB-OprA, and are therefore aminoglycoside and macrolide susceptible. B. thailandensis is closely related to B. pseudomallei, but non-pathogenic to humans. Its pump repertoire and ensuing drug resistance profile parallels that of B. pseudomallei. An e ffl ux pump in B. vietnamiensis plays a significant role in acquired aminoglycoside resistance. Summarily, e ffl ux pumps are significant players in Burkholderia drug resistance.
TI  - Susceptibility trends and molecular characterization of Gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections in Jordan and Lebanon: SMART 2011-2013.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate phenotypic and genotypic patterns of antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) and intra-abdominal infection (IAI) in medical centres of Jordan and Lebanon. METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli from the SMART study, collected between the years 2011 and 2013, were first identified at local laboratories. These isolates were shipped to a central laboratory where re-identification, susceptibility testing, and molecular characterization were performed using standard methods. RESULTS: Among the 523 UTI-associated isolates, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis were the most frequent (70%, 14%, and 5%, respectively). E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequent species among the 527 IAI-associated isolates (46%, 14%, and 12%, respectively). Incidence rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers among UTI-associated E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis were 43%, 54%, and 4%, respectively. Corresponding rates among IAI-associated isolates were 49%, 56%, and 12%, respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates showed very disturbing low susceptibility patterns. CTX-M-15 was the most prevalent ESBL produced. Seventeen isolates were non-susceptible to carbapenems (estimated prevalence of 1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The alarmingly high rates of ESBL production and emergence of carbapenemases emphasize the urgent need to develop antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and to maintain antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the gram-negative bacteria isolated from septicemia in Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The choice of antimicrobial treatment for septicemia is often empirical and based on the knowledge of local anti-microbial activity patterns of the most common bacteria causing such bloodstream infections. The current study aimed to study the prevalence of bacterial pathogens causing septicemia and their antimicrobial resistant profiles in hospital admitted patients. METHODS: This cross sectional study done at Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran. We examined 168 bacterial strains isolated from 186 clinically diagnosed septicemia cases refereed at Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran. Over a period of twelve months from July 2010 to 2011 July. 11446 blood samples from patients of clinically suggestive septicemia were evaluated. RESULTS: Bacterial strains were isolated from 910 (7.95%) of blood cultures. Gram-negative bacteria identified were Pseudomonas species (20.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.86%), Salmonella spp (1.09%), Acinetobacter naumannii (8.13%), Escherichia coli (4.06%), Klebsiella spp (5.16%). Gram-negative pathogens were more than gram positive in bloodstream infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, USA) guidelines against: amikacin ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxiclav, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoperazone tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin. Resistanc to different antibiotics in the most important isolated bacteria were: 32.1%, 10.8%, 87.8%, 96%, 39.1%, 35.2, 49.4%, 69%, 80.02%, 22%, 59%, 30.1% respectively, for Pseudomonas spp, 32%, 3.7%, 84.2%, 83.2%, 80.1%, 75.4%, 44.8%, 45.2%, 33.3%, 19%, 34.1, 11.5% respectively for Acinetobacter species. DISCUSSION: Resistant to majority of the antimicrobial agents for several pathogens implicated in bloodstream infections, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria, can make complication in treatment of infection cause by them.
TI  - Alkanna tinctoria leaves extracts: a prospective remedy against multidrug resistant human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plants are rich source of chemical compounds that are used to accomplish biological activity. Indigenously crude extracts of plants are widely used as herbal medicine for the treatment of infections by people of different ethnic groups. The present investigation was carried out to evaluate the biological potential of Alkanna tinctoria leaves extract from district Charsadda, Pakistan against multidrug resistant human pathogenic bacteria including Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: Anti-multi-drug resistant bacterial activity of aqueous, chloroform, ethanol and hexane extracts of Alkanna tinctoria leaves were evaluated by well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of different extracts were determined. Moreover qualitative phytochemicals screening of the studied extracts was performed. RESULTS: All four selected bacteria including A. baumannii, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were categorized as multi-drug resistant (MDR) as they were found to be resistant to 13, 10, 19 and 22 antibiotics belonging to different groups respectively. All the four extract showed potential activity against S. aureus as compare to positive control antibiotic (Imipenem). Similarly among the four extracts of Alkanna tinctoria leaves, aqueous extract showed best activity against A. baumannii (10 +/- 03 mm), P. aeruginosa (12 +/- 0.5 mm), and S. aureus (14 +/- 0.5 mm) as compare to Imipenem. The MICs and MBCs results also showed quantitative concentration of plant extracts to inhibit or kill MDR bacteria. When phytochemicals analysis was performed it was observed that aqueous and ethanol extracts showed phytochemicals with large number as well as volume, especially Alkaloides, Flavonoides and Charbohydrates. CONCLUSION: The undertaken study demonstrated that all the four extracts of Alkanna tinctoria leaves exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against MDR isolates. Finding from the current study will be helpful for further elucidation of lead molecules from Alkanna tinctoria leaves for future therapeutic use against MDR pathogens.
TI  - Repurposing Salicylanilide Anthelmintic Drugs to Combat Drug Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the US. Repurposing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. In this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. The FDA approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant S. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): 0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). The two drugs were also effective against another Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecium (MIC 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the Gram-negative species Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter aerogenes. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant S. aureus clinical isolates, with MICs at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. A time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. Interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. Oxyclozanide was non-toxic to HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro MICs but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. These data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.
TI  - Resistance Rates of Intra-Abdominal Isolates from Intensive Care Units and Non-Intensive Care Units in the United States: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends 2010-2012.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterobacteriaceae (3,235 isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (476 isolates), and Acinetobacter baumannii (106 isolates) from inpatient intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) were collected for the 2010-2012 Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) program in the United States. This report evaluates the in vitro activity of several antimicrobial agents recommended for treatment of IAIs and compares profiles of isolates from intensive care units (ICUs) and non-intensive care units (non-ICUs). METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli from hospitalized patients with IAIs were obtained each year from 2010-2012 from hospitals in the United States and tested for susceptibility to 12 antibiotics according to 2012 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: The most active agents against members of the Enterobacteriaceae family from both ICUs and non-ICUs were amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem-cilastatin, whereas the least active agent was ampicillin-sulbactam. Amikacin was the only agent with good activity against P. aeruginosa, whereas none of the agents tested exhibited substantial activity against A. baumannii. Amikacin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and imipenem-cilastatin were significantly less active against Enterobacteriaceae from ICU patients, whereas cefepime and ceftazidime were significantly less active against P. aeruginosa from ICU patients. Intensive care unit isolates were more likely to be multi-drug-resistant than non-ICU isolates, although there was no difference in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production rates between the two patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing resistance trends, in this study amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem-cilastatin were shown to have good in vitro activity against the most frequently isolated gram-negative bacilli from IAIs in ICU and non-ICU settings.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a University hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in State University of Campinas, no data has been published yet. METHODS: The main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. The blood culture records requested from 4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. The samples were processed using the Bact/Alert(R) system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: A total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). There were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). The prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS) (15.87%), Escherichia coli (13.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), Enterobacter sp (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and Candida sp (5.1%). Examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of the S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 80% of the CNS isolates were oxacillin-resistant. For A. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for P. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. When all Gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. For empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.
TI  - Clinical efficacy and safety of colistin treatment in patients with pulmonary infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii: a meta-analysis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of colistin treatment in patients with pulmonary infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The relevant studies were identified through a search of public databases including PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to December 2012. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the clinical response, mortality and renal damage of colistin (colistin group) versus other effective antibiotics (control group). The odds ratio (OR) was chosen as the effect size. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies were eventually identified. The result of the meta-analysis showed that the pooled OR of clinical response was 1.24 (95% CI = 0.68-2.27, p > 0.05) for patients in the colistin group versus the control group, indicating no significant difference in efficacy between colistin and control groups. Similar results were obtained by the further subgroup meta-analyses by sample size, research year, ethnicity and study method. Treatment with colistin versus other agents did not affect hospital mortality (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.58-1.89, p > 0.05) or renal damage (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.78-2.00, p > 0.05). The combined estimate of our analysis was strong across multiple sensitivity analyses and without significant publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that colistin may be as efficacious and safe as standard antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary infection.
TI  - Emerging broad-spectrum resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii: Mechanisms and epidemiology.
AB  - Multidrug resistance is quite common among non-fermenting Gram-negative rods, in  particular among clinically relevant species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. These bacterial species, which are mainly nosocomial pathogens, possess a diversity of resistance mechanisms that may lead to multidrug or even pandrug resistance. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) conferring resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenemases conferring resistance to carbapenems, and 16S rRNA methylases conferring resistance to all clinically relevant aminoglycosides are the most important causes of concern. Concomitant resistance to fluoroquinolones, polymyxins (colistin) and tigecycline may lead to pandrug resistance. The most important mechanisms of resistance in P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii and their most recent dissemination worldwide are detailed here.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance surveillance of doripenem in China.
AB  - To investigate the antibacterial resistance to doripenem in China and to understand the distribution trends of resistant bacteria. All the clinical isolates were collected from hospitals and the susceptibility tests were performed using the agar dilution method recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) central laboratory. The susceptibility of the isolates to antimicrobial agents was determined using the CLSI (2014) or European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (2013) guidelines. A total of 4047 pathogenic strains were isolated from 18 tertiary hospitals in 18 cities across China between July 2011 and June 2012. MIC results indicated that the vast majority of Enterobacteriaceae maintained high susceptibility to doripenem, with a lower resistance rate (1.9%) than that observed for other drugs tested. In the case of non-fermenting Gram-negative isolates, the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.2%, which was less than that of imipenem and meropenem, and the Acinetobacter baumannii doripenem resistance rate was 67.4%. Doripenem also showed good in vitro activity against other the bacteria tested. This study suggests that the gradual increase in carbapenem nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae should be monitored carefully alongside the increasing multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii.The Journal of Antibiotics advance online publication, 8 April 2015; doi:10.1038/ja.2015.25.
TI  - Kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. Kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial DNA replication enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic Gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium difficile. We have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. We report the MIC50s, MIC90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. We confirm the Gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (MIC90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the Gram-negative nonfermenter Acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. We also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in Pseudomonas, though it is in Escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.
TI  - Influence of antimicrobial consumption on gram-negative bacteria in inpatients receiving antimicrobial resistance therapy from 2008-2013 at a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irrational use of antimicrobial agents is a major cause of increased  antimicrobial resistance. Effective antibiotic stewardship strategies nationwide or in local health care settings are necessary to reduce antibiotic use and bacteria resistance. METHODS: We evaluated the effectiveness of China's antimicrobial stewardship policy on antimicrobial use and applied time-series analysis methodology to determine the temporal relationship between antibiotic use and gram-negative bacteria resistance at Changhai Hospital from 2008-2013. Isolates investigated included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: Consumption of 7 restricted-use antibiotics was dramatically reduced. Resistance to ceftazidime in P aeruginosa and A baumannii and resistance to ciprofloxacin in P aeruginosa significantly decreased. By using cross-correlation analysis, associations between ciprofloxacin resistance in P aeruginosa and fluoroquinolones consumption (r = 0.48; lag = 0; P = .02), ceftazidime resistance in P aeruginosa and third-generation cephalosporins consumption (r = 0.54; lag = -1; P = .01) were identified. No substantial association between other pairs was found. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced nationwide antimicrobial stewardship campaigns launched in 2011 have made great achievements in regard to antibiotic use but have had limited effects on the reversal of gram-negative bacteria resistance in health care settings. Sound infection prevention and control programs to reduce the transmission of resistant pathogens for hospitals in China are urgently needed.
TI  - The Challenge of Antimicrobial Resistance in Managing Intra-Abdominal Infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a worldwide increase in infections caused by microorganisms resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. METHODS: In the past few decades, an increased prevalence of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including Enterococcus spp., carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and resistant Candida spp., also has been observed among intra-abdominal infections (IAIs). RESULTS: The increasing prevalence of multi-drug resistance is responsible for a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality rates associated with IAIs. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary for every surgeon treating IAIs to understand the underlying epidemiology and clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance. Emergence of drug resistance, combined with the lack of new agents in the drug development pipeline, indicates that judicious antimicrobial management will be necessary to preserve the utility of the drugs available currently.
TI  - Reduction in the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in New York City.
AB  - We compared susceptibilities of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected during surveillance studies conducted during 2009 and 2013-2014 involving hospitals in New York City. There were significant decreases in the number of carbapenem-resistant A baumannii and P aeruginosa cases during 2013-2014; it appears the institution of effective infection control measures has contributed to this decline. However the number of isolates of A baumannii with OXA-23-type beta-lactamase increased during 2013-2014.
TI  - [Bacteriological aspects of catheter cultures: study over 24 months].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Catheter-related infections are the sixth leading cause of nosocomial infections with approximately 7% of cases. AIM: The aim of this work was to establish the bacterial epidemiology of the catheter and TIC culture (totally implantable catheter) at the Mohamed V Military Teaching Hospital (MVHMI), and to study the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated. METHODS: this is a retrospective study over 24 months, including the venous and arterial catheters as well as the TIC treated at the Microbiology laboratory of the MVHMI. The culture was realized by the quantitative Brun Buisson method. The antibiotic susceptibility was made according to the French Society guidelines. RESULTS: We have collected 282 cases with 255 catheters and 27 TIC. The significant rate culture was 51,42% (n=145) for catheters and TIC, including 90,43% catheters and 9,57% TIC. These catheters and TIC with positive culture emanated primarily from hemodialysis (32,41%) and surgical intensive care unit (28,97%) services. The microorganisms distribution by species showed the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus (15,91%) followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (14,77%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7,39%). The meticilline resistance rate in Staphylococcus aureus was 7,14%. The Acinetobacter baumannii resistance rate was 64%, and 80,8% for imipenem and ceftazidime respectively. The rate of resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to imipenem and ceftazidime was 69.23% for each. CONCLUSION: The bacterial epidemiology of the catheters and TIC cultures is dominated by the potentially nosocomial bacteria. Multidrug resistance of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa requires an improved catheters management and strengthening nosocomial infections prevention.
TI  - N-Acetylcysteine Selectively Antagonizes the Activity of Imipenem in Pseudomonas  aeruginosa by an OprD-Mediated Mechanism.
AB  - The modulating effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the activity of different antibiotics has been studied in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results demonstrate that, in contrast to previous reports, only the activity of imipenem is clearly affected by NAC. MIC and checkerboard determinations indicate that the NAC-based modulation of imipenem activity is dependent mainly on OprD. SDS-PAGE of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) after NAC treatments demonstrates that NAC does not modify the expression of OprD, suggesting that NAC competitively inhibits the uptake of imipenem through OprD. Similar effects on imipenem activity were obtained with P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. Our results indicate that imipenem-susceptible P. aeruginosa strains become resistant upon simultaneous treatment with NAC and imipenem. Moreover, the generality of the observed effects of NAC on antibiotic activity was assessed with two additional bacterial species, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. Caution should be taken during treatments, as the activity of imipenem may be modified by physiologically attainable concentrations of NAC, particularly during intravenous and nebulized regimes.
TI  - Arbekacin Activity against Contemporary Clinical Bacteria Isolated from Patients  Hospitalized with Pneumonia.
AB  - Arbekacin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside licensed for systemic use in Japan and under clinical development as an inhalation solution in the United States. We evaluated the occurrence of organisms isolated from pneumonias in U.S. hospitalized patients (PHP), including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the in vitro activity of arbekacin. Organism frequency was evaluated from a collection of 2,203 bacterial isolates (339 from VAP) consecutively collected from 25 medical centers in 2012 through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Arbekacin activity was tested against 904 isolates from PHP collected in 2012 from 62 U.S. medical centers and 303 multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms collected worldwide in 2009 and 2010 from various infection types. Susceptibility to arbekacin and comparator agents was evaluated by the reference broth microdilution method. The four most common organisms from PHP were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. The highest arbekacin MIC among S. aureus isolates from PHP (43% methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) was 4 mug/ml. Among P. aeruginosa isolates from PHP, only one had an arbekacin MIC of >16 mug/ml (MIC50 and MIC90, 1 and 4 mug/ml), and susceptibility rates for gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin were 88.0, 90.0, and 98.0%, respectively. Arbekacin (MIC50, 2 mug/ml) and tobramycin (MIC50, 4 mug/ml) were the most potent aminoglycosides tested against Acinetobacter baumannii. Against Enterobacteriaceae from PHP, arbekacin and gentamicin (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 to 1 and 1 to 8 mug/ml for both compounds) were generally more potent than tobramycin (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 to 2 and 1 to 32 mug/ml) and amikacin (MIC50 and MIC90, 1 to 2 and 2 to 32 mug/ml). Arbekacin also demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a worldwide collection of well-characterized MDR Gram-negative and MRSA strains.
TI  - Non-aqueous glycerol monolaurate gel exhibits antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin and surgical infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii are causes of patient morbidity and increased healthcare costs. These organisms grow planktonically and as biofilms, and many strains exhibit antibiotic resistance. This study examines the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of glycerol monolaurate (GML), as solubilized in a non-aqueous vehicle (5% GML Gel), as a novel, broadly-active topical antimicrobial. The FDA has designated GML as generally recognized as safe for human use, and the compound is commonly used in the cosmetic and food industries. METHODS: In vitro, bacterial strains in broths and biofilms were exposed to GML Gel, and effects on bacterial colony-forming units (CFUs) were assessed. In vivo,subcutaneous incisions were made in New Zealand white rabbits; the incisions were closed with four sutures. Bacterial strains were painted onto the incision sites, and then GML Gel or placebo was liberally applied to cover the sites completely. Rabbits were allowed to awaken and were examined for CFUs as a function of exposure time. RESULTS: In vitro, GML Gel was bactericidal for all broth culture and biofilm organisms in <1 hour and <4 hour, respectively; no CFUs were detected after the entire 24 h test period. In vivo, GML Gel inhibited bacterial growth in the surgical incision sites, compared to no growth inhibition in controls. GML Gel significantly reduced inflammation, as viewed by lack of redness in and below the incision sites. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that 5% GML Gel is useful as a potent topical antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agent for prevention of infections.
TI  - The carbapenem inactivation method (CIM), a simple and low-cost alternative for the Carba NP test to assess phenotypic carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods.
AB  - A new phenotypic test, called the Carbapenem Inactivation Method (CIM), was developed to detect carbapenemase activity in Gram-negative rods within eight hours. This method showed high concordance with results obtained by PCR to detect genes coding for the carbapenemases KPC, NDM, OXA-48, VIM, IMP and OXA-23. It allows reliable detection of carbapenemase activity encoded by various genes in species of Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae), but also in non-fermenters Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The CIM was shown to be a cost-effective and highly robust phenotypic screening method that can reliably detect carbapenemase activity.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia monitoring according to the INICC project at one  centre.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a common complication of hospitalisation in severely ill patients who need mechanical ventilation. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium programme for the surveillance of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: A prospective study (1 Jan 2012-30 June 2014) was conducted in the 20-bed ICU. The device utilisation ratios for lung ventilation and the frequency (density and incidence) and aetiology of VAP were estimated in ICU patients. RESULTS: From a total of 1097 patients, VAP infections were diagnosed in 93. Thirty percent of patients with VAP died. The incidence index was 8.47 per 100 admissions to the ICU. VAP infections accounted for 46% of the overall count of device-associated healthcare-associated infections. Mechanical ventilation was used in 71 +/- 8 patients during the 11 862 patient days and 8425 ventilation days. The rate of VAP per 1000 ventilator days was 11.15/9.34 /10.23 in years 2012/2013/2014 (half a year), respectively. The main VAP pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii (45%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%). CONCLUSION: During the reported time span, the incidence of VAP was lower than in the INICC report (2007-2012), but it was tenfold higher than in the NHSN/CDC report (dated 2012). Because of the unchanged VAP level during the 2.5-year observation period, the root cause needs to be determined and action should be taken to resolve this issue.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against European Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Recent clinical isolates of key Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four European countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/L avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. Against Enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. MIC90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90% of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. A two-fold reduction in the MIC90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/L was noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam, whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the MIC values of the test compounds when tested against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Haemophilus influenzae. It had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. This study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa but not against A. baumannii.
TI  - Characterization of a potential beta-lactamase inhibitory metabolite from a marine Streptomyces sp. PM49 active against multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  - Actinobacteria is a prolific producer of complex natural products; we isolated a  potential marine Streptomyces sp. PM49 strain from Bay of Bengal coastal area of India. The strain PM49 exhibited highly efficient antibacterial properties on multidrug-resistant pathogens with a zone of inhibition of 14-17 mm. SSF was adopted for the production of the secondary metabolites from PM49 with ISP2; utilizing agricultural wastes for compound extraction was also attempted. Bioactive fraction of Rf value 0.69 resolved using chloroform and ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) was obtained and subjected to further analysis. Based on UV, IR, ESI-MS, and (1)H and (13)C NMR spectral analysis, it was revealed that the compound is closely similar to cyslabdan with a molecular mass of 467.66 corresponding to the molecular formula C25H41NO5S. ESBL and MBL production was screened in the hospital test isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. PCR amplification in the phenotypically positive strains was positive for bla IMP, bla SHV, bla CTX-M, and mec genes. The beta-lactamase enzyme from tested strains had cephalosporinase activity with a 31-kDa protein and isolated compound from the strain possessing beta-lactamase inhibitory potential. MIC of the active fraction was 16-32 mug/ml on ATCC strains; the ceftazidime and meropenem sensitive and resistant test strains showed MIC of 64-256 mug/ml. The Streptomyces sp. PM49 aerial mycelium was rectiflexibile; the 16S rRNA showed 99 % identity with Streptomyces rochei and submitted at Genbank with accession no JX904061.1.
TI  - Hydrophilic/hydrophobic characters of antimicrobial peptides derived from animals and their effects on multidrug resistant clinical isolates.
AB  - Multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogen infections are serious threats to hospitalized patients because of the limited therapeutic options. A novel group of antibiotic candidates, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), have recently shown powerful activities against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Unfortunately, the viability of using these AMPs in clinical settings remains to be seen, since most still need to be evaluated prior to clinical trials and not all of AMPs are potent against MDR clinical isolates. To find a connection between the characteristics of several of these AMPs and their effects against MDR pathogens, we selected 14 AMPs of animal origin with typical structures and evaluated their in vitro activities against clinical strains of extensive drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. Our results showed that these peptides' hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics, rather than their secondary structures, may explain their antibacterial effects on these clinical isolates. Peptides that are amphipathic along the longitudinal direction seemed to be effective against Gram-negative pathogens, while peptides with hydrophilic terminals separated by a hydrophobic intermediate section appeared to be effective against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Among these, cathelicidin-BF was found to inhibit all of the Gram-negative pathogens tested at dosages of no more than 16 mg/L, killing a pandrug-resistant A. baumannii strain within 2 h at 4xMICs and 4 h at 2xMICs. Tachyplesin III was also found capable of inhibiting all Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens tested at no more than 16 mg/L, and similarly killed the same A. baumannii strain within 4 h at 4xMICs and 2xMICs. These results suggest that both cathelicidin-BF and tachyplesin III are likely viable targets for the development of AMPs for clinical uses.
TI  - Colistin, mechanisms and prevalence of resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections caused by multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, that cause nosocomial infections, represent a growing problem worldwide. The rapid increase in the prevalence of Gram-negative pathogens that are resistant to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides as well as all beta-lactams, including carbapenems, monobactam, cephalosporins and broad-spectrum penicillins, has prompted the reconsideration of colistin as a valid therapeutic option. Colistin is an old class of cationic, which act by disrupting the bacterial membranes resulting in cellular death. Although there has been a significant recent increase in the data gathered on colistin, focusing on its chemistry, antibacterial activity, mechanism of action and resistance, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and new clinical application, the prevalence of colistin resistance has been very little reported in the literature. This review concentrates on recent literature aimed at optimizing the clinical use of this important antibiotic. METHODS: The available evidence from various studies (microbiological and clinical studies, retrieved from the PubMed, and Scopus databases) regarding the mechanisms and prevalence of resistance was evaluated. RESULTS: Increasing use of colistin for treatment of infections caused by these bacteria has led to the emergence of colistin resistance in several countries worldwide. Although resistance to polymyxins is generally less than 10%, it is higher in the Mediterranean and South-East Asia (Korea and Singapore), where colistin resistance rates are continually increasing. CONCLUSION: There is a critical need for effective infection prevention and control measures and strict use of antibiotics in the world to control the rise and spread of colistin resistance.
TI  - Spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  - Ac-GF(A6c)G(A6c)K(A6c)G(A6c)F(A6c)G(A6c)GK(A6c)KKKK-amide (A6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43muM. Spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this AMP interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. CD and 2D-(1)H NMR experiments indicated this AMP on binding to SDS and DPC micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages of helical and random coil conformers. CD investigations in the presence of three phospholipid SUVs consisting of POPC, 4:1 POPC/POPG, and 60% POPE/21%POPG/19%POPC revealed: (1) The interactions occurring with POPC SUVs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the AMP yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) The interactions with 4:1 POPC/POPG, and 60% POPE/21%POPG/19%POPC SUVs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the CD spectra. (3) The presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of SUVs as was the case with micelles. This data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this AMP are very different from the diversity of conformations adopted by this AMP on insertion into the lipid bilayer. CD spectra of this AMP in the presence of SUVs consisting of LPS isolated from P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.
TI  - In vitro activities of 16 antimicrobial agents against Gram-negative bacteria from six teaching hospitals in China.
AB  - To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activities of biapenem, arbekacin, and cefminox against Gram-negative bacteria isolates in China, 100 non-duplicated Escherichia coli, 100 Acinetobacter baumannii, 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, and 99 Klebsiella pneumoniae were collected from six teaching hospitals in China in 2012. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of biapenem, arbekacin, cefminox and 13 other antibiotics were determined by the broth microdilution method. The carbapenems exhibited high antimicrobial activities against E. coli (98%) and K. pneumoniae (more than 95%), followed by colistin and amikacin. The MIC50 and MIC90 of biapenem against E. coli were </=0.06 mg/L and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. For K. pneumoniae, the MIC50 and MIC90 of biapenem were 0.25 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L, respectively. The MIC50 and MIC90 of cefminox against E. coli were 1.0 mg/L and 4.0 mg/L, respectively. The resistance rates of A. baumannii to most of the antibiotics were more than 50%, except for colistin. Amikacin was the most active agent against the P. aeruginosa isolates (97%), followed by colistin (93%). The MIC50 and MIC90 of arbekacin against P. aeruginosa were 2.0 mg/L and 8.0 mg/L, respectively. In conclusion, carbapenems (biapenem, meropenem, and imipenem), colistin, amikacin, and arbekacin exhibited high antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative bacteria, except for A. baumannii.
TI  - Chlorine dioxide is a superior disinfectant against multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) compared with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) on various multidrug-resistant strains in the presence of bovine serum albumin and sheep erythrocytes to mimic the frequent blood contamination in clinical environment. The 3 most important species causing nosocomial infections, i.e., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRA) were evaluated, with 3 representative strains from each. At a 10 ppm-concentration, ClO2 drastically reduced the number of all MDRP and MDRA, and 2 out of 3 MRSA strains, but NaClO was unable to cause any remarkable attenuation for any of the 9 strains tested in 60 seconds. Increased concentration of 100 ppm enabled ClO2 to completely kill MRSA strains, whereas NaClO failed to significantly lower the number of 2 MRSA and 1 MDRA strains. A time-course experiment demonstrated that, within 15 seconds, 100 ppm of ClO2 could kill completely all tested strains but NaClO at this concentration failed to do so. Together, these data suggest that ClO2 is more effective than NaClO against MRSA, MDRP and MDRA, and 100 ppm could be a practical concentration of ClO2 against these multidrug-resistant strains, which may cause fatal nosocomial infections.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia: epidemiology and prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the medical intensive care unit of Chaing Mai University Hospital to describe the epidemiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and identify prognostic indicators of 30-day VAP mortality. A total of 621 patients diagnosed with VAP between January 2005 and December 2011 were included. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 44.4%. The major causative pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii (54.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.2%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (15.1%). Most A. baumannii (90.2%) comprised drug-resistant strains. Identified prognostic indicators were co-morbid malignancy (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-2.42; P = 0.040), septic shock (HR = 2.51; 95% CI, 1.60-4.00; P < 0.001), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II >45 (HR = 1.62; 95% CI, 1.03-2.56; P = 0.041), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >5 (HR = 3.40; 95% CI 2.00-5.81; P < 0.001), and delayed inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (HR = 2.23; 95% CI, 1.12-4.45; P = 0.022). VAP was associated with high mortality. The major causative pathogen was drug-resistant A. baumannii. Therefore, early detection of VAP by surveillance in mechanically ventilated patients leading to earlier treatment may improve patient outcomes. Guidelines for prescribing appropriate empirical antibiotics to cover drug-resistant bacteria could be established using local epidemiological data.
TI  - [Update on outbreaks reported from neonatal intensive care units: Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - In terms of the unique risk profile, the clinical course of nosocomial infections, and the most prevalent bacterial pathogens, literature on outbreaks of potentially pathogenic bacteria on neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) needs to be analyzed separately from reports derived from other intensive care units. With the purpose of updating important information for those involved in outbreak management and fostering preventive efforts, this article summarizes the results of a systematic literature analysis, referring to an earlier publication by Gastmeier et al. This review focuses on NICU outbreaks caused by Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: Results from the Surveillance of Multicenter Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (ICUs) in Taiwan are lacking. METHODS: We surveyed the MIC distribution patterns of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) of major teaching hospitals throughout Taiwan in 2007. We also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. MIC breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2014 were applied. RESULTS: Colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates but moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. cloacae. The ceftobiprole MIC90 value was 4 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/mL for P. aeruginosa. The phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the MIC value of ceftobiprole among S. aureus isolates. Interestingly, the proportion of isolates that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among P. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three Enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of ICU pathogens to important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens against infections in the ICU.

TI  - Global assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility among Gram-negative organisms collected from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was designed to monitor  susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents among important pathogens. We report here on susceptibility among Gram-negative pathogens collected globally from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Most Enterobacteriaceae showed high rates of susceptibility (>95%) to amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem); 90.8% of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were susceptible to minocycline, and susceptibility rates were highest in North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific Rim. Amikacin was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (90.4% susceptibility), with susceptibility rates being highest in North America. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were reported for 11.0% of Escherichia coli isolates and 24.2% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates globally, with rates reaching as high as 25.7% in the Middle East and >43% in Africa and Latin America, respectively. Statistically significant (P<0.01) differences in susceptibility rates were noted between pediatric age groups (1 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, or 13 to 17 years of age), globally and in some regions, for all pathogens except Haemophilus influenzae. Significant (P<0.01) differences were reported for all pathogens globally and in most regions, considerably more frequently, when pediatric and adult susceptibility results were compared. Amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems were active in vitro against most Gram-negative pathogens collected from pediatric patients; A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were susceptible to fewer antimicrobial agents. Susceptibility rates among isolates from pediatric patients were frequently different from those among isolates collected from adults.
TI  - In vitro activity of RX-P873 against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - RX-P873 is a novel antibiotic from the pyrrolocytosine series which exhibits high binding affinity for the bacterial ribosome and broad-spectrum antibiotic properties. The pyrrolocytosines have shown in vitro activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains of bacteria known to cause complicated urinary tract, skin, and lung infections, as well as sepsis. Enterobacteriaceae (657), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (200), and Acinetobacter baumannii (202) isolates from North America and Europe collected in 2012 as part of a worldwide surveillance program were tested in vitro by broth microdilution using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) methodology. RX-P873 (MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) was >32-fold more active than ceftazidime and inhibited 97.1% and 99.5% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates at MIC values of </=1 and </=4 mug/ml, respectively. There were only three isolates with an MIC value of >4 mug/ml (all were indole-positive Protea). RX-P873 (MIC50/90, 2/4 mug/ml) was highly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, including isolates which were nonsusceptible to ceftazidime or meropenem. RX-P873 was 2-fold less active against P. aeruginosa than tobramycin (MIC90, 2 mug/ml; 91.0% susceptible) and colistin (MIC90, 2 mug/ml; 99.5% susceptible) and 2-fold more potent than amikacin (MIC90, 8 mug/ml; 93.5% susceptible) and meropenem (MIC90, 8 mug/ml; 76.0% susceptible). RX-P873, the most active agent against Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC90, 1 mug/ml), was 2-fold more active than colistin (MIC90, 2 mug/ml; 97.0% susceptible) and 4-fold more active than tigecycline (MIC90, 4 mug/ml). This novel agent merits further exploration of its potential against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - MALDI-TOF MS detection of carbapenemase activity in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii compared against the Carba-NP assay.
AB  - MALDI-TOF MS detection of carbapenemase-activity in Gram-negative bacteria was compared against the Carba-NP assay. MALDI-TOF MS detected activity from 99% of the strains, from all types of carbapenemase (200/202), while Carba-NP assays detected activity from 85% (45/53) of the tested isolates and could not consistently identify OXA- or GES carbapenemase activity.
TI  - Efficiency of hydrogen peroxide in improving disinfection of ICU rooms.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The primary objective of this study was to determine the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) techniques in disinfection of ICU rooms contaminated with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) after patient discharge. Secondary objectives included comparison of the efficiency of a vaporizator (HPV, Bioquell(R)) and an aerosolizer using H2O2, and peracetic acid (aHPP, Anios(R)) in MDRO environmental disinfection, and assessment of toxicity of these techniques. METHODS: This prospective cross-over study was conducted in five medical and surgical ICUs located in one University hospital, during a 12-week period. Routine terminal cleaning was followed by H2O2 disinfection. A total of 24 environmental bacteriological samplings were collected per room, from eight frequently touched surfaces, at three time-points: after patient discharge (T0), after terminal cleaning (T1) and after H2O2 disinfection (T2). RESULTS: In total 182 rooms were studied, including 89 (49%) disinfected with aHPP and 93 (51%) with HPV. At T0, 15/182 (8%) rooms were contaminated with at least 1 MDRO (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli 50%, imipenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii 29%, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 17%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime or imipenem 4%). Routine terminal cleaning reduced environmental bacterial load (P <0.001) without efficiency on MDRO (15/182 (8%) rooms at T0 versus 11/182 (6%) at T1; P = 0.371). H2O2 technologies were efficient for environmental MDRO decontamination (6% of rooms contaminated with MDRO at T1 versus 0.5% at T2, P = 0.004). Patient characteristics were similar in aHPP and HPV groups. No significant difference was found between aHPP and HPV regarding the rate of rooms contaminated with MDRO at T2 (P = 0.313). 42% of room occupants were MDRO carriers. The highest rate of rooms contaminated with MDRO was found in rooms where patients stayed for a longer period of time, and where a patient with MDRO was hospitalized. The residual concentration of H2O2 appears to be higher using aHPP, compared with HPV. CONCLUSIONS: H2O2 treatment is efficient in reducing MDRO contaminated rooms in the ICU. No significant difference was found between aHPP and HPV regarding their disinfection efficiency.
TI  - Bloodstream infections among carriers of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae: etiology, incidence and predictors.
AB  - Carriers of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) are increasingly recognised through active surveillance in much of the world. We studied incidence, aetiology and predictors of bloodstream infections (BSI) among such carriers. Via a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital, we examined occurrence of BSI within 45 days of CRKP carrier detection. Three nested case-control studies were conducted to analyse parameters associated with all-cause (ALL), Gram-negative rod (GNR) and CRKP BSI. Cases and controls were compared with respect to demographics, clinical parameters and recent receipt of antibiotics. A total of 431 patients were identified as CRKP carriers (28% by clinical culture, 72% by rectal surveillance), mean age was 75.2 years. Twenty percent of the patients (n = 85) developed BSI, of them 80% (n = 68) with GNR. Of 83 GNR isolates, 58 (70%) were Enterobacteriaceae, of which 19 were CRKP and 20 were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers (23% and 24% of total GNR, respectively); 29% of the GNR isolates were nonfermenters (14.5% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14.5% Acinetobacter baumannii). Mechanical ventilation predicted ALL BSI (p = 0.04), whereas Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea predicted GNR BSI (p = 0.04). Receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem) was significantly associated with ALL BSI or GNR BSI. No exposure independently predicted CRKP BSI. We conclude that patients detected as CRKP carriers are at high risk for BSI within 45 days of detection, primarily with multidrug-resistant GNR. Lack of predictive factors differentiating between pathogens and associated high mortality raises once more the dilemma regarding the appropriate empiric therapy for CRKP carriers who develop severe sepsis.
TI  - Snapshot on carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in Bucharest hospitals reveals unusual clones and novel genetic surroundings for blaOXA-23.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to provide a snapshot on carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=11) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n=7) isolates in hospitalized patients (November 2011, January-March 2012) from two main hospitals in Bucharest, south Romania. METHODS: Clonality among isolates was established by PFGE, MLST and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Carbapenemases were screened by the Blue-Carba test, PCR and sequencing. Transferability of blaOXA-23 was tested by conjugation and plasmid typing (number, size and identity) was assessed by S1-PFGE, replicon typing, hybridization and PCR mapping. RESULTS: All P. aeruginosa isolates carried chromosomally located blaVIM-2, associated with a common class 1 integron (aacA7-blaVIM-2) or an atypical configuration (aacA7-blaVIM-2-dfrB5-tniC). These isolates belonged to unusual lineages; mostly ST233 disseminated in one hospital unit, with ST364 and ST1074 also being detected. A. baumannii isolates carried blaOXA-23 in Tn2008, which was found truncating a TnaphA6 transposon located in a common 60 kb GR6 (aci6) pABKp1-like conjugative plasmid in highly related CC92 clones (ST437, ST764 and ST765), where CC stands for clonal complex. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the spread of VIM-2-producing P. aeruginosa and OXA-23-producing A. baumannii clinical isolates in two hospitals from Bucharest and highlight a peculiar population structure in this Eastern European country. Also, we demonstrate the dissemination of a common and conjugative aci6 pABKp1-like plasmid scaffold in different A. baumannii clones and we report the first known identification of Tnaph6-carrying pACICU2-like plasmids in Europe.
TI  - Mutant prevention concentrations of imipenem and meropenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of the MPC of carbapenems against clinical isolates of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. and to assess its possible relationship with mechanisms of resistance. Detection of the mechanisms of resistance was performed using Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing, Double Disk Synergy, disk antagonism, addition of NaCl to the medium, addition of PBA or EDTA to Carbapenem disks, addition of PBA to Cefoxitin disks, and CCCP test for 10 Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii strains. The MIC and MPC were determined using the broth macrodilution and plate dilution methods, respectively. Four Acinetobacter baumannii strains produced MBL. Two of them produced Oxacillinase and one produced ESBL. Two Pseudomonas spp. isolates produced both KPC and MBL. The resistant Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. strains had higher MPC values than susceptible ones. However, the Mutant Selection Window was found to be dependent on the degree of resistance but not on a particular mechanism of resistance. The usefulness of the MPC was found to be dependent on its value. Based on our data, we recommend determining the MPC for each isolate before using it during treatment. Furthermore, the use of T>MSW instead of T>MIC is suggested.
TI  - The ongoing revolution of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for microbiology reaches tropical Africa.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) represents a revolution in routine pathogen identification in clinical microbiology laboratories. A MALDI-TOF MS was introduced to tropical Africa in the clinical microbiology laboratory of the Hopital Principal de Dakar (Senegal) and used for routine pathogen identification. Using MS, 2,429 bacteria and fungi isolated from patients were directly assayed, leading to the identification of 2,082 bacteria (85.7%) and 206 fungi (8.5%) at the species level, 109 bacteria (4.5%) at the genus level, and 16 bacteria (0.75%) at the family level. Sixteen isolates remained unidentified (0.75%). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent species (25.8%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (6.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (6.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.9%). MALDI-TOF MS has also enabled the detection of rare bacteria and fungi. MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful tool for the identification of bacterial and fungal species involved in infectious diseases in tropical Africa.
TI  - Current epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance data for bacterial bloodstream  infections in patients with hematologic malignancies: an Italian multicentre prospective survey.
AB  - A prospective cohort study was conducted in nine hematology wards at tertiary care centres or at university hospitals located throughout Italy from January 2009 to December 2012. All of the cases of bacterial bloodstream infection (BBSI) occurring in adult patients with hematologic malignancies were included. A total of 668 bacterial isolates were recovered in 575 BBSI episodes. Overall, the susceptibility rates of Gram-negative bacteria were 59.1% to ceftazidime, 20.1% to ciprofloxacin, 79.1% to meropenem, 85.2% to amikacin, 69.2% to gentamicin and 69.8% to piperacillin/tazobactam. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was found in 98/265 (36.9%) of Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Among Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 15/43 (34.9%) were resistant to carbapenems. Of 66 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 46 (69.7%) were multidrug resistant. Overall, the susceptibility rates of Gram-positive bacteria were 97.4% to vancomycin and 94.2% to teicoplanin. Among the monomicrobial cases of BBSI, the 21-day mortality rate was significantly higher for those caused by Gram-negative bacteria compared to those caused by Gram-positive bacteria (47/278, 16.9% vs. 12/212, 5.6%; p < 0.001). Among Gram-negative bacteria, the mortality rate was significantly higher for BBSI caused by K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Our results confirm the recently reported shift of prevalence from Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria as causative agents of BBSIs among patients with hematologic malignancies and highlight a worrisome increasing frequency in antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Emergence of Carbapenem-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii Clinical Isolates Collected from Some Libyan Hospitals.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates recovered from Libyan hospitals between April 2013 and April 2014. In total, 49 strains (24 P. aeruginosa and 25 A. baumannii) were isolated, including 21 P. aeruginosa and 22 A. baumannii isolates (87.75%) resistant to imipenem (minimum inhibitory concentrations >/=16 mug/ml). The blaVIM-2 gene was detected in 19 P. aeruginosa isolates. All imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates showed the presence of OprD mutations. Acquired OXA-carbapenemase-encoding genes were present in all A. baumannii isolates: blaOXA-23 (n=19) and blaOXA-24 (n=3). Finally, a total of 13 and 17 different sequence types were assigned to the 21 P. aeruginosa and the 22 A. baumannii carbapenem-resistant isolates, respectively. This study is the first report describing imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolated from patients in Libya. We report the first case of co-occurrence of blaVIM-2 with oprD porin loss in identical isolates of P. aeruginosa in Libya and demonstrate that these oprD mutations can be used as a tool to study the clonality in P. aeruginosa isolates. We also report the first identification of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolates harboring blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-24-like, and blaOXA-48-like genes in Libya.
TI  - Outer-inner membrane vesicles naturally secreted by gram-negative pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Outer-inner membrane vesicles (O-IMVs) were recently described as a new type of membrane vesicle secreted by the Antarctic bacterium Shewanella vesiculosa M7T. Their formation is characterized by the protrusion of both outer and plasma membranes, which pulls cytoplasmic components into the vesicles. To demonstrate that this is not a singular phenomenon in a bacterium occurring in an extreme environment, the identification of O-IMVs in pathogenic bacteria was undertaken. With this aim, a structural study by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) was carried out, confirming that O-IMVs are also secreted by Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Acinetobacter baumannii AB41, in which they represent between 0.23% and 1.2% of total vesicles produced. DNA and ATP, which are components solely found in the cell cytoplasm, were identified within membrane vesicles of these strains. The presence of DNA inside the O-IMVs produced by N. gonorrhoeae was confirmed by gold DNA immunolabeling with a specific monoclonal IgM against double-stranded DNA. A proteomic analysis of N. gonorrhoeae-derived membrane vesicles identified proteins from the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. This confirmation of O-IMV extends the hitherto uniform definition of membrane vesicles in Gram-negative bacteria and explains the presence of components in membrane vesicles such as DNA, cytoplasmic and inner membrane proteins, as well as ATP, detected for the first time. The production of these O-IMVs by pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria opens up new areas of study related to their involvement in lateral gene transfer, the transfer of cytoplasmic proteins, as well as the functionality and role of ATP detected in these new vesicles.
TI  - Impact of pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia in trauma patients on charges and recurrence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) represents one of the driving forces behind antibiotic use in the ICU. In a previous study, we established a defined algorithm for treatment of hospital-acquired VAP dictated by the causative pathogen. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the impact of this algorithm for hospital-acquired VAP on recurrence and charges in trauma patients. STUDY DESIGN: Patients with VAP secondary to MRSA, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, or Enterobacteriaceae during 5 years subsequent to the previous study were evaluated. All VAP were diagnosed using quantitative cultures of the bronchoalveolar lavage effluent. Duration of antimicrobial therapy was dictated by the causative pathogen. If microbiologic resolution, defined as <10(3) colony-forming units/mL, was achieved, therapy was stopped by day 10. The remainder received 14 days of therapy. Recurrence was defined as >10(5) colony-forming units/mL on subsequent bronchoalveolar lavage performed within 2 weeks after completion of appropriate therapy. RESULTS: Five hundred and twenty-nine VAP episodes were identified in 381 patients. Overall recurrence was unchanged compared with the previous study (1.5% vs 2%; p = 0.3). There was a decrease in the number of bronchoalveolar lavages performed per patient compared with the previous study (1.6 vs 2.3; p = 0.24) and a reduction of 4.8 antibiotic days per VAP episode compared with the previous study. Both changes resulted in a cumulative reduction of $3,535.04 per patient, for a savings of $1.35 million during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-acquired VAP can be managed effectively by a defined course of therapy dictated by the causative pathogen. Adherence to an established algorithm simplified the management of VAP and contributed to a cumulative reduction in patient charges without impacting recurrence.
TI  - Molecular characterization of carbapenemase production among gram-negative bacteria in saudi arabia.
AB  - We characterized the molecular basis of carbapenemase production in carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients from Saudi Arabia in the year 2012. Isolates were collected from across the Kingdom and phenotypically tested for carbapenemase production. Polymerase chain reaction detection of carbapenemase genes was also performed. Our results indicate that in Saudi Arabia, OXA-48 and NDM-1 are the dominant carbapenemases among Enterobacteriaceae with low prevalence of VIM. The latter is the most prevalent metallo-beta-lactamase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas oxacillinases, OXA-23 in particular, are the dominant carbapenemases in Acinetobacter baumannii. No KPC or IMP genes were detected. Our study is the first report of OXA-48, NDM-1, and VIM-4 enzymes in Enterobacter from the Kingdom. Also it is the first report of OXA-72 and NDM-1 in A. baumannii in Saudi Arabia, and the coexistence of blaOXA-23 and blaNDM-1 genes in this species in the country. Awareness of the role of international travel in the spread of carbapenem-resistant determinants in the Kingdom, as well as effective infection control interventions in hospitals and strict antimicrobial stewardship in healthcare facilities and the community are keys to combat the rise of carbapenemase producers in the Kingdom.
TI  - Which Multidrug-Resitant Bacteria are Emerging in Patients with Hematological Malignancies?: One-Year Report.
AB  - The aim of this retrospective, observational study was to evaluate the outcomes of bacteremia attacks during neutropenic episodes caused by chemotherapy in patients with hematological cancers by assessing mortality, involved pathogens, antimicrobial therapy and treatment responses. Patients who were older than 14 years of age and developed at least one neutropenic episode after chemotherapy to treat hematological cancer between November 2011 and November 2012 were included in the study. We retrospectively collected demographic, treatment, and survival data for 68 patients with 129 neutropenic episodes. The mean age was 59.36 +/- 15.22 years (range 17-80 years), and 41 cases were male. The mean Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer score was 19.56 +/- 9.04. A total of 37 (28 %) bacteremia attacks were recorded in 20 cases (29 %). Fatality rates were 50 % in the six cases with bacteremia caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria; death occurred in two patients with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and in one patient with carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clinical and microbiological responses were achieved using PIP-TAZ or CEP-SUL treatment in 80 % (16/20) of the cases with bacteremia caused by carbapenem-sensitive Gram-negative bacteria (CS-GNB). During 547 colonization-days in 21 (30 %) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)-colonized cases among 68 patients, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bacteremia developed in two patients. Non-carbapenem-based therapy can cure most bacteremia attacks caused by CS-GNB in patients with hematological cancer. However, bacteremia and other infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens, such as A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and VRE, are a growing concern in hematological patients.

TI  - Gram-negative infections in adult intensive care units of latin america and the Caribbean.
AB  - This review summarizes recent epidemiology of Gram-negative infections in selected countries from Latin American and Caribbean adult intensive care units (ICUs). A systematic search of the biomedical literature (PubMed) was performed to identify articles published over the last decade. Where appropriate, data also were collected from the reference list of published articles, health departments of specific countries, and registries. Independent cohort data from all countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela) signified a high rate of ICU infections (prevalence: Argentina, 24%; Brazil, 57%). Gram-negative pathogens, predominantly Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, accounted for >50% of ICU infections, which were often complicated by the presence of multidrug-resistant strains and clonal outbreaks. Empirical use of antimicrobial agents was identified as a strong risk factor for resistance development and excessive mortality. Infection control strategies utilizing hygiene measures and antimicrobial stewardship programs reduced the rate of device-associated infections. To mitigate the poor health outcomes associated with infections by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, urgent focus must be placed on infection control strategies and local surveillance programs.
TI  - Exploring the epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in west London and the utility of routinely collected hospital microbiology data.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify carbapenem-resistant organisms using routinely collected local microbiology data and describe the epidemiology of carbapenem resistance in two London teaching hospitals. METHODS: Data on inpatients infected or colonized with Gram-negative organisms between March 2009 and February 2012 were extracted. A computer algorithm was developed incorporating internationally recognized criteria to distinguish carbapenem-resistant organisms. Multivariable analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with infection or colonization with carbapenem-resistant organisms. Binomial regression was performed to detect changes in resistance trends over time. RESULTS: Yearly incidence of carbapenem resistance was observed to be increasing, with significant increasing trends in Acinetobacter baumannii (47.1% in 2009-10 to 77.2% in 2011-12; P<0.001) and Enterobacter spp. (2.2% in 2009-10 to 11.5% in 2011-12; P<0.001). Single-variable and multivariable analysis demonstrated differences in the proportion of carbapenem-resistant isolates across all variables investigated, including age, sex and clinical specialty; in the latter organism-specific niches were identified. Patients in the youngest age group (16-24 years old) had the highest odds of being infected or colonized with carbapenem-resistant isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, proportions of carbapenem-resistant organisms differed between the hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenem resistance is an emerging problem within the UK inpatient healthcare setting. This is not an issue confined to the Enterobacteriaceae and fine-resolution surveillance is needed to identify at-risk groups. Regular analysis of routinely collected data can provide insight into the evolving carbapenem-resistance threat, with the ability to inform efforts to prevent the spread of resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts obtained from vegetative organs of A. retroflexus.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Amaranthus retroflexus leaves and inflorescence alcoholic (ethanol 70%) extracts of various concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 400 muL/ml were analyzed on different clinical and reference bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtills, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii) and fungal strains (Candida albicans, C. famata, C. utilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (MIC determination) for antimicrobial activity and TEAC (Trolox capacity) assay for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity. The adapted diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial effect of the extracts separately and in combination with a range of standard antibiotics, in order to evidence any synergic effects of A. retroflexus extracts on the antibiotics activity. The extracts showed the highest inhibitory effect against K. pneumoniae and B. subtilis with no activity against S. aureus among the bacterial strains, while in case of the fungal strains the most intensive effect was exhibited against C. famata by both extracts. The A. retroflexus leaves extract improved the ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid activity towards the P. aeruginosa clinical strain. The inflorescences extract significantly increased chloramphenicol activity on B. subtilis strain. The antioxidant activity assay showed that the studied extracts exhibited the ability to neutralize the free radicals leading to the conclusion that the tested extracts bear compounds with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity that could represent a potential alternative for treating various infectious diseases.
TI  - Mechanisms of polymyxin resistance: acquired and intrinsic resistance in bacteria.
AB  - Polymyxins are polycationic antimicrobial peptides that are currently the last-resort antibiotics for the treatment of multidrug-resistant, Gram-negative bacterial infections. The reintroduction of polymyxins for antimicrobial therapy has been followed by an increase in reports of resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. Some bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii, develop resistance to polymyxins in a process referred to as acquired resistance, whereas other bacteria, such as Proteus spp., Serratia spp., and Burkholderia spp., are naturally resistant to these drugs. Reports of polymyxin resistance in clinical isolates have recently increased, including acquired and intrinsically resistant pathogens. This increase is considered a serious issue, prompting concern due to the low number of currently available effective antibiotics. This review summarizes current knowledge concerning the different strategies bacteria employ to resist the activities of polymyxins. Gram-negative bacteria employ several strategies to protect themselves from polymyxin antibiotics (polymyxin B and colistin), including a variety of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) modifications, such as modifications of lipid A with phosphoethanolamine and 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose, in addition to the use of efflux pumps, the formation of capsules and overexpression of the outer membrane protein OprH, which are all effectively regulated at the molecular level. The increased understanding of these mechanisms is extremely vital and timely to facilitate studies of antimicrobial peptides and find new potential drugs targeting clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Trends in antibiotic resistance in Medellin and municipalities of the Metropolitan Area between 2007 and 2012: Results of six years of surveillance].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in Medellin and its Metropolitan Area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using WHONET 5.6 program. For interpretation of susceptibility results, CLSI standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. Using the Epi-Info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). In Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in Klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and Enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). K. pneumoniae , S. marcescens and E. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii . CONCLUSIONS: The resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of E. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae . It is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
TI  - Risk factors for mortality in liver transplant recipients with ESKAPE infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infections caused by the pathogens Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp (ESKAPE) have recently been identified as serious emerging problems in solid organ transplant, no information in liver transplant (LT) recipients is available. We sought to investigate the risk factors for associated mortality in LT recipients with ESKAPE infections. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of infection after LT was reviewed. Risk factors for mortality caused by ESKAPE infection were identified. RESULTS: Fifty-three episodes of infections caused by ESKAPE were documented in 51 LT recipients. The main sites of infection were the bloodstream (49.0%), the lungs (33.3%), and the intra-abdominal/biliary tract (17.6%). The risk factors for mortality independently associated with ESKAPE infection were female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 6.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-40.8, P = .042), septic shock (OR = 30.1, 95% CI = 3.7-244.8, P = .001), and lymphocyte counts <300/mm(3) (OR = 20.2, 95% CI = 2.9-142.2, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: To improve the results of LT, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when female LT recipients with ESKAPE infection present with septic shock and decreased lymphocyte counts.
TI  - Trends and correlation of antibacterial usage and bacterial resistance: time series analysis for antibacterial stewardship in a Chinese teaching hospital (2009-2013).
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to describe the effect of antibacterial stewardship and evaluate the trends and correlation of antibacterial resistance and usage from 2009 to 2013 in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in northwest China. Antibacterial usage was expressed as defined daily doses per 100 patients per day (DDDs/100 PDs). Hospital-wide population-level data and time series analysis were used to evaluate the trends and determine associations between antibacterial exposure and acquisition of resistance. Yearly consumption of overall antibacterials significantly decreased from 66.54 to 28.08 DDDs/100 PDs (beta = -10.504, p < 0.01). The resistant rates of the five most frequently isolated species (including Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) significantly decreased or remained stable, and none of them showed a statistically significant upward trend. The medical quality indicators got better or remained stable. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models demonstrated that the monthly resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to imipenem was strongly correlated with antipseudomonal carbapenems usage (beta = 34.94, p < 0.001), as did the correlation of P. aeruginosa to meropenem with antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporins usage (beta = 32.76, p < 0.01) and K. pneumoniae to amikacin with aminoglycosides usage (beta = 22.01, p < 0.001). The decreased antibacterial use paralleled the improved bacterial resistance without deteriorating medical quality indicators during antimicrobial stewardship. It also suggests that optimum antibiotic use is necessary to alleviate the threat posed by resistant microorganisms at the hospital level.
TI  - Impact of ertapenem on antimicrobial resistance in a sentinel group of Gram-negative bacilli: a 6 year antimicrobial resistance surveillance study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between ertapenem and resistance of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex to different antimicrobials while adjusting for relevant hospital factors. METHODS: This was a retrospective time-series study conducted at a tertiary care centre from September 2002 to August 2008. The specific impact of ertapenem on the resistance of these Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) was assessed by multiple linear regression analysis, adjusting for the average length of stay, rate of hospital-acquired infections and use of 10 other antimicrobials, including type 2 carbapenems. RESULTS: Unadjusted analyses revealed significant increases over the duration of the study in the number of GNB resistant to meropenem/imipenem among 1000 isolates each of E. coli (0.46 +/- 0.22, P < 0.05), P. aeruginosa (6.26 +/- 2.26, P < 0.05), K. pneumoniae (8.06 +/- 1.50, P < 0.0005) and A. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (25.39 +/- 6.81, P < 0.0005). Increased resistance to cefepime (and other extended-spectrum cephalosporins) was observed in E. coli (9.55 +/- 1.45, P < 0.0005) and K. pneumoniae (15.21 +/- 2.42, P < 0.0005). A. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex showed increased resistance to all antimicrobials except amikacin. After controlling for confounders, ertapenem was not significantly associated (P > 0.05) with changes in resistance for any pathogen/antimicrobial combination. CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for confounders, ertapenem was not associated with changes in resistance in a group of sentinel GNB, although significant variations in resistance to different antimicrobials were observed in the unadjusted analyses. These results emphasize the importance of implementation of local resistance surveillance platforms and stewardship programmes to combat the global emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - A study on the ability of quaternary ammonium groups attached to a polyurethane foam wound dressing to inhibit bacterial attachment and biofilm formation.
AB  - Bacterial infection of acute and chronic wounds impedes wound healing significantly. Part of this impediment is the ability of bacterial pathogens to grow in wound dressings. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of a polyurethane (PU) foam wound dressings coated with poly diallyl-dimethylammonium chloride (pDADMAC-PU) to inhibit the growth and biofilm development by three main wound pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii, within the wound dressing. pDADMAC-PU inhibited the growth of all three pathogens. Time-kill curves were conducted both with and without serum to determine the killing kinetic of pDADMAC-PU. pDADMAC-PU killed S. aureus, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa. The effect of pDADMAC-PU on biofilm development was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitative analysis, colony-forming unit assay, revealed that pDADMAC-PU dressing produced more than eight log reduction in biofilm formation by each pathogen. Visualization of the biofilms by either confocal laser scanning microscopy or scanning electron microscopy confirmed these findings. In addition, it was found that the pDADMAC-PU-treated foam totally inhibited migration of bacteria through the foam for all three bacterial strains. These results suggest that pDADMAC-PU is an effective wound dressing that inhibits the growth of wound pathogens both within the wound and in the wound dressing.
TI  - Fast and effective photodynamic inactivation of multiresistant bacteria by cationic riboflavin derivatives.
AB  - Photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (PIB) proves to be an additional method to  kill pathogenic bacteria. PIB requires photosensitizer molecules that effectively generate reactive oxygen species like singlet oxygen when exposed to visible light. To allow a broad application in medicine, photosensitizers should be safe when applied in humans. Substances like vitamin B2, which are most likely safe, are known to produce singlet oxygen upon irradiation. In the present study, we added positive charges to flavin derivatives to enable attachment of these molecules to the negatively charged surface of bacteria. Two of the synthesized flavin derivatives showed a high quantum yield of singlet oxygen of approximately 75%. Multidrug resistant bacteria like MRSA (Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus), EHEC (enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii were incubated with these flavin derivatives in vitro and were subsequently irradiated with visible light for seconds only. Singlet oxygen production in bacteria was proved by detecting its luminescence at 1270 nm. After irradiation, the number of viable bacteria decreased up to 6 log10 steps depending on the concentration of the flavin derivatives and the light dosimetry. The bactericidal effect of PIB was independent of the bacterial type and the corresponding antibiotic resistance pattern. In contrast, the photosensitizer concentration and light parameters used for bacteria killing did not affect cell viability of human keratinocytes (therapeutic window). Multiresistant bacteria can be safely and effectively killed by a combination of modified vitamin B2 molecules, oxygen and visible light, whereas normal skin cells survive. Further work will include these new photosensitizers for topical application to decolonize bacteria from skin and mucosa.
TI  - Synergistic interactions in mixed-species biofilms of pathogenic bacteria from the respiratory tract.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mixed-species biofilms are involved in a wide variety of infections. We studied the synergistic interactions during dual-species biofilm formation among isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. METHODS: Isolates were cultured as single-species and all possible combinations of dual-species biofilms. RESULTS: The 61 A. baumannii biofilms increased by 26-fold when cultured with S. maltophilia isolates; 62 A. baumannii biofilms increased by 20-fold when cultured with S. maltophilia isolates; and 31 P. aeruginosa biofilms increased by 102-fold when cultured with S. maltophilia 106. CONCLUSIONS: Synergy was observed between two isolates, including those that inherently lacked biofilm formation ability.
TI  - Infection control issues in patients with haematological malignancies in the era  of multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Drug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are now increasingly identified as a cause of infections in immunocompromised hosts. Bacteria identified include the multidrug-resistant (MDR) and even pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae spp. The threat from MDR pathogens has been well-documented in the past decade with warnings about the consequences of inappropriate use of antimicrobial drugs. Resistant bacteria can substantially complicate the treatment of infections in critically ill patients and can have a substantial effect on mortality. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment can affect morbidity, mortality, and overall health-care costs. Evidence-based data for prevention and control of MDR pathogen infections in haematology are scarce. Although not yet established a bundle of infection control and prevention measures with an anti-infective stewardship programme is an important strategy in infection control, diagnosis, and antibiotic selection with optimum regimens to ensure a successful outcome for patients.
TI  - Disease burden of intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia in China: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are associated with poor clinical and economic outcomes. Data regarding ICU-acquired pneumonia and VAP are not readily available from developing countries, including China. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the incidence, mortality rate, length of stay, and pathogens associated with ICU-acquired pneumonia in China. METHODS: A meta-analysis and systematic review of 334 publications published between January 2007 and May 2012 and retrieved from the Chinese BioMedical database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Chinese Science and Technique Journals database, Wanfang database, and PubMed was conducted. RESULTS: The incidences of ICU-acquired pneumonia and VAP were 16.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 12.8-20.4%) and 33.7% (95% CI 31.4-36.1%), respectively; mortality rates were 37.4% (95% CI 24.6-52.2%) and 34.5% (95% CI 29.2-40.1%), respectively. The durations of stay in the ICU and hospital were 12.4 (95% CI 9.6-15.3) and 17.7 (95% CI 15.6-19.7) days and 18.0 (95% CI 16.5-19.6) and 30.5 (95% CI 26.4-34.7) days for ICU-acquired pneumonia and VAP, respectively. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.9%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (13.9%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.9%) and Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%); 82.9% of S. aureus isolates were reported to be methicillin-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: ICU-acquired pneumonia/VAP remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients in the ICU in China. Data on organisms causing disease in this population could help guide appropriate prevention strategies and treatment.

TI  - Wild mushroom extracts as inhibitors of bacterial biofilm formation.
AB  - Microorganisms can colonize a wide variety of medical devices, putting patients in risk for local and systemic infectious complications, including local-site infections, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and endocarditis. These microorganisms are able to grow adhered to almost every surface, forming architecturally complex communities termed biofilms. The use of natural products has been extremely successful in the discovery of new medicine, and mushrooms could be a source of natural antimicrobials. The present study reports the capacity of wild mushroom extracts to inhibit in vitro biofilm formation by multi-resistant bacteria. Four Gram-negative bacteria biofilm producers (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii) isolated from urine were used to verify the activity of Russula delica, Fistulina hepatica, Mycena rosea, Leucopaxilus giganteus, and Lepista nuda extracts. The results obtained showed that all tested mushroom extracts presented some extent of inhibition of biofilm production. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the microorganism with the highest capacity of biofilm production, being also the most susceptible to the extracts inhibition capacity (equal or higher than 50%). Among the five tested extracts against E. coli, Leucopaxillus giganteus (47.8%) and Mycenas rosea (44.8%) presented the highest inhibition of biofilm formation. The extracts exhibiting the highest inhibitory effect upon P. mirabilis biofilm formation were Sarcodon imbricatus (45.4%) and Russula delica (53.1%). Acinetobacter baumannii was the microorganism with the lowest susceptibility to mushroom extracts inhibitory effect on biofilm production (highest inhibition-almost 29%, by Russula delica extract). This is a pioneer study since, as far as we know, there are no reports on the inhibition of biofilm production by the studied mushroom extracts and in particular against multi-resistant clinical isolates; nevertheless, other studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of action.
TI  - A prospective study on bacterial and atypical etiology of acute exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - AIM: The bacterial and atypical etiology of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was investigated and the diagnostic techniques used were compared among 92 hospitalized patients. MATERIALS & METHODS: Sputum specimens were investigated using culture and PCR, serological status evaluation was performed and the inflammatory profile was associated with the microbiological results. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: The majority of the patients (65.2%) had very severe airway obstruction. The most common bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.9 and 14.1%, respectively). Acinetobacter baumannii- and P. aeruginosa-positive cultures were associated with prolonged hospitalization and severe airway obstruction (p = 0.03 and 0.031, respectively). Chlamydia pneumoniae or Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was diagnosed in four and two patients, respectively. Discrepant results were detected between PCR and serology, especially regarding C. pneumoniae.
TI  - A potent antimicrobial compound isolated from Clathria cervicornis.
AB  - The sponge of Clathria cervicornis is commonly used in traditional medicine. This study aims to identify the active compound in C. cervicornis and to evaluate its antimicrobial activity. The purified active compound was determined to be crambescidin 800 and was found to be highly active against Acinetobacter baumannii (minimal inhibitory concentration, MIC=2 mug/ml), Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC=1 mug/ml) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC=1 mug/ml). A potent antimicrobial compound, crambescidin 800, was isolated in Clathria cervicornis. It is extremely active against three common pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - The molecular basis of beta-lactamase production in Gram-negative bacteria from Saudi Arabia.
AB  - Resistance to beta-lactams among Gram-negative bacteria is a worldwide issue. Increased prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producers and the dissemination of carbapenem-resistance genes are particularly concerning. ESBL-producing strains are common in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, particularly among the Enterobacteriaceae, and carbapenem resistance is on the increase, especially among the non-fermenters. beta-lactamase production is a major mechanism of resistance to these agents and although beta-lactamase-producing strains have been documented in the Kingdom, relatively few reports characterized the molecular basis of this production. Nevertheless, available data suggest that CTX-M (CTX-M-15 in particular) is the predominant ESBL in the Enterobacteriaceae, with SHV also being prevalent in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Carbapenem resistance in the latter is mainly due to OXA-48 and NDM-1. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, VEB-like enzymes are the most common ESBLs, and VIM is the prevalent metallo-beta-lactamase. OXA-10 extended-spectrum enzymes are also frequent. PER and GES ESBLs have been reported in Acinetobacter baumannii, and oxacillinases (OXA-23 in particular) are the dominant carbapanamases in this species.
TI  - Active screening of multi-drug resistant bacteria effectively prevent and control the potential infections.
AB  - Our objective is to determine if actively screen the multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDRB) infection in intensive care unit (ICU) to prevent, control, and decrease the infection rate and transmission of MDRB. The patients admitted in ICU of one hospital in 2013 were analyzed. The throat swab, blood, defecation, and urine of patients were actively collected for bacteria cultures to screen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii in patients. All patients received screening of MDRB infection and colonization within 2 days and after 2 days of admission, the results showed that there were 418 infectious bacterial strains in total and P. aeruginosa was the main bacterium. The asymptomatic infection rates of P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia, E. coli, S. aureus, and A. baumannii were 39.02, 24.74, 44.00, 29.17, and 33.33 %, respectively; the symptomatic infection rates were 60.98, 75.26, 56.00, 70.83, and 66.67 %. 59.70 % patients received antibiotics treatment, 27.45 % patients received trachea cannula, 32.95 % patients received mechanism ventilation, 2.27 % patients received arterial cannula or venous cannula and 4.00 % patients received indwelling urinary catheters. The main MDRB in ICU is P. aeruginosa. The active screening of MDRB infection and colonization can provide the opportunity to take the life-saving measure against MDRB and treat patients. This can decrease the infection risk and the nosocomial transmission of MDRB.
TI  - Molecular basis of selective inhibition and slow reversibility of avibactam against class D carbapenemases: a structure-guided study of OXA-24 and OXA-48.
AB  - The Class D (or OXA-type) beta-lactamases have expanded to be the most diverse group of serine beta-lactamases with a highly heterogeneous beta-lactam hydrolysis profile and are typically resistant to marketed beta-lactamase inhibitors. Class D enzymes are increasingly found in multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and various species of the Enterobacteriaceae and are posing a serious threat to the clinical utility of beta-lactams including the carbapenems, which are typically reserved as the drugs of last resort. Avibactam, a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor, not only inhibits all class A and class C beta-lactamases but also has the promise of inhibition of certain OXA enzymes, thus extending the antibacterial activity of the beta-lactam used in combination to the organisms that produce these enzymes. X-ray structures of OXA-24 and OXA-48 in complex with avibactam revealed the binding mode of this inhibitor in this diverse class of enzymes and provides a rationale for selective inhibition of OXA-48 members. Additionally, various subunits of the OXA-48 structure in the asymmetric unit provide snapshots of different states of the inhibited enzyme. Overall, these data provide the first structural evidence of the exceptionally slow reversibility observed with avibactam in class D beta-lactamases. Mechanisms for acylation and deacylation of avibactam by class D enzymes are proposed, and the likely extent of inhibition of class D beta-lactamases by avibactam is discussed.

TI  - Intracranial malignant lesions correlate with the requirement for a long treatment course in postoperative central nervous system infection.
AB  - AIM: Our aim was to study the clinical features of postoperative meningitis after neurosurgery and identify the factors affecting the duration of treatment. METHODS: This retrospective study assessed 283 patients with postoperative bacterial meningitis in the Neurosurgery Department of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China, between January and December 2012. Patients' clinical data were reviewed, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with a prolonged treatment course. RESULTS: The mortality rate was 0.4% in these patients, of whom 12.4% were found with pathogens in the cerebrospinal fluid. Among the three most common pathogens detected were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean treatment course was 13.5+/-2.1 days. Interestingly, the treatment duration for postoperative meningitis was significantly longer in patients with intracranial malignant tumors than in those with benign lesions. Single-factor analysis showed that male sex (P=0.042) and malignant (rather than benign) lesions (P<0.001) were significantly associated with prolonged treatment duration. Multivariate analysis further confirmed that malignant intracranial lesions represented an independent risk factor for prolonged treatment duration (odds ratio: 2.5962; 95% confidence interval: 1.1092-6.6134). CONCLUSION: The nature of the intracranial lesion is an independent risk factor for the duration of treatment in postoperative meningitis after neurosurgery.
TI  - Crystal structure of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase from a Gram-positive bacterium, Streptococcus pyogenes at 2.19 A resolution shows the closed structure of the substrate-binding cleft.
AB  - Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) catalyses the release of tRNA and peptide components from peptidyl-tRNA molecules. Pth from a Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes (SpPth) was cloned, expressed, purified and crystallised. Three-dimensional structure of SpPth was determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.19 A resolution. Structure determination showed that the asymmetric unit of the unit cell contained two crystallographically independent molecules, designated A and B. The superimposition of C(alpha) traces of molecules A and B showed an r.m.s. shift of 0.4 A, indicating that the structures of two crystallographically independent molecules were identical. The polypeptide chain of SpPth adopted an overall alpha/beta conformation. The substrate-binding cleft in SpPth is formed with three loops: the gate loop, Ile91-Leu102; the base loop, Gly108-Gly115; and the lid loop, Gly136-Gly150. Unlike in the structures of Pth from Gram-negative bacteria, the entry to the cleft in the structure of SpPth appeared to be virtually closed. However, the conformations of the active site residues were found to be similar.
TI  - Blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in Warsaw.
AB  - Establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. A total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of two transplantation wards of a large hospital in Warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux, France). The 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. The highest proportion were bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with Escherichia coli (61 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and Enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. The non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), Achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and Acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). Most frequent Gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). Of 77 staphylococcal strains, 56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 Staphylococcus aureus. Other Gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). Obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). Among all Enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (ESBLs). Resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of S aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples, 2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. Both were Enterococcus faecium. Resistant strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.
TI  - Differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections between general wards and RICU.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are common among patients  in hospitals worldwide, especially in patients over the age of 60. This study investigates the differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in LRTIs. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of 4,762 LRTI patients in the general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) of Xiangya Hospital (Changsha) were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The infection rate of Gram-negative bacteria was significantly higher than that of Gram-positive bacteria in both the general ward and RICU (P<0.05). The incidence of Gram-negative bacteria infection was significantly higher in the RICU than in the general ward (P<0.05), whereas the incidence of Gram-positive bacteria infection is less in the RICU than in the general ward (P<0.05). In the general ward, the incidence of Gram-negative bacteria infection significantly increased (P<0.05) over time, whereas the incidence of Gram-positive bacteria infection significantly decreased from 1996 to 2011 (P<0.05). In the RICU, the incidence of Gram-positive bacteria infection decreased, while Gram-negative bacteria infections increased without statistical significance (P>0.05). Staphylococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were found to be the predominant Gram-positive strains in the general ward (34.70-41.18%) and RICU (41.66-54.87%), respectively (P>0.05). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were the predominant gram negative strains in the general ward (19.17-21.09%) and RICU (29.60-33.88%), respectively (P>0.05). Streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to most antibiotics with a sensitivity of more than 70%. Staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (100%), chloramphenicol (74.36-82.19%), doxycycline (69.57-77.33%), and sulfamethoprim (67.83-72.46%); however, its sensitivity to other antibiotics is low and decreased each year. Sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to most beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and quinolone group antibiotics decreased each year. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution and drug sensitivity of LRTI pathogens exhibit a high divergence between the general ward and RICU. Streptococcus pneumoniae may not be the predominant pathogen in LRTIs in some areas of China.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections in patients with cancer.
AB  - Patients with cancer are at high risk for infections caused by antibiotic resistant gram-negative bacteria. In this review, we summarize trends among the major pathogens and clinical syndromes associated with antibiotic resistant gram-negative bacterial infection in patients with malignancy, with special attention to carbapenem and expanded-spectrum beta-lactam resistance in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia--all major threats to our cancer patients. Optimal therapy for these antibiotic-resistant pathogens still remains to be determined.
TI  - Combining topology and sequence design for the discovery of potent antimicrobial  peptide dendrimers against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant opportunistic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, represent a major public health threat. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and related peptidomimetic systems offer an attractive opportunity to control these pathogens. AMP dendrimers (AMPDs) with high activity against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were now identified by a systematic survey of the peptide sequences within the branches of a distinct type of third-generation peptide dendrimers. Combined topology and peptide sequence design as illustrated here represents a new and general strategy to discover new antimicrobial agents to fight multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens.
TI  - First report of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1-producing strains in Slovakia.
AB  - Occurrence of carbapenemase-producing organisms, including New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is increasingly reported worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of carbapenemase producers among multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolated from blood cultures. All carbapenem-resistant strains collected from December 2011 to December 2012 were analyzed. Presence of carbapenemases was assessed with combined disc test and Carba NP test followed by polymerase chain reaction for carbapenemase genes. Altogether, 30 strains were detected, of which 7 were positive for VIM (23.3%), 6 for NDM-1 (20%), 5 for IMP (16.7%), and KPC was present in one isolate (3.3%). Four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were found to produce more than one carbapenemase. We also present the case report of a patient with Acinetobacter baumannii ventilator-associated pneumonia, followed by sepsis due to Enterococcus faecalis and pan-resistant NDM-1-producing P. aeruginosa. Despite the inappropriate therapy, the patient was successfully treated. This is the first report of NDM-1-producing strains in Slovakia and it contributes to a number of studies mapping the distribution of carbapenemase producers in Europe.
TI  - Molecular characterization and in vitro susceptibilities of beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus to CSE1034 and other beta-lactams.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among 663 clinical isolates obtained from various parts of India and to study the occurrence of different variants of ESBLs among these isolates. METHODS: Phenotypic characterization and susceptibility studies were performed according to the methods described in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. The occurrence of ESBL variants was analyzed with PCR using the previously reported primers. RESULTS: Among the six hundred sixty three isolates, the identified isolates were Acinetobacter baumannii (72), Escherichia coli (218), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30), Klebsiella oxytoca (63), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (264) and Staphylococcus aureus (16). PCR results revealed that approximately 89.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were positive for ESBL followed by Escherichia coli (85.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (76.6%), Klebsiella oxytoca (73.0%), Acinetobacter baumannii (72.2%) and Staphylococcus aureus (31.2%). The overall prevalence of ESBL was 82.5%. The presence of TEM type ESBLs were the predominant (in 186 isolates), followed by SHV (138), OXA (92), CTX-M (65), AmpC (33), KPC (28) and blaZ (5). Of the drugs involved in the study, CSE1034 was found to be the most efficacious against all of ESBL positive clinical isolates showing susceptibility approximately 95.7% with minimal inhibitory concentration values between 0.125 and 8.000 mug/mL for all strains tested. The susceptibilities of penems (meropenem and imipenem and cilastatin) ranged between 83% and 93% for all the isolates. The susceptibilities of other drugs like piperacillin and tazobactam, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, cefoperazone and sulbactam were <45% for all the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study indicated that majority of the isolates was susceptible to CSE1034 and it could be a potent antibacterial agent for the treatment of severe bacterial infections caused by such organisms.
TI  - Etiological factors causing lower respiratory tract infections isolated from hospitalized patients.
AB  - Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) account for 20-30 % of all hospital-acquired contagions. They are characterized by high mortality of hospitalized patients. The most serious form of LRTI is pneumonia, and the most common etiological factors in such cases are bacteria. The article gives the analysis of bacterial flora samples obtained from lower respiratory tract of hospitalized patients. In vitro susceptibility of pathogens to selected antibiotics has also been assessed. We carried out a retrospective analysis of 1,171 bacterial strains isolated from 1,171 patients treated in clinics of the Military Institute of Medicine in Warsaw, Poland. In most cases the samples were collected from an endotracheal or tracheostomic tube (71.5 %) and from bronchoalveolar lavage (21.7 %). The most commonly isolated pathogens included Acinetobacter baumannii (35.8 %), Staphylococcus aureus (27.6 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.4 %), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.2 %). Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria exhibited 100 % susceptibility to colistin only. Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBL+ and Acinetobacter baumannii were most susceptible to carbapenems, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to ceftazidime. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were 100 % susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline. In conclusion, identifying the etiological factors causing infections of the lower respiratory tract and determining their drug-susceptibility is of key importance in empirical treatment.
TI  - One-step species-specific high resolution melting analysis for nosocomial bacteria detection.
AB  - Nosocomial infections are a major public health concern worldwide. Early and accurate identification of nosocomial pathogens which are often multidrug resistant is crucial for prompt treatment. Hence, an alternative real-time polymerase chain reaction coupled with high resolution melting-curve analysis (HRMA) was developed for identification of five nosocomial bacteria. This assay targets species-specific regions of each nosocomial bacteria and produced five distinct melt curves with each representing a particular bacterial species. The melting curves were characterized by peaks of 78.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C for Acinetobacter baumannii, 82.7 +/- 0.2 degrees C for Escherichia coli, 86.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 88.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 74.6 +/- 02 degrees C for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The assay was able to specifically detect the five bacterial species with an overall detection limit of 2 x 10(-2) ng/muL. In conclusion, the HRM assay developed is a simple and rapid method for identification of the selected nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - Arbekacin: another novel agent for treating infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - Arbekacin sulfate (ABK), an aminoglycoside antibiotic, was discovered in 1972 and was derived from dibekacin to stabilize many common aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. ABK shows broad antimicrobial activities against not only Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) but also Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. ABK has been approved as an injectable formulation in Japan since 1990, under the trade name Habekacin, for the treatment of patients with pneumonia and sepsis caused by MRSA. The drug has been used in more than 250,000 patients, and its clinical benefit and safety have been proven over two decades. ABK currently shows promise for the application for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections such as multidrug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii because of its synergistic effect in combination with beta-lactams.
TI  - Relationship between the GOLD combined COPD assessment staging system and bacterial isolation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations, which are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, adversely affect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) prognosis by accelerating loss of lung function. It is important to know the microorganisms that commonly cause exacerbations in the patient groups classified according to clinical and functional characteristics for fast and accurate treatment of acute exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: The last Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) publication recommended a new staging system containing obstruction degree, frequency of exacerbations, and quality of life questionnaires. This study is designed to analyze the relationship between the bacteria isolated in acute exacerbations and new GOLD stages. METHODS: Potentially pathogenic bacteria (PPB) isolation with culture and polymerase chain reaction methods were obtained from 114 acute exacerbation COPD patients, classified into A, B, C, and D groups by analyzing the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) value, COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, and exacerbation frequency according to the new GOLD staging system. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between exacerbation frequency and PPB isolation (P=0.002). There was no relationship between GOLD stage, FEV1, and CAT score with PPB isolation. The isolated bacteria diversity and mixed infection frequency were higher in the GOLD stage D group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated only from D group patients. CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection may cause an acute exacerbation equally in each stage for COPD. The difference in bacterial etiology is more related to exacerbation frequency than FEV1 and CAT scores for an acute exacerbation. Determining exacerbation frequency is significant for treatment success in empirical antibiotic selection.
TI  - Acinetobacter baumannii escape from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the same aerobic gram-negative bacillus and are usually harmless but cause infectious diseases in compromised hosts. Neutrophils play a critical role in infective protection against the extracellular growth of bacteria. Recently, a new biological defense mechanism called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been attracting attention. In present study, we investigated the responsiveness of neutrophils to A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, focusing on NET formation. Neutrophils were co-cultured with A. baumannii or P. aeruginosa, and then DNA, histone and neutrophil elastase were stained, and the formation of NETs was evaluated. Neutrophils stimulated with A. baumannii had spread, but their shapes was maintained, and the nucleus was observed as clearly as that in non-stimulated neutrophils. However, neutrophils stimulated with P. aeruginosa did not maintain their cellular morphology, and the nucleus was disrupted with DNA, histones, and neutrophil elastase released into the extracellular space. These results suggest that A. baumannii does not induce NET formation, in contrast to P. aeruginosa. In addition, we measured expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide in neutrophils, and we found that these expression in P. aeruginosa-stimulated neutrophils was stronger than that in A. baumannii-stimulated neutrophils. Furthermore, A. baumannii was not killed by neutrophils, in contrast to P. aeruginosa. In this study, we show that the reactivity of neutrophils and their biological defense mechanism are different between A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, which is important for understanding the pathogenicity of these bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of the effectiveness of an infection control program in adult intensive care units: a report from a middle-income country.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rates of hand hygiene improvement and health care-associated infections (HAIs) were evaluated after the introduction in 2004 of an infection surveillance and prevention program at a university teaching hospital in a low- to middle-income country. METHODS: Data on hand hygiene compliance, HAI rate, multiresistant organisms, and antibiotic consumption in 4 adult intensive care units (ICUs; medical, general surgery, anesthesiology and reanimation, and neurosurgery) were collected retrospectively for each year from 2004 to 2012. Negative binomial regression modeling with a log link was used to adjust for overdispersion in observations, and the first year of observations served as the baseline for comparing changes in incidence rate ratio (IRR) over the subsequent years. RESULTS: Total hand hygiene compliance improved from 30.5% in 2004 to 43.5% by 2010 (IRR, 1.3; P <.0001) and reached 63.8% by 2012 (IRR, 1.9; P < .0001). The HAI rate was 42.6/1,000 patient-days at baseline and increased significantly thereafter until 2012, when it decreased by 20% to 33.6/1,000 patient-days (IRR, 0.8; P = .001). The rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection was 7.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.89-10.26)/1,000 catheter-days in 2004 and increased to 12.4 (95% CI, 9.98-14.39)/1,000 catheter-days in 2012 (IRR, 1.5; P = .024). The rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia remained stable from the 2004 baseline rate of 31.66/1,000 ventilator-days to the 2012 rate of 24.04/ 1,000 ventilator-days (IRR, 0.88; P = .574). The rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection remained relatively stable between 2004 and 2012 (from 7.92/1,000 catheter-days to 4.97/1,000 catheter-days; P = .101). The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection was 6.24/1,000 patient-days at baseline and decreased significantly to 0.73/1,000 patient-days by 2007 (IRR, 0.13; P <.001) and continued to remain below 2/1,000 patient-days for the next 5 years. The rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection decreased significantly from 8.66/1,000 patient-days in 2004 to 6.09/1,000 patient-days in 2010 (IRR, 0.72; P = .026) and to 5.44/1,000 patient-days by 2012 (IRR, 0.63; P = .002). The rate of Acinetobacter baumannii infection was 14.3/1,000 patient-days at baseline, decreased significantly by 2005 (IRR, 0.73; P = .012), fluctuated between 2006 and 2010, and then decreased significantly to 10.44/1,000 patient-days in 2011 (IRR, 0.74; P = .007) and then to 7.6/1,000 patient-days in 2012 (IRR, 0.53; P < .001). Antibiotic consumption did not decrease noticeably over the 9-year study period. CONCLUSIONS: Hand hygiene improved in all of the ICUs evaluated. Measuring changes in HAI rates in a single health care setting can be statistically challenging, and a bias in the detection rates is not uncommon in the early years of a new infection prevention program. Here, for the first time, implementation of an infection surveillance and prevention program was associated with a reduction in HAI rate.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in patients with hematological malignancies: which is more fatal - cancer or resistant pathogens?
AB  - BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this study was to report the incidence of bloodstream infections (BSIs) and clinically or microbiologically proven bacterial or fungal BSIs during neutropenic episodes in patients with hematological malignancies. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, all patients in the hematology department older than 14 years who developed febrile neutropenia during chemotherapy for hematological cancers were evaluated. Patients were included if they had experienced at least one neutropenic episode between November 2010 and November 2012 due to chemotherapy in the hematology ward. RESULTS: During 282 febrile episodes in 126 patients, 66 (23%) episodes of bacteremia and 24 (8%) episodes of fungemia were recorded in 48 (38%) and 18 (14%) patients, respectively. Gram-negative bacteria caused 74% (n=49) of all bacteremic episodes. Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (n=6) caused 12% and 9% of Gram-negative bacteremia episodes and all bacteremia episodes, respectively. Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria included Acinetobacter baumannii (n=4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1), and Serratia marcescens (n=1). Culture-proven invasive fungal infection occurred in 24 episodes in 18 cases during the study period, with 15 episodes in ten cases occurring in the first study year and nine episodes in eight cases in the second study year. In 13 of 18 cases (72%) with bloodstream yeast infections, previous azole exposure was recorded. Candida parapsilosis, C. glabrata, and C. albicans isolates were resistant to voriconazole and fluconazole. CONCLUSION: BSIs that occur during febrile neutropenic episodes in hematology patients due to Gram-negative bacteria should be treated initially with non-carbapenem-based antipseudomonal therapy taking into consideration antimicrobial stewardship. Non-azole antifungal drugs, including caspofungin and liposomal amphotericin B, should be preferred as empirical antifungal therapy in the events of possible or probable invasive fungal infections with an absence of pulmonary findings due to increase azole resistance.
TI  - [Etiology of surgical site infections in orthopedic surgery after multiple injuries].
AB  - Surgical site infection is one of the most severe complications in patients with  multiple injuries. It causes elongation of hospitalization time, greatly increases costs of treatment and may directly endanger patient's life. The aim of the study was to analyze bacterial flora causing surgical site infections in group of patients with multiple injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on medical history of 31 patients with multiple injuries, who in years 2011-2012 due to surgical site infections required further treatment in Department of Musculoskeletal System Infections. RESULTS: In analyzed material majority of infections were caused by multiple bacteria species--18 (58%). Throughout the isolated flora the most frequent were gram-negative bacteria, especially A. baumanii--16 (29.6%) and P. areuginosa--5 (9.3%). Participation of gram-positive flora which until now was dominating as a cause of musculoskeletal system infections, has significantly decreased. Additionally, in this group we can see dominance of bacteria from Enterococcus genus--E. fecalis--10 (18.5%), and not as it used to be from Staphylococcus--S. aureus--6 (11%), S. epidermidis--3 (5.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The most common were acute infections caused by multiple bacteria species with dominance of gram-negative flora. Very interesting is the fact of fall of infection rate caused by Staphylococci. Monitoring of bacterial etiological factors has a key role in proper antibiotic administration, with is essential in successful surgical treatment.
TI  - Detection of Ambler class A, B and D ss-lactamases among Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates from burn patients.
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the existence of classes A, B and D ss-lactamases among Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa) and Acinetobacter baumannii (A.baumannii) strains isolated from burn patients in Tehran during the years 2012 and 2013. From these strains, the frequency of MBL (metallo-beta-lactamase) and ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) producers were evaluated using CDDT (Combined Disk Diffusion Tests). The prevalence of some related genes, including blaIMP, blaVIM, blaSPM, blaKPC, blaGIM, blaDIM, blaBIC, blaOXA-48, blaCTX-M-15 and blaNDM genes, was evaluated using PCR and sequencing methods. Of the 75 non-fermenter isolates, 47 P.aeruginosa and 28 A.baumannii were isolated and identified. A high rate of resistance to common antibiotics was detected among A.baumannii isolates in particular, showing 100% resistance to 9 tested antibiotics. CDDT showed that 21 (28%) and 25 (34.25%) of the non-fermenter isolates were ESBL and MBL producers respectively. The prevalence of blaCTX-M-15 and blaIMP genes among the 75 non-fermenter isolates was 7 (9.3%) and 1 (1.3%), respectively. Fortunately, no other genes were detected in either of the non-fermenters. The mortality rate due to MBL-producing isolates was 5 (20%). This study showed specific resistance genes exist among some MBL and ESBL gram-negative non-fermenters which were isolated from burn patients in Tehran.
TI  - ISEcp1-mediated transposition of blaKPC into the chromosome of a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii from Puerto Rico.
AB  - Carbapenems are the last-resort antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) hydrolyses beta-lactam antibiotics including the carbapenems. KPCs have been detected in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates worldwide associated with transposon Tn4401 commonly located in plasmids. Acinetobacter baumannii has become an important multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen capable of hydrolysing the carbapenem antibiotics. KPC-producing A. baumannii has so far only been reported in Puerto Rico. During a surveillance study, four KPC-producing A. baumannii with identical pulse type were identified in a single institution. The objectives of this study were to characterize the KPC genetic background and the allelic diversity of one of the isolates. Next-generation sequencing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. Molecular characterization of the isolate demonstrated blaKPC in Tn4401b located in the bacterial chromosome within a 26.5 kb DNA fragment, which included a KQ-like element (18.9 kb) very similar to that described previously in a K. pneumoniae plasmid and a 7.6 kb DNA fragment with 98 % homology to a putative plasmid from Yersinia pestis strain PY-95. Our data suggested that the 26.5 kb DNA fragment harbouring blaKPC was integrated in the chromosome by a transposition event mediated by the transposase of ISEcp1 found in the KQ-like element. MLST showed a novel sequence type, ST250. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of the genetic background of blaKPC in A. baumannii.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia after cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis and systematic review.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common and serious nosocomial infection that threatens patients who have undergone cardiac surgery. This article summarizes its clinical characteristics and provides theoretical evidence for prevention and treatment. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge databases and by manual search. Data involving the prevalence, etiology, risk factors, or clinical outcomes were extracted for systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eleven studies on VAP after cardiac surgery were included. When the results were merged the VAP rate was 21.27/1000 ventilator-days. The prevalence reached 6.37% of all patients and 35.2% of patients who were on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Among the isolated pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa had the highest detection rate, with an average of 23.19%, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (20.15%), Haemophilus influenzae (19.53%), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.68%), Escherichia coli (10.18%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.52%), and Candida albicans (7.20%). Risk factors were also analyzed. We found that New York Heart Association cardiac function class IV, pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, emergency surgery, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic crossclamp time, mechanical ventilation time, reintervention, and reintubation were closely related to the occurrence of VAP; there was no association with gender and diabetes mellitus. Once patients had VAP, mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit were significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: VAP in patients after cardiac surgery is common and has a poor prognosis. It is mainly caused by gram-negative bacteria, and could be affected by a series of factors.
TI  - Evaluation of high-resolution melting curve analysis of ligation-mediated real-time PCR, a rapid method for epidemiological typing of ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter Species) pathogens.
AB  - A single-tube method, ligation-mediated real-time PCR high-resolution melt analysis (LMqPCR HRMA), was modified for the rapid typing of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. (ESKAPE) pathogens. A 97% agreement (60/62 isolates) was achieved in comparison to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) results, which indicates that LMqPCR HRMA is a rapid and accurate screening tool for monitoring nosocomial outbreaks.
TI  - Nascent regional system for alerting infection preventionists about patients with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria: implementation and initial results.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To build and to begin evaluating a regional automated system to notify infection preventionists (IPs) when a patient with a history of gram-negative rod multidrug-resistant organism (GNRMDRO) is admitted to an emergency department (ED) or inpatient setting. DESIGN: Observational, retrospective study. SETTING: Twenty-seven hospitals, mostly in the Indianapolis metropolitan area, in a health information exchange (HIE). PATIENTS: During testing of the new system: 80,180 patients with microbiology cultures between October 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013; 573 had a GNRMDRO. METHODS/INTERVENTION: A Health Level Seven (HL7) data feed from the HIE was obtained, corrected, enhanced, and used for decision support (secure e-mail notification to the IPs). Retrospective analysis of patients with microbiology data (October 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013) and subsequent healthcare encounters (through February 6, 2014). RESULTS: The 573 patients (median age, 66 years; 68% women) had extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (78%), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9%), Acinetobacter baumannii (3%), or other GNR (3%). Body sources were urine (68%), sputum/trachea/bronchoalveolar lavage (13%), wound/skin (6%), blood (6%), or other/unidentified (7%). Between October 1, 2013, and February 6, 2014, 252 (44%) of 573 had an ED or inpatient encounter after the GNRMDRO culture, 47 (19% of 252) at an institution different from where the culture was drawn. During the first 7 weeks of actual alerts (January 29, 2014, through March 19, 2014), alerts were generated regarding 67 patients (19 of 67 admitted elsewhere from where the culture was drawn). CONCLUSIONS: It proved challenging but ultimately feasible to create a regional microbiology-based alert system. Even in a few months, we observed substantial crossover between institutions. This system, if it contributes to timely isolation, may help reduce the spread of GNRMDROs.
TI  - Changing pattern of infectious agents in postneurosurgical meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rates of postneurosurgical infections, particularly meningitis and the most common pathogens have been reported variable during the recent years. The aim of this research was to determine the prevalence of postneurosurgical meningitis and its current spectrum of infectious agent. METHODS: In a descriptive study, the postneurosurgical patients' cerebrospinal fluid was cultured on blood and MacConkey agar plates and evaluated at Microbiology Laboratory. 55 significant isolates as species level were recognized by bacteriological techniques. RESULTS: Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) was the most common organism [29(52.7%)], followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae [8(14.5%)], Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [6(10.9%)], Staphylococcus saprophyticus [5(9.1%)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [3(5.5%)], Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [3(5.5%)], and Enterococcus faecalis [1(1.8%)]. The majority of A. baumannii isolates were carbapenem-resistant. CONCLUSION: Our research revealed that the rate of postneurosurgical meningitis due to carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii has been increased. This finding emphasized the importance of preventive strategies against A. baumannii. The changing pattern of infectious agents in postneurosurgical meningitis over time suggests the necessity of other studies.
TI  - Proteomic characterization of the outer membrane vesicle of Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are produced by various pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. In this study, we isolated OMVs from a representative soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, which has a biodegradative activity toward various aromatic compounds. Proteomic analysis identified the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) OprC, OprD, OprE, OprF, OprH, OprG, and OprW as major components of the OMV of P. putida KT2440. The production of OMVs was dependent on the nutrient availability in the culture media, and the up- or down-regulation of specific OMPs was observed according to the culture conditions. In particular, porins (e.g., benzoate-specific porin, BenF-like porin) and enzymes (e.g., catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, benzoate dioxygenase) for benzoate degradation were uniquely found in OMVs prepared from P. putida KT2440 that were cultured in media containing benzoate as the energy source. OMVs of P. putida KT2440 showed low pathological activity toward cultured cells that originated from human lung cells, which suggests their potential as adjuvants or OMV vaccine carriers. Our results suggest that the protein composition of the OMVs of P. putida KT2440 reflects the characteristics of the total proteome of P. putida KT2440.
TI  - Time-kill effect of levofloxacin on multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii: synergism with imipenem and colistin.
AB  - In the present study, we challenged the concept that levofloxacin should not be used for the management of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) when minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) exceed 2 mug/ml. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and genetically distinct isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 49) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 29) from patients with VAP were exposed over time to levofloxacin, imipenem, colistin and their combinations. Synergy between levofloxacin and imipenem was found in 55.3 % and between levofloxacin and colistin in 90.9 % of isolates of P. aeruginosa within the first 4 h of growth. Synergy with imipenem but not with colistin was dependent of the MIC. Synergy between levofloxacin and imipenem was found in 58.6 % of isolates of A. baumannii after 24 h of growth. Considerable synergy was found between levofloxacin and colistin, reaching 84.8 % of isolates of A.baumannii after 6 h of growth. Synergy was independent from the MIC. These results create hopes that levofloxacin can be used as combination therapy for infections by MDR bacteria.
TI  - Risks for multidrug-resistant pathogens in the ICU.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The impact of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) is rising  and often underestimated. The epidemiology of MDROs is extremely complex and multifactorial. There is increasing antibiotic resistance, mainly related to antibiotic pressure and patients' characteristics. RECENT FINDINGS: Emphasis on MDRO epidemiology is needed to better understand current strategies of prevention and management. Among them, antibiotic stewardship has been one of the most successful strategies. It is important to note that there is a controversial issue when considering community and healthcare-related infections. In addition, different strategies have been determined to find the impact and optimal use of recently launched antibiotics for MDRO treatment. SUMMARY: Infections with MDROs can prolong hospital stay, promote antibiotic use and prolong duration of mechanical ventilation. Some points should be further explored in clinical research such as the heterogeneity of healthcare-associated pneumonia and the need of new drug development. Resistance to non fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, rising minimum inhibitory concentration in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and spread of MDROs in patients without known risk factors suggest a review of guideline validation, taking into account ecology and severity of patient illness to provide timely and appropriate empiric therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of meropenem regimens suppressing emergence of resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii with human simulated exposure in an in vitro intravenous-infusion hollow-fiber infection model.
AB  - The emergence of resistance to carbapenems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be suppressed by optimizing the administration of meropenem. However, whether the same is true for Acinetobacter baumannii is not fully understood. We assessed the bactericidal activity of meropenem and its potency to suppress the emergence of resistance in A. baumannii with human simulated exposure in an in vitro intravenous-infusion hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM). Two clinical strains of carbapenem-susceptible multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (CS-MDRAB), CSRA24 and CSRA91, were used, and their MICs and mutant prevention concentrations (MPCs) were determined. Six meropenem dosage regimens (0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 g given every 8 h [q8h] with a 0.5-h or 3-h infusion for seven consecutive days) were simulated and then evaluated in the HFIM. Both the total population and resistant subpopulations of the two strains were quantified. Drug concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. All dosage regimens, except for the lowest dosage (0.5 g for both the 0.5-h and 3-h infusions), showed 3-log CFU/ml bacterial killing. Dosage regimens of 2.0 g with 0.5-h and 3-h infusions exhibited an obvious bactericidal effect and suppressed resistance. Selective amplification of subpopulations with reduced susceptibility to meropenem was suppressed with a percentage of the dosage interval in which meropenem concentrations exceeded the MPC (T>MPC) of >/=20% or with a ratio of T>MPC to the percentage of the dosage interval in which drug concentrations are within the mutant selection window of >/=0.25. Our in vitro data support the use of a high dosage of meropenem (2.0 g q8h) for the treatment of severe infection caused by CS-MDRAB.
TI  - Increasing resistance rate to carbapenem among blood culture isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a university-affiliated hospital in China, 2004-2011.
AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate the profile of antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative bacteria in blood cultures from 2004-2011. Pathogens from positive blood cultures were subcultured, and identified in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from January 2004 to December 2011. The antibiotic resistance pattern was analyzed by WHONET 5.4. A total of 1224 cases of Gram-negative bacterial isolates were documented, accounting for 38.6% of the total pathogens isolated from positive blood cultures in the 8-year period. The isolation rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii increased nearly three times over the same time span. Most Gram-negative bacteria isolates, except the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a significantly increased resistance rate to cephalosporins (in particular third/fourth generation cephalosporins). Noteworthy, the antimicrobial resistance of K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates to carbapenem (imipenem and meropenem) was significantly increased and the resistant rate to carbapenem was >80.0% in A. baumannii in 2011. The results from PCR detection for carbapenemases were as follows: 82.8% (24/29) isolates of K. pneumoniae carried the kpc-2 gene; only three metallo-beta-lactamase-positive P. aeruginosa isolates were detected; and 93.1% (67/72) A. baumannii isolates were blaOXA-23 positive. The antimicrobial resistance rate of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from blood cultures significantly increased from 2004 to 2011, with significant resistance to the third/fourth generation cephalosporins and carbapenem.
TI  - Preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  - The ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. A recombinantly produced CDH from Myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mM or 2 mM cellobiose as substrate. Biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by CDH when supplemented with 1mM cellobiose. The CDH/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interestingly, CDH was also able to produce H(2)O(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exPS) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. The H(2)O(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exPS were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. Hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for CDH as well as destabilises the biofilm. Furthermore, CDH suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. Incorporation of the CDH/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.
TI  - [Prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.
TI  - Carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in the nosocomial setting in Latin America.
AB  - Abstract Increasing prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains in the nosocomial setting in Latin America represents an emerging challenge to public health, as the range of therapeutic agents active against these pathogens becomes increasingly constrained. We review published reports from 2002 to 2013, compiling data from throughout the region on prevalence, mechanisms of resistance and molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. We find rates of carbapenem resistance up to 66% for P. aeruginosa and as high as 90% for A. baumannii isolates across the different countries of Latin America, with the resistance rate of A. baumannii isolates greater than 50% in many countries. An outbreak of the SPM-1 carbapenemase is a chief cause of resistance in P. aeruginosa strains in Brazil. Elsewhere in Latin America, members of the VIM family are the most important carbapenemases among P. aeruginosa strains. Carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii in Latin America is predominantly due to the oxacillinases OXA-23, OXA-58 and (in Brazil) OXA-143. Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii to colistin remains high, however, development of resistance has already been detected in some countries. Better epidemiological data are needed to design effective infection control interventions.
TI  - Microbiology, resistance patterns, and risk factors of mortality in ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in a Northern Thai tertiary-care university based general surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occurrence, causative pathogens, and resistance patterns in surgical intensive care units (SICU) are different between Western and developing Asian countries. In Thailand, resistant organisms have progressively increased in the last decade. However, the evidence describing causes of VAP and its outcomes, especially secondary to resistant pathogens, in Asian developing countries' SICUs is very limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the incidence, pathogen characteristics, and risk factors that impact mortality and patient survival following VAP in a tertiary Northern Thai SICU. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2012, VAP occurred in a total of 150 patients in Chiang Mai University's general SICUs (6.3+/-2.8 cases per 1,000 mechanical ventilator days). The following clinical data were collected from 46 patients who died and 104 patients who survived: microbiologic results, susceptible patterns, and survival status at hospital discharge. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were classified as susceptible, multidrug resistant (MDR), extensively drug resistant (XDR), and pan-drug resistant (PDR). The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated for risk factor analysis. RESULTS: Regarding the microbiology, gram negative organisms were the major pathogens (n=142, 94.7%). The first three most common organisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (38.7% of all organisms, mortality 41.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%, mortality 30.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.7%, mortality 16%) respectively. The most common gram positive organism was Staphylococcus aureus (4.0%, mortality 50%). The median day of VAP occurrence were significantly different between the three groups (P<0.01): susceptible (day 4), MDR (day 5), and XDR (day 6.5). Only half of all VAP cases were caused by susceptible organisms. Antibiotic resistance was demonstrated by 49.3% of the gram negative organisms and 62.5% of the gram positive organisms. Extensive drug resistance was evident only in Acinetobacter baumannii (30.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.3%). No pan-drug resistance was found during surveillance. The significant HR risk factors were age (P=0.03), resistant organisms (P=0.04), XDR (P=0.02), and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score (<0.01). Acinetobacter baumannii (P=0.06) and intubation due to severe sepsis (P=0.08) demonstrated a trend toward a significant increase in the HR. On the other hand, there were significantly decreased HRs in trauma patients (P=0.01). Initial administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy had a tendency toward a significant decrease in the HR (P=0.08). CONCLUSION: Gram negative organisms were the primary cause of bacterial VAP in Chiang Mai University's general SICU. Resistant strains were present in half of all VAP cases and were associated with the day of VAP onset. Regarding risk factors, age, acute physiology, chronic health evaluation II score, resistant organisms (especially XDR), and being a non-trauma patient increased the risk of mortality.
TI  - [Pathogenic analysis of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the pediatric intensive care unit in high-altitude areas].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogens of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)  and their drug resistance in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in high-altitude areas and to provide a clinical basis for the prevention and treatment of VAP. METHODS: A total of 94 children with VAP hospitalized in the PICU in high-altitude areas between June 2011 and June 2013 were recruited. Their lower respiratory tract secretions were collected for bacterial culture and drug sensitivity test. RESULTS: Of the 94 children with VAP, 22 (23%) had a single bacterial infection, and 72 (77%) had mixed infections, mostly with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii (17 cases, 27%). Of the 178 isolated strains of pathogens, 139 (78%) were Gram-negative bacteria (G(-) bacteria), mainly including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 26 (15%) were Gram-positive bacteria (G(+) bacteria), mainly including Staphylococcus aureus, and 13 (7%) were fungi, mainly including Candida albicans. Most G(-) bacteria had a high drug resistance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was extensively drug-resistant. Acinetobacter baumannii was only highly sensitive to cefoperazone/sulbactam and imipenem. Multidrug resistance (methicillin resistance) was found in G(+) bacteria, for which vancomycin was effective. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of VAP in high-altitude areas are mostly G- bacteria, which may cause mixed infections and develop drug resistance. This provides guidance for the rational use of antimicrobial drugs and the development of key prevention and control measures for VAP.
TI  - Activity of the type I signal peptidase inhibitor MD3 against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria alone and in combination with colistin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Effective treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections is increasingly challenging due to the spread of multidrug-resistant strains and a lack of new antimicrobials in development. Bacterial type I signal peptidases (SPases) represent a highly conserved and essential target for inhibition by novel compounds. SPases are required for the effective processing of membrane translocated proteins involved in core functions related to metabolism, virulence and resistance. In this study we assessed the biochemical and functional activity of a novel synthetic inhibitor (MD3) of SPases against a wide range of Gram-negative pathogens. METHODS: The activity and specificity of MD3 for recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa SPase (LepB) and a genetically engineered LepB-regulatable strain were investigated. Antimicrobial activity of the compound alone and in combination with outer membrane-permeabilizing agents (sodium hexametaphosphate, colistin) was also determined against a collection of P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. RESULTS: MD3 was found to inactivate the P. aeruginosa LepB protein (IC50 10 muM), resulting in antimicrobial effects potentiated in the presence of colistin. MD3 also demonstrated potent activity against wild-type and multidrug-resistant strains of A. baumannii and S. maltophilia with MICs ranging from 0.5 to 14 mg/L in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of colistin. CONCLUSIONS: MD3 is a novel inhibitor of bacterial SPase in a range of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria. The antimicrobial activity is potentiated in combination with colistin and suggests that SPase inhibition warrants further exploration as a basis for future mono or combination therapies.
TI  - Frequency and clinical outcomes of ESKAPE bacteremia in solid organ transplantation and the risk factors for mortality.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although bacteremias caused by the 6 ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) have recently been highlighted as a serious complication in solid organ transplant (SOT), more information is urgently needed. We sought to investigate the frequency and clinical outcomes of ESKAPE bacteremia in SOT and determine the risk factors for mortality. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of bacteremia after SOT was reviewed. Risk factors for mortality caused by ESKAPE bacteremia were identified. RESULTS: Eighty-four episodes of bacteremia were caused by ESKAPE strains. Of these strains, 41 were caused by resistant ESKAPE (rESKAPE) organisms. The only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with ESKAPE was septic shock (odds ratio [OR] = 21.017, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.038-87.682, P < 0.001). The factors for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with rESKAPE bacteremia were septic shock (OR = 16.558, 95% CI = 6.620-104.668, P = 0.003) and age >/=40 years (OR = 7.521, 95% CI = 1.196-47.292, P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: To improve the outcomes of transplantation, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when older SOT recipients with bacteremia due to ESKAPE/rESKAPE organisms present with septic shock.
TI  - Waging war against extended spectrum Beta lactamase and metallobetalactamase producing pathogens- novel adjuvant antimicrobial agent cse1034- an extended hope.
AB  - Preamble: In the visage of multidrug resistance among gram negative bacilli, we look forward to carbapenem group of drugs as empiric choice in seriously ill patients. However increasing resistance to carbapenems, the last resort, is of growing concern for all. It's high time to look beyond Carbapenems and emphasize on Carbapenem sparers. OBJECTIVE: This study is to find the susceptibility pattern of the novel adjuvant antimicrobial CSE 1034 a combination of Ceftriaxone+sulbactam+disodium edetate for the current ESBL and MBL isolates in a tertiary care centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 823 gram negative bacterial isolates were obtained from different clinical specimens during the period of March, 2013 to October, 2013. The overall prevalence of metallobetalactamase producing gram negative organisms was 11 percent (n=91). We included a total of 141 clinical isolates for this study. RESULTS: Among 141 clinical isolates, 50 isolates (35%) were ESBL producers and 91 (65%) were MBL producers. Maximum numbers of ESBL producers were identified in Escherichia coli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Proteus spp. Maximum numbers of MBL producers were identified in Klebsiella pneumoniae followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CSE 1034 (Ceftriaxone+sulbactam+disodium edetate) showed fairly good in-vitro susceptibility for these ESBL and MBL producing isolates. It exhibited 64 % to 100% susceptibility and 18% to 22% intermediate sensitivity to ESBL producing isolates and 42 % to 89 % susceptible and 10 % to 51 % intermediate response to MBL producing isolates. CONCLUSION: With increasing resistance to the commonly prescribed drugs used to treat infections caused by variety of gram negative organisms, Ceftriaxone+sulbactam+disodium edetate, a novel Antibiotic Adjuvant Entity (AAE) may be a promising option.
TI  - Gram-negative infections in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units of Latin  America.
AB  - In order to review the epidemiology of Gram-negative infections in the pediatric  and neonatal intensive care units (PICUs and NICUs) of Latin America a systematic search of PubMed and targeted search of SciELO was performed to identify relevant articles published since 2005. Independent cohort data indicated that overall infection rates were higher in Latin American PICUs and NICUs versus developed countries (range, 5%-37% vs 6%-15%, respectively). Approximately one third of Latin American patients with an acquired PICU or NICU infection died, and crude mortality was higher among extremely low-birth-weight infants and those with an infection caused by Gram-negative bacteria. In studies reporting > 100 isolates, the frequency of Gram-negative pathogens varied from 31% (Colombia) to 63% (Mexico), with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli the predominant pathogens in almost all countries, and Acinetobacter spp. and Serratia spp. isolated sporadically. The activity of quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins against P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., and Enterobacteria was seriously compromised, coincident with a high prevalence of circulating extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Furthermore, we identified two observational studies conducted in Chile and Brazil reporting infections by P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in PICUs, demonstrating resistance to carbapenems, and two outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in Colombia and Brazil. The endemicity of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections in Latin American PICUs and NICUs is punctuated by intermittent clonal outbreaks. The problem may be alleviated by ensuring ICUs are less crowded, increasing staffing levels of better-trained health care personnel, and implementing antimicrobial stewardship and surveillance programs.
TI  - Identification of Acinetobacter baumannii serum-associated antibiotic efflux pump inhibitors.
AB  - Adaptive antibiotic resistance is a newly described phenomenon by which Acinetobacter baumannii induces efflux pump activity in response to host-associated environmental cues that may, in part, account for antibiotic treatment failures against clinically defined susceptible strains. To that end, during adaptation to growth in human serum, the organism induces approximately 22 putative efflux-associated genes and displays efflux-mediated minocycline tolerance at antibiotic concentrations corresponding to patient serum levels. Here, we show that in addition to minocycline, growth in human serum elicits A. baumannii efflux-mediated tolerance to the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, meropenem, tetracycline, and tigecycline. Moreover, using a whole-cell high-throughput screen and secondary assays, we identified novel serum-associated antibiotic efflux inhibitors that potentiated the activities of antibiotics toward serum-grown A. baumannii. Two compounds, Acinetobacter baumannii efflux pump inhibitor 1 (ABEPI1) [(E)-4-((4-chlorobenzylidene)amino)benezenesulfonamide] and ABEPI2 [N-tert-butyl-2-(1-tert-butyltetrazol-5-yl)sulfanylacetamide], were shown to lead to minocycline accumulation within A. baumannii during serum growth and inhibit the efflux potential of the organism. While both compounds also inhibited the antibiotic efflux properties of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, they did not display significant cytotoxicity toward human cells or mammalian Ca(2+) channel inhibitory effects, suggesting that ABEPI1 and ABEPI2 represent promising structural scaffolds for the development of new classes of bacterial antibiotic efflux pump inhibitors that can be used to potentiate the activities of current and future antibiotics for the therapeutic intervention of Gram-negative bacterial infections.
TI  - Highly drug-resistant pathogens implicated in burn-associated bacteremia in an Iraqi burn care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. Increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. We describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in Iraq. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between July 2008 and September 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in Iraq who developed sepsis. RESULTS: In 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. Sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% CI 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. The most commonly isolated organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), Staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), Acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and Enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). A high proportion of Enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and S. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. For gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Burn patients with sepsis in Iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. Effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of Iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.
TI  - Characterization of newly isolated lytic bacteriophages active against Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Based on genotyping and host range, two newly isolated lytic bacteriophages, myovirus vB_AbaM_Acibel004 and podovirus vB_AbaP_Acibel007, active against Acinetobacter baumannii clinical strains, were selected from a new phage library for further characterization. The complete genomes of the two phages were analyzed. Both phages are characterized by broad host range and essential features of potential therapeutic phages, such as short latent period (27 and 21 min, respectively), high burst size (125 and 145, respectively), stability of activity in liquid culture and low frequency of occurrence of phage-resistant mutant bacterial cells. Genomic analysis showed that while Acibel004 represents a novel bacteriophage with resemblance to some unclassified Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages, Acibel007 belongs to the well-characterized genus of the Phikmvlikevirus. The newly isolated phages can serve as potential candidates for phage cocktails to control A. baumannii infections.
TI  - Multiplex PCR for joint amplification of carbapenemase genes of molecular classes A, B, and D.
AB  - Here we present a method for joint amplification of genes of carbapenemases of molecular classes A, B, and D for hybridization analysis on DNA microarrays. Using new-generation DNA polymerase KAPA2G Fast (KAPA Biosystems, USA) together with optimization of the conditions for the multiplex PCR with 20 primer pairs allowed us to carry out joint amplification of full-length genes of seven different types of carbapenemases (KPC, VIM, IMP, SPM, SIM, GIM, and OXA) with simultaneous inclusion of biotin as a label. Yield of the labeled PCR product sufficient for further analysis by microarray hybridization was achieved 40 min after the start of the reaction. This reduced the total duration of DNA identification techniques, including sample preparation stage, to 4 h. The method for gene identification by DNA microarrays with the improved stage of amplification of specific carbapenemase genes was tested with clinical strains of gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacteriaceae spp. with different sensitivity towards carbapenems according to phenotyping tests. All clinical strains of A. baumannii resistant to carbapenems were found to have genes of OXA-type carbapenemases (subtypes OXA-51, OXA-23, OXA-40, and OXA-58), and clinical strains of P. aeruginosa resistant to carbapenems were found to possess the gene of VIM-type metallo-beta-lactamase (subtype VIM-2). When testing clinical strains sensitive to carbapenems, carbapenemase genes were not detected. Thus, the method of identifying carbapenemase genes on DNA microarrays is characterized by high accuracy and can be used in clinical microbiology laboratories for express diagnostics of resistance to carbapenems.
TI  - Factors influencing ventilator-associated pneumonia in cancer patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: With increasing survival periods and diversification of treatment methods, treatment of critically ill cancer patients has become an important factor influencing patient prognosis. Patients with cancer are at high risk of infections and subsequent complications. This study investigated the incidence and factors contributing to the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study investigated the incidence of VAP and factors leading to infection in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a cancer center from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013. RESULTS: The incidence of VAP was 2.13 cases per 1,000 days of intubation, and 13 of 288 patients (4.5%) developed VAP. Lung cancer was the most common cancer associated with VAP (N=7, 53.9%), and longer hospital stays and intubation were associated with increased VAP incidence. In the group using a "ventilator bundle," the incidence was 1.14 cases per 1,000 days compared to 2.89 cases per 1,000 days without its use; however, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.158). Age (>/= 65, OR=5.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.29-23.95), surgery (OR=3.78, 95%CI=1.05- 13.78), and tracheotomy (OR=4.46, 95%CI=1.00-19.85) were significant VAP risk factors. The most common causative organisms were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=4, 30.8% each), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans (N=2, 15.4% each). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pneumonia among critically ill cancer patients is highest in those with lung cancer, but lower than among non-cancer patients. The length of hospital stay and time on mechanical ventilation are important risk factors for development of VAP. Although not statistically significant, "ventilator bundle" care is an effective intervention that delays or reduces incidence of VAP. Major risk factors for VAP include age (>/= 65 years), surgery, and tracheostomy, while fungi, gram-negative bacteria, and multidrug-resistant organisms were identified as the major causative pathogens of VAP in this study.
TI  - Rapid identification of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative bacteria with an oligonucleotide microarray-based assay.
AB  - Rapid molecular identification of carbapenemase genes in Gram-negative bacteria is crucial for infection control and prevention, surveillance and for epidemiological purposes. Furthermore, it may have a significant impact upon determining the appropriate initial treatment and greatly benefit for critically ill patients. A novel oligonucleotide microarray-based assay was developed to simultaneously detect genes encoding clinically important carbapenemases as well as selected extended (ESBL) and narrow spectrum (NSBL) beta-lactamases directly from clonal culture material within few hours. Additionally, a panel of species specific markers was included to identify Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii/braakii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. The assay was tested using a panel of 117 isolates collected from urinary, blood and stool samples. For these isolates, phenotypic identifications and susceptibility tests were available. An independent detection of carbapenemase, ESBL and NSBL genes was carried out by various external reference laboratories using PCR methods. In direct comparison, the microarray correctly identified 98.2% of the covered carbapenemase genes. This included blaVIM (13 out of 13), blaGIM (2/2), blaKPC (27/27), blaNDM (5/5), blaIMP-2/4/7/8/13/14/15/16/31 (10/10), blaOXA-23 (12/13), blaOXA-40-group (7/7), blaOXA-48-group (32/33), blaOXA-51 (1/1) and blaOXA-58 (1/1). Furthermore, the test correctly identified additional beta-lactamases [blaOXA-1 (16/16), blaOXA-2 (4/4), blaOXA-9 (33/33), OXA-10 (3/3), blaOXA-51 (25/25), blaOXA-58 (2/2), CTX-M1/M15 (17/17) and blaVIM (1/1)]. In direct comparison to phenotypical identification obtained by VITEK or MALDI-TOF systems, 114 of 117 (97.4%) isolates, including Acinetobacter baumannii (28/28), Enterobacter spec. (5/5), Escherichia coli (4/4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (62/63), Klebsiella oxytoca (0/2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12/12), Citrobacter freundii (1/1) and Citrobacter braakii (2/2), were correctly identified by a panel of species specific probes. This assay might be easily extended, adapted and transferred to point of care platforms enabling fast surveillance, rapid detection and appropriate early treatment of infections caused by multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii as the major cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care unit patients at an infectious disease hospital in southern Vietnam.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a serious healthcare-associated infection that affects up to 30 % of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. The bacterial aetiology and corresponding antimicrobial susceptibility of VAP is highly variable, and can differ between countries, national provinces and even between different wards in the same hospital. We aimed to understand and document changes in the causative agents of VAP and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles retrospectively over an 11 year period in a major infectious disease hospital in southern Vietnam. Our analysis outlined a significant shift from Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Acinetobacter spp. as the most prevalent bacteria isolated from quantitative tracheal aspirates in patients with VAP in this setting. Antimicrobial resistance was common across all bacterial species and we found a marked proportional annual increase in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. over a 3 year period from 2008 (annual trend; odds ratio 1.656, P = 0.010). We further investigated the possible emergence of a carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clone by multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis, finding a blaOXA-23-positive strain that was associated with an upsurge in the isolation of this pathogen. We additionally identified a single blaNDM-1-positive A. baumannii isolate. This work highlights the emergence of a carbapenem-resistant clone of A. baumannii and a worrying trend of antimicrobial resistance in the ICU of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
TI  - French regional surveillance program of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli: results from a 2-year period.
AB  - In February 2011, the CARB-LR group was created as a sentinel laboratory-based surveillance network to control the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CR GNB) in a French Southern Region. We report the epidemiological results of a 2-year study. All the Gram-negative bacilli isolates detected in the different labs (hospital and community settings) of a French Southern Region and with reduced susceptibility to ertapenem and/or imipenem were characterised with regard to antibiotic resistance, bla genes content, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) profiles and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). A total of 221 strains were analysed. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most prevalent carbapenemase-producing bacteria, with a majority of OXA-23 producers (n = 37). One isolate co-produced OXA-23 and OXA-58 enzymes. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) (OXA-48 producer: n = 29, KPC producer: n = 1), followed by Escherichia coli (OXA-48 producer: n = 8, KPC producer: n = 1) and Enterobacter cloacae (OXA-48 producer, n = 1). One isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa produced a VIM-1 carbapenemase. A clonal diversity of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli was noted with different MLSTs. On the other hand, almost all OXA-23-producing A. baumannii strains belonged to the widespread ST2/international clone II. The link between the detection of CR GNB and a foreign country was less obvious, suggesting the beginning of a local cross-transmission. The number of CR GNB cases in our French Southern Region has sharply increased very recently due to the diffusion of OXA-48 producers.
TI  - [A prospective randomized controlled trial on effect of norvancomycin tube sealing for prevention of central venous catheter-related infection in critical patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of tube-sealing with norvancomycin and  heparin saline mixture for prevention of central venous catheter-related infection (CRI). METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed. 120 patients who were admitted to department of critical care medicine from January 2012 to January 2014 were included, with their subclavian vein catheterization installation time longer than 48 hours, age over 18 years and younger than 80 years, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score reaching 10-29. The patients were divided into two groups using a random number table, and finally 116 patients were enrolled. Norvancomycin and heparin saline mixture were used for tube sealing in the intervention group (n=56), while only heparin saline was used in the control group (n=60). The incidence of CRI, catheter correlated spectrum of pathogens, adverse events, mortality, hospital day, catheter retention time, and hospital costs were compared between two groups. RESULTS: (1) There was no significant difference in the incidence of CRI between intervention group and control group [7.14% (4/56) vs. 8.33% (5/60), chi(2)=0.058, P=1.000]. There was no catheter pathogenic colonization in the intervention group, but there were 2 cases of catheter pathogenic colonization in control group. (2) A total of 7 pathogens were found in two groups. Three cases with pathogenic bacteria was found in the intervention group, with 1 case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 case Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1 case fungi. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, fungi, and Acinetobacter baumannii was found in the control group, with 1 case of each. There was no significantly statistical difference between two groups (all P>0.05), but there was a decreasing trend of Gram-positive cocci infection in the intervention group. (3) There was no significant difference in the catheter thrombosis, local bleeding or hematoma, catheter dislocation and other adverse events between intervention group and control group [21.43% (12/56) vs. 23.33% (14/60), chi(2)=0.060, P=0.806]. (4) There were no significant differences in mortality [7.14% (4/56) vs. 8.33% (5/60), chi(2)=0.058, P=1.000], hospital day (35.9+/-15.2 days vs. 34.1+/-16.3 days, t=16.330, P=0.620), catheter retention time (25.0+/-4.5 days vs. 24.5+/-5.1 days, t=26.427, P=2.560) and cost of hospitalization (10 thousand Yuan: 3.42+/-1.22 vs. 3.72+/-1.30, t=13.215, P=1.560) between intervention group and control group. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with central venous catheter, application norvancomycin with heparin saline mixture for tube sealing did not reduce the incidence of CRI, the incidence of adverse events and mortality, does not reduce hospitalization time, catheter retention time and hospital costs, but may reduce the catheter colonization and infection of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water.
AB  - AIM: Super-oxidized water is one of the broad spectrum disinfectants, which was introduced recently. There are many researches to find reliable chemicals which are effective, inexpensive, easy to obtain and use, and effective for disinfection of microorganisms leading hospital infections. Antimicrobial activity of super-oxidized water is promising. The aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as high level disinfectant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, super-oxidized water obtained from Medilox(R) [Soosan E & C, Korea] device, which had been already installed in our hospital, was used. Antimicrobial activities of different concentrations of super-oxidized water (1/1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20, 1/50, 1/100) at different exposure times (1, 2, 5, 10, 30 min) against six ATCC strains, eight antibiotic resistant bacteria, yeasts and molds were evaluated using qualitative suspension test. Dey-Engley Neutralizing Broth [Sigma-Aldrich, USA] was used as neutralizing agent. RESULTS: Medilox(R) was found to be effective against all standard strains (Acinetobacter baumannii 19606, Escherichia coli 25922, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Klebsiella pneumoniae 254988, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, Staphylococcus aureus 29213), all clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Myroides spp.), and all yeastsat 1/1 dilution in >/=1 minute. It was found to be effective on Aspergillus flavus at 1/1 dilution in >/=2 minutes and on certain molds in >/=5 minutes. CONCLUSION: Medilox(R) super-oxidized water is a broad spectrum, on-site producible disinfectant, which is effective on bacteria and fungi and can be used for the control of nosocomial infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria causing nosocomial urinary tract infections in an Iranian referral teaching hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gram-negative bacilli are the most important cause of nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTIs). The production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes is a common mechanism of resistance among these bacteria. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of ESBL producing Gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial UTI in a referral hospital as well as their susceptibility pattern to the most commonly used antibiotics. METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional study performed over a 6-month period, urinary specimens obtained from hospitalized patients with documented culture-proved nosocomial UTI (age range of 1-87 years). Isolated aerobic Gram-negative bacteria underwent further microbiologic tests for detection of ESBL, as well as antimicrobial susceptibility test using Kirby-Bauer (disk diffusion) and E-test methods. FINDINGS: During the study period, 213 urine samples were detected to have growth of Gram-negative organism. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated organism (61%). ESBL was detected in 102 isolates including 38.5% of E. coli, 39.5% of Klebsiella pneumonia, 88.5% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 100% of Acinetobacter baumannii strains. Imipenem and meropenem were the most effective antibiotics on E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains. P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii strains showed high resistance to all tested antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Large numbers of Gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial UTIs produce ESBL with most being multidrug-resistant. Therefore, routine ESBL detection testing and subsequent antibiogram with disk diffusion method could be useful to determine the best treatment options for UTI.
TI  - Engineered endolysin-based "Artilysins" to combat multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - The global threat to public health posed by emerging multidrug-resistant bacteria in the past few years necessitates the development of novel approaches to combat bacterial infections. Endolysins encoded by bacterial viruses (or phages) represent one promising avenue of investigation. These enzyme-based antibacterials efficiently kill Gram-positive bacteria upon contact by specific cell wall hydrolysis. However, a major hurdle in their exploitation as antibacterials against Gram-negative pathogens is the impermeable lipopolysaccharide layer surrounding their cell wall. Therefore, we developed and optimized an approach to engineer these enzymes as outer membrane-penetrating endolysins (Artilysins), rendering them highly bactericidal against Gram-negative pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Artilysins combining a polycationic nonapeptide and a modular endolysin are able to kill these (multidrug-resistant) strains in vitro with a 4 to 5 log reduction within 30 min. We show that the activity of Artilysins can be further enhanced by the presence of a linker of increasing length between the peptide and endolysin or by a combination of both polycationic and hydrophobic/amphipathic peptides. Time-lapse microscopy confirmed the mode of action of polycationic Artilysins, showing that they pass the outer membrane to degrade the peptidoglycan with subsequent cell lysis. Artilysins are effective in vitro (human keratinocytes) and in vivo (Caenorhabditis elegans). Importance: Bacterial resistance to most commonly used antibiotics is a major challenge of the 21st century. Infections that cannot be treated by first-line antibiotics lead to increasing morbidity and mortality, while millions of dollars are spent each year by health care systems in trying to control antibiotic-resistant bacteria and to prevent cross-transmission of resistance. Endolysins--enzymes derived from bacterial viruses--represent a completely novel, promising class of antibacterials based on cell wall hydrolysis. Specifically, they are active against Gram-positive species, which lack a protective outer membrane and which have a low probability of resistance development. We modified endolysins by protein engineering to create Artilysins that are able to pass the outer membrane and become active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, two of the most hazardous drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in China: SMART China 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends program monitors the activity of antibiotics against aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (GNBs) from intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) in patients worldwide. METHODS: In 2011, 1 929 aerobic and facultative GNBs from 21 hospitals in 16 cities in China were collected. All isolates were tested using a panel of 12 antimicrobial agents, and susceptibility was determined following the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Among the Gram-negative pathogens causing IAIs, Escherichia coli (47.3%) was the most commonly isolated, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (8.3%). Enterobacteriaceae comprised 78.8% (1521/1929) of the total isolates. Among the antimicrobial agents tested, ertapenem and imipenem were the most active agents against Enterobacteriaceae, with susceptibility rates of 95.1% and 94.4%, followed by amikacin (93.9%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (87.7%). Susceptibility rates of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime against Enterobacteriaceae were 38.3%, 38.3%, 61.1%, and 50.8%, respectively. The leastactive agent against Enterobacteriaceae was ampicillin/sulbactam (25.9%). The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) rates among E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis were 68.8%, 38.1%, 41.2%, and 57.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Enterobacteriaceae were the major pathogens causing IAIs, and the most active agents against the study isolates (including those producing ESBLs) were ertapenem, imipenem, and amikacin. Including the carbapenems, most agents exhibited reduced susceptibility against ESBL-positive and multidrug-resistant isolates.
TI  - A broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. Their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. Here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens. Combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature P. aeruginosa biofilms. In addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced P. aeruginosa PA14 preexisting biofilms. PCR studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. Thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Risk factors for tracheobronchial acquisition of resistant Gram-negative bacterial pathogens in mechanically ventilated ICU patients.
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for tracheobronchial acquisition with the most common resistant Gram-negative bacteria in the intensive care unit (ICU) during the first week after intubation and mechanical ventilation. Tracheobronchial and oropharyngeal cultures were obtained at admission, after 48 hours, and after 7 days of mechanical ventilation. Patient characteristics, interventions, and antibiotic usage were recorded. Among 71 eligible patients with two negative bronchial cultures for resistant Gram-negative bacteria (at admission and within 48 hours), 41 (58%) acquired bronchial resistant Gram-negative bacteria by day 7. Acquisition strongly correlated with presence of the same pathogens in the oropharynx: Acinetobacter baumannii [odds ratio (OR) = 20.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.5-73.6], Klebsiella pneumoniae (OR = 8.0, 95% CI: 1.9-33.6), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR = 27, 95%: CI 2.7-273). Bronchial acquisition with resistant K. pneumoniae also was associated with chronic liver disease (OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.0-15.3), treatment with aminoglycosides (OR = 4.9, 95% CI: 1.4-18.2), tigecycline (OR = 4.9, 95% CI: 1.4-18.2), and linezolid (OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.1-15.0). In multivariate analysis, treatment with tigecycline and chronic liver disease were independently associated with bronchial resistant K. pneumoniae acquisition. Our results show a high incidence of tracheobronchial acquisition with resistant Gram-negative microorganisms in the bronchial tree of newly intubated patients. Oropharynx colonization with the same pathogens and specific antibiotics use were independent risk factors.
TI  - [Epidemiology of burn wound infection in Rabat, Morocco: Three-year review].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacteriological profile of burn wounds in patients hospitalized in the burn unit of the Military Hospital in Rabat and describe their sensitivity to antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted from July, 2009, through March, 2011, in the hospital bacteriology laboratory, in collaboration with the burn unit. At each admission, a questionnaire was completed to collect the patient's data. Bacteriological samples were collected from burn wounds at admission and every time the bandage was changed. Identification of bacteria was based on their culture, morphological, and biochemical characteristics. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined with the agar diffusion method, in accordance with the recommendations of the French Society of Microbiology. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Version 13 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) software. RESULTS: The study included 58 burn patients. Their mean age was 38.2 +/- 15.5 years; the mortality rate was 13.8%, and the prevalence of infection 43.1%. We identified 126 non-redundant bacterial strains from the 112 samples collected, most often Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus spp. CONCLUSION: Heightened vigilance and rigorous application of hygiene rules, together with continuous epidemiological surveillance of burn wound bacteria, are essential to optimize empiric antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Evolution of antimicrobial resistance in Gram negative bacilli from intensive care units in Colombia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The continuous evolution of antimicrobial resistance poses a major  threat to public health worldwide. Molecular biology techniques have been integrated to epidemiological surveillance systems to improve the control strategies of this phenomenon. OBJECTIVE: To describe the phenotypic and molecular profiles of the most important Gram negative bacilli from intensive care units in 23 Colombian hospitals during the study period 2009-2012. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted in 23 hospitals belonging to the Colombian Nosocomial Resistance Study Group. A total of 38.048 bacterial isolates were analyzed using WHONET over a four-year period. The antimicrobial resistant profiles were described for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii . Polymerase chain reaction was performed in 1.248 strains to detect the most clinically relevant carbapenemases. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated organism (mean=14.8%). Frequency of K. pneumoniae increased significantly from 11% in 2009 to 15% in 2012 (p<0.001). All screened isolates had rising trends of multidrug-resistant profiles. KPC ( Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase) was detected in 68.4% of K. pneumoniae isolates while VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-betalactamase) was present in 46.5% of them. CONCLUSION: In this study, an increase in the trend of multidrug-resistant organisms and a wide distribution of carbapenemases was observed. The integration of molecular biology to surveillance systems allowed the compilation of this data, which will aid in the construction of guidelines on antimicrobial stewardship for prevention in Colombia.
TI  - Impact of appropriate antimicrobial treatment on transition from ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis to ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Two small randomized controlled trials have suggested beneficial effects of antibiotic treatment in patients with ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT). The primary aim of this study is to determine the impact of appropriate antibiotic treatment on transition from VAT to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in critically ill patients. The secondary objective was to determine the incidence of VAP in patients with VAT. METHODS: This was a prospective observational multicenter study. All patients with a first episode of VAT were eligible. Patients with tracheostomy at intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and those with VAP prior to VAT were excluded. VAT was defined using all the following criteria: fever > 38 degrees C with no other cause, purulent tracheal secretions, positive tracheal aspirate (>/= 10(5) cfu/mL), and absence of new infiltrate on chest X ray. Only VAP episodes diagnosed during the 96 h following VAT, and caused by the same bacteria, were taken into account. Antibiotic treatment was at the discretion of attending physicians. Risk factors for transition from VAT to VAP were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis. All variables from univariate analysis with P values <0.1 were incorporated in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred and ten patients were screened for this study. Eighty-six, and 123 patients were excluded for tracheostomy at ICU admission, and VAP prior to VAT; respectively. One hundred and twenty two (7.1%) patients were included. 17 (13.9%) patients developed a subsequent VAP. The most common microorganisms in VAT patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30%), Staphylococcus aureus (18%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (10%). Seventy-four (60%) patients received antimicrobial treatment, including 58 (47.5%) patients who received appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Appropriate antibiotic treatment was the only factor independently associated with reduced risk for transition from VAT to VAP (OR [95% CI] 0.12[0.02-0.59], P = 0.009). The number of patients with VAT needed to treat to prevent one episode of VAP, or one episode of VAP related to P. aeruginosa was 5, and 34; respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate antibiotic treatment is independently associated with reduced risk for transition from VAT to VAP.
TI  - Infective endocarditis due to multidrug resistant gram-negative bacilli: single centre experience over 5 years.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) due to gram-negative (GN) bacilli is uncommon. Although multi- and extensively-drug resistant (MDR/XDR) GN infections are emerging, very few data are available on IE due to these microrganisms. METHODS: In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics, course and outcome of five contemporary, definite, MDR/XDR GNIE cases seen at our centre. RESULTS: All patients had been admitted to a hospital during the 6months before IE onset, 2 were on hemodialysis and 3 on intravenous medications. Three of the 5 cases were hospital-acquired. Intracardiac prosthetic devices were present in all cases (3 central venous lines, 2 prosthetic heart valves, 2 pacemakers). Mean Charlson comorbidity index was 5.8. Causative pathogens were XDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 cases), XDR Acinetobacter baumannii, MDR Burkolderia cepacia and MDR Escherichia coli (1 case each). Concomitant pathogens with a MDR/XDR phenotype were isolated in 4 patients. Both valves and intracardiac devices and left and right sides of the heart were involved. The rate of complications was high. Antibiotic treatment hinged on the use of colistin, a carbapenem or both. Cardiovascular surgical procedures were performed in 3 patients. Despite aggressive therapeutic regimens, outcomes were poor. Clearance of bacteremia was obtained in 3 patients, in-hospital death occurred in 3 patients, only 1 patient survived during follow up. CONCLUSIONS: MDR/XDR GN are emerging as a cause of IE in carriers of intracardiac prostheses with extensive healthcare contacts and multiple comorbidities. Resistant GNIE has a complicated course and shows a dismal prognosis.
TI  - Genome Sequences of Two Carbapenemase-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 Isolates.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae, an ESKAPE group (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogen, has acquired multiple antibiotic resistance genes and is becoming a serious public health threat. Here, we report the genome sequences of two representative strains of K. pneumoniae from the emerging K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) outbreak in northeast Ohio belonging to sequence type 258 (ST258) (isolates Kb140 and Kb677, which were isolated from blood and urine, respectively). Both isolates harbor a blaKPC gene, and strain Kb140 carries blaKPC-2, while Kb677 carries blaKPC-3.
TI  - Bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of ENT infections in a tropical hospital.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective observational study to determine the spectrum and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of organisms isolated in otorhinolaryngologic (ORL) infections. We reviewed the laboratory culture and sensitivity records of 4,909 patients-2,773 males (56.5%) and 2,136 females (43.5%), aged 2 to 90 years (mean: 45.3 +/- 12.6)-who had been seen at two government hospitals in Malaysia. Of this group, 4,332 patients had a respiratory tract infection (88.2%), 206 had an ear infection (4.2%), 188 had a deep neck infection (3.8%), and 183 had an oropharyngeal infection (3.7%). The most common isolated organisms were Klebsiella spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S aureus, coagulase-negative S aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii. We also identified the antimicrobial susceptibility of these organisms. We conclude that since the spectrum of causative pathogens in some infections differs between tropical and nontropical areas of the world, tropical hospitals should not completely adopt the antibiotic guidelines for ORL infections that have been recommended for hospitals in nontropical regions. We hope that our review and analysis of local data will help practitioners in Malaysia develop an appropriate prescribing policy with respect to ORL pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility. The goal is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with these infections.
TI  - Persistence of nosocomial bacteria on 2 biocidal fabrics based on silver under conditions of high relative humidity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The survival of pathogenic microorganism on fabrics in the health care environment has a important role in nosocomial infections. The use of biocidal fabrics and surfaces could reduce the prevalence of the microorganisms in the hospital environment. METHODS: In this study, the persistence of nosocomial bacteria on 2 fabrics containing biocidal fibers (BF) in the long term following desiccation and subsequent storage was examined at 40% and 90% relative humidity (RH). RESULTS: Very few strains survived more than 7 days at 40% RH on fabrics containing 67% BF, and only strains of Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa survived on fabric containing 100% BF. None of the strains tested survived 14 days on the 2 fabrics, 67% or 100% BF, under these environmental conditions. In contrast, at higher RH ( approximately 90%), most of the strains tested showed prolonged survival on both fabrics, and all strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and A baumannii survived for more than 14 days; however, in a Petri dish, most of the microorganisms tested showed a higher survival even at 28 days. The gram-positive cocci and A baumannii were the most persistent bacteria on the Petri dish. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the effect of RH on the survival of nosocomial bacteria on 2 commercially available fabrics containing biocide. Evidence of the clinical efficacy of these BF-containing fabrics is lacking.
TI  - Free-living amoebae: what part do they play in healthcare-associated infections?
AB  - Free-living amoebae (FLA) are ubiquitous protozoa that do not require a host organism for survival. They are found in natural environments such as water or soil, and man-made environments including tap water or swimming pools, where they may interact with other micro-organisms, including bacteria, fungi and viruses. FLA can harbour micro-organisms including those found in hospital water systems, offering them protection against hostile conditions, providing a vehicle of dissemination, and enabling them to prepare for subsequent survival in macrophages. The interaction between Legionella pneumophila and FLA has been studied extensively; subsequent investigations have shown that FLA may serve as a reservoir for other bacteria including mycobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, or even fungi and viruses. Amoebae found in hospital water systems can serve as a reservoir of potential pathogens and thus be indirectly related to healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in Vietnam: report from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART 2009-2011).
AB  - Treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. Limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from Vietnam. This study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in Vietnam during 2009-2011. A total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends. Antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods. Among the species collected, Escherichia coli (48.1% ESBL-positive) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% ESBL-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. Ertapenem MIC90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/mL and remained unchanged for ESBL-positive isolates. Imipenem MIC90 values were also the same for all isolates and ESBL-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/mL, respectively. Ertapenem MIC90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/mL, respectively. Analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that CTX-M variants, particularly CTX-M-27 and CTX-M-15, were the predominant enzymes. High resistance rates in Vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout Asia and globally.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates recovered from a tertiary care hospital in Al Qassim, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergences of antimicrobial-resistances have become an important  issue in global healthcares. Limitations in surveying hinder the actual estimates of resistance in many countries. THE AIM: the present study was designed to retrospectically survey antimicrobial susceptibility for resistance profiling of dominant pathogens in a tertiary-care center in Buraidah, Saudi Arabia from January-2011 to December-2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the design was cross-sectional and spanned records of a 1000 bacterial non-related isolates. Antibiograms were based on the 2012 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, were the most resistant. All isolates of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were resistant to penicillin (100%), and oxacillin with 52%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. Interestingly, an increasing trend of resistance-pattern was seen for the three species against gentamicin 26%, 50%, 68% ciprofloxacin 22%, 50%, 68%, tetracycline 30%, 44%, 27%, erythromycin 26%, 64%, 73%, and clindamycin 20%, 47%, 50% suggesting potential between-species transfer of resistances. Acinetobacter baumannii was resistances to all antibiotics tested including ciprofloxacin (90%), ceftazidime (89%), cefepime (67%), Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66%), amikacin (63%), gentamicin (51%), tetracycline (43%), piperacillin-tazobactam (42%), and imipenem (9%). A similar pattern was seen by P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, a typical pattern of resistance in K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms was observed. CONCLUSION: we have shown staphylococci, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric bacteria were the most resistant species in this region.
TI  - Pyocyanin stimulates quorum sensing-mediated tolerance to oxidative stress and increases persister cell populations in Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are nosocomial pathogens with  overlapping sites of infection. This work reports that the two can coexist stably in mixed-culture biofilms. In a study intended to improve our understanding of the mechanism of their coexistence, it was found that pyocyanin, produced by P. aeruginosa that generally eliminates competition from other pathogens, led to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A. baumannii cells, which in response showed a significant (P </= 0.05) increase in production of enzymes, specifically, catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD). This work shows for the first time that the expression of catalase and SOD is under the control of a quorum-sensing system in A. baumannii. In support of this observation, a quorum-sensing mutant of A. baumannii (abaI::Km) was found to be sensitive to pyocyanin compared to its wild type and showed significantly (P </= 0.001) lower levels of the antioxidant enzymes, which increased on addition of 5 muM N-(3-hydroxydodecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone. Likewise, in wild-type A. baumannii, there was a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in the level of anti-oxidant enzymes in the presence of salicylic acid, a known quencher of quorum sensing. In the presence of amikacin and carbenicillin, A. baumannii formed 0.07 and 0.02% persister cells, which increased 4- and 3-fold, respectively, in the presence of pyocyanin. These findings show that pyocyanin induces a protective mechanism in A. baumannii against oxidative stress and also increases its persistence against antibiotics which could be of clinical significance in the case of coinfections with A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride shows bactericidal advantages over chlorhexidine digluconate against ESKAPE bacteria.
AB  - More information regarding the bactericidal properties of polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (PHMG) against clinically important antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens needs to be provided for its uses in infection control. The bactericidal properties of PHMG and chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG) were compared based on their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum bactericidal concentrations, and time-course-killing curves against clinically important antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE pathogens. Results showed that PHMG exhibited significantly higher bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter spp. than CHG. A slight bactericidal advantage over CHG was obtained against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, ciprofloxacin- and levofloxacin-resistant Acinetobacter spp., and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In previous reports, PHMG had higher antimicrobial activity against almost all tested Gram-negative bacteria and several Gram-positive bacteria than CHG using MIC test. These studies support the further development of covalently bound PHMG in sterile-surface materials and the incorporation of PHMG in novel disinfectant formulas.
TI  - Efficacy of surface disinfectant cleaners against emerging highly resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria is a clinical problem. Surface disinfectant cleaners (SDCs) that are effective against these bacteria are needed for use in high risk areas around patients and on multi-touch surfaces. We determined the efficacy of several SDCs against clinically relevant bacterial species with and without common types of multidrug resistance. METHODS: Bacteria species used were ATCC strains; clinical isolates classified as antibiotic-susceptible; and multi-resistant clinical isolates from Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (all OXA-48 and KPC-2); Acinetobacter baumannii (OXA-23); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (VIM-1); and Achromobacter xylosoxidans (ATCC strain). Experiments were carried out according to EN 13727:2012 in quadruplicate under dirty conditions. The five evaluated SDCs were based on alcohol and an amphoteric substance (AAS), an oxygen-releaser (OR), surface-active substances (SAS), or surface-active-substances plus aldehydes (SASA; two formulations). Bactericidal concentrations of SDCs were determined at two different contact times. Efficacy was defined as a log10 >/= 5 reduction in bacterial cell count. RESULTS: SDCs based on AAS, OR, and SAS were effective against all six species irrespective of the degree of multi-resistance. The SASA formulations were effective against the bacteria irrespective of degree of multi-resistance except for one of the four P. aeruginosa isolates (VIM-1). We found no general correlation between SDC efficacy and degree of antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSIONS: SDCs were generally effective against gram-negative bacteria with and without multidrug resistance. SDCs are therefore suitable for surface disinfection in the immediate proximity of patients. Single bacterial isolates, however, might have reduced susceptibility to selected biocidal agents.
TI  - Prevalence of nosocomial infections and anti-infective therapy in Benin: results  of the first nationwide survey in 2012.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on nosocomial infections in hospitals in low-income countries are scarce and often inconsistent. The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of nosocomial infections and antimicrobial drug use in Benin hospitals. METHODS: All hospitals were invited to participate in the first national point prevalence study conducted between 10-26 October 2012 using the protocol developed by the "Hospitals in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance" (HELICS) project. Infection prevalence rates and the proportion of infected patients and exposure to antimicrobials were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 87% (39/45) of hospitals participated. Of 3130 inpatients surveyed, 972 nosocomial infections were identified among 597 patients, representing an overall prevalence of infected patients of 19.1%. The most frequent infections were related to the urinary tract (48.2%), vascular catheter use (34.7%), and surgical site (24.7%). 64.6% of patients surveyed were treated with antibiotics, including a significant proportion (30%) of non-infected patients and a high proportion of self-medication (40.8%). Resistance of leading nosocomial pathogens to antimicrobials included methicillin-resistance (52.5%) among Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin resistance among enterococci (67.5%), cefotaxime resistance among Escherichia coli (67.6%), and ceftazidime resistance among Acinetobacter baumannii (100%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (68.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Benin has high nosocomial infection rates and calls for the implementation of new national infection control policies. Patient safety education and training of all individuals involved in healthcare delivery will be critical to highlight awareness of the burden of disease. The high use of antimicrobials needs to be addressed, particularly their indiscriminate use in non-infected patients.
TI  - Impact of microbial ecology on accuracy of surveillance cultures to predict multidrug resistant microorganisms causing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess surveillance cultures (SC)  prediction accuracy in two periods and settings of the same Department with a different microbiological epidemiology (high and low prevalence of multi-drug resistant microorganisms (MDRM)). METHODS: Prospective and observational study. SC were obtained twice a week in consecutive mechanically ventilated patients. Patients fulfilling VAP criteria were analyzed. RESULTS: 440 patients were followed up, 71 patients had VAP (50 in period I and 21 in period II). MDRM causing VAP were more prevalent in the first period (48% vs. 19%; p = 0.033). The rate of empirical appropriate treatment in period I was lower than in period II (52% vs.76%; p = 0.031). SC prediction accuracy was similar in the two periods (80% vs. 81%; p = 0.744). However, if antibiotic treatment had been guided by SC, the percentage of appropriate treatment would have increased by 28% in the first period but only by 5% in the second; p = 0.024. CONCLUSIONS: SC were able to predict VAP etiology in 80% of cases regardless the prevalence of MDRM. However, the potential benefit of SC in terms of appropriate empirical treatment could be only observed when MDRM were prevalent.
TI  - Detection of Antiseptic-Resistance Genes in Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. Isolated From Burn Patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC), which contain benzalkonium chloride as the most widely used agent, are employed as wound and skin antiseptics, as well as disinfectants in hospitals. The resistance mechanism to disinfectants is usually determine by genes which are related to resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds, namely, qacE, qacDeltaE1, qacDeltaE1 that are found in Gram-negative bacteria. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of antiseptic resistance genes, qacE and qacDeltaE1, in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter bumanii. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 83 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 5 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii from burn hospitals in Tehran and Isfahan provinces in 2010-2011, were tested by the PCR method. RESULTS: Out of the 83 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 49 isolates (50%) had the qacE gene, and 76 isolates (91.5%) had the qacDeltaE1 gene. In addition, in 5 isolates of Acinetobacter bumanii, 2 isolates (40%) had the qacE gene, and 4 isolates (80%) had the qacDeltaE1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the genes which harbored resistance to quaternary ammonium compound antiseptics are widespread among Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter bumanii isolates in burn patients.
TI  - In vitro design of a novel lytic bacteriophage cocktail with therapeutic potential against organisms causing diabetic foot infections.
AB  - In patients with diabetes mellitus, foot infections pose a significant risk. These are complex infections commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, all of which are potentially susceptible to bacteriophages. Here, we characterized five bacteriophages that we had determined previously to have antimicrobial and wound-healing potential in chronic S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii infections. Morphological and genetic features indicated that the bacteriophages were lytic members of the family Myoviridae or Podoviridae and did not harbour any known bacterial virulence genes. Combinations of the bacteriophages had broad host ranges for the different target bacterial species. The activity of the bacteriophages against planktonic cells revealed effective, early killing at 4 h, followed by bacterial regrowth to pre-treatment levels by 24 h. Using metabolic activity as a measure of cell viability within established biofilms, we found significant cell impairment following bacteriophage exposure. Repeated treatment every 4 h caused a further decrease in cell activity. The greatest effects on both planktonic and biofilm cells occurred at a bacteriophage : bacterium input multiplicity of 10. These studies on both planktonic cells and established biofilms allowed us to better evaluate the effects of a high input multiplicity and a multiple-dose treatment protocol, and the findings support further clinical development of bacteriophage therapy.
TI  - A survey of five broad-host-range plasmids in gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To learn the prevalence of the primary classical broad-host-range (BHR) IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids in dominant gram-negative bacilli from inpatients in a teaching hospital in southern China. METHODS: A multiplex polymerase chain reaction based on the replicons of BHR IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids was developed and used to determine these BHR plasmids. The difference in prevalence rates among the different species from three specimens was evaluated by a binary logistic regression model and the differences between multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) and non-MDRO were assessed using a chi-square test. RESULTS: The average positive detection percentages of the replicons were 4.3%, 3.7%, 3.0%, 2.6%, and 1.9%, respectively, for IncN, IncP, IncQ, IncW, and IncA/C in descending order. The distribution of all five BHR plasmids did not differ significantly between specimens collected from wounds and urine, although both were significantly higher than those of sputum. The prevalence rates of all five BHR plasmids in MDROs were significantly higher than those in non-MDRO for Enterobacteriaceae; however, no significant difference was seen in non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB). CONCLUSIONS: BHR IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids, which occur more often in bacilli from wound and urine specimens than those of sputum, are widespread in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from inpatients. The prevalence rates in MDRO are higher than those in non-MDRO for Enterobacteriaceae but not significantly different for NFGNB.
TI  - Antimicrobial consumption and resistance in five Gram-negative bacterial species  in a hospital from 2003 to 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The misuse of antimicrobial agents increases drug resistance in bacteria. METHODS: The correlation between antimicrobial agent consumption and related resistance in the Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis was analyzed during the period 2003-2011. RESULTS: Among these five bacteria, overall E. coli and K. pneumoniae were more commonly isolated from bloodstream than the other species. Regarding Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae showed annual increases of resistance to the tested antimicrobial agents; conversely, P. mirabilis exhibited reduced resistance to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. In contrast to the relatively low antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii revealed high resistance, which was over 85% resistant rate to the tested antimicrobial agents and over 80% carbapenem resistance in 2011. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis differed in development of antimicrobial resistance after consumption of the antimicrobial agents. K. pneumoniae developed resistance to all antimicrobial groups, whereas resistance in P. mirabilis was not related to any antimicrobial consumption. P. aeruginosa developed resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, whereas A. baumanii developed resistance to carbapenems after their use. CONCLUSION: The development of antimicrobial resistance was related to antimicrobial agents and bacterial species.
TI  - Evaluation of the total MBL confirm kit (ROSCO) for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Phenotypic tests for carbapenemase production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii have been associated with unspecific metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) inhibitor activity in synergy tests and low positive predictive value. In this study, a collection of well-characterized P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates was used to evaluate the inhibitor-based Total MBL Confirm Kit and the MBL Etest.
TI  - Broad-spectrum anti-biofilm peptide that targets a cellular stress response.
AB  - Bacteria form multicellular communities known as biofilms that cause two thirds of all infections and demonstrate a 10 to 1000 fold increase in adaptive resistance to conventional antibiotics. Currently, there are no approved drugs that specifically target bacterial biofilms. Here we identified a potent anti-biofilm peptide 1018 that worked by blocking (p)ppGpp, an important signal in biofilm development. At concentrations that did not affect planktonic growth, peptide treatment completely prevented biofilm formation and led to the eradication of mature biofilms in representative strains of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium and Burkholderia cenocepacia. Low levels of the peptide led to biofilm dispersal, while higher doses triggered biofilm cell death. We hypothesized that the peptide acted to inhibit a common stress response in target species, and that the stringent response, mediating (p)ppGpp synthesis through the enzymes RelA and SpoT, was targeted. Consistent with this, increasing (p)ppGpp synthesis by addition of serine hydroxamate or over-expression of relA led to reduced susceptibility to the peptide. Furthermore, relA and spoT mutations blocking production of (p)ppGpp replicated the effects of the peptide, leading to a reduction of biofilm formation in the four tested target species. Also, eliminating (p)ppGpp expression after two days of biofilm growth by removal of arabinose from a strain expressing relA behind an arabinose-inducible promoter, reciprocated the effect of peptide added at the same time, leading to loss of biofilm. NMR and chromatography studies showed that the peptide acted on cells to cause degradation of (p)ppGpp within 30 minutes, and in vitro directly interacted with ppGpp. We thus propose that 1018 targets (p)ppGpp and marks it for degradation in cells. Targeting (p)ppGpp represents a new approach against biofilm-related drug resistance.
TI  - [Emerging and important antibiotic resistance in Gram negative bacteria: epidemiology, theory and practice].
AB  - Emerging and clinically-relevant antibiotic resistance mechanisms among Gram-negative rods are the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), carbapenemases, and 16S RNA methylases conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. Those resistance determinants do confer multiresistance to antibiotics. They are found in Enterobacteriaceae (especially community-acquired isolates, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). Detection of ESBL-producing and carbapenemase-producing isolates rely on the use of rapid diagnostic techniques that have to be performed when a reduced susceptibility to 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins or to carbapenems is observed, respectively. Only an early detection of those emerging resistance traits may contribute to limit their nosocomial spread and to optimize the antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of THAM Trisphenylguanide against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study investigated the potential antibacterial activity of three series of compounds synthesized from 12 linear and branched polyamines with 2-8 amino groups, which were substituted to produce the corresponding guanides, biguanides, or phenylguanides, against Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Antibacterial activity was measured for each compound by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration against the bacteria, and the toxicity towards mammalian cells was determined. The most effective compound, THAM trisphenylguanide, was studied in time-to-kill and cytoplasmic leakage assays against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, USA300) in comparison to chlorhexidine. Preliminary toxicity and MRSA challenge studies in mice were also conducted on this compound. THAM trisphenylguanide showed significant antibacterial activity (MIC approximately 1 mg/L) and selectivity against MRSA relative to all the other bacteria examined. In time-to-kill assays it showed increased antimicrobial activity against MRSA versus chlorhexidine. It induced leakage of cytoplasmic content at concentrations that did not reduce cell viability, suggesting the mechanism of action may involve membrane disruption. Using an intraperitoneal mouse model of invasive MRSA disease, THAM trisphenylguanide reduced bacterial burden locally and in deeper tissues. This study has identified a novel guanide compound with selective microbicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, including a methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strain.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolated from pediatric patients with nosocomial bloodstream infections in a Mexican tertiary care hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-negative bacilli are the most common bacteria causing nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBSIs) in Latin American countries. METHODS: The antibiotic resistance profiles of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from blood cultures in pediatric patients with NBSIs over a 3-year period in a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Mexico City were determined using the VITEK-2 system. Sixteen antibiotics were tested to ascertain the resistance rate and the minimum inhibitory concentration using the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth micro-dilution method as a reference. RESULTS: A total of 931 isolates were recovered from 847 clinically significant episodes of NBSI. Of these, 477 (51.2%) were caused by Gram-negative bacilli. The most common Gram-negative bacilli found were Klebsiella pneumoniae (30.4%), Escherichia coli (18.9%), Enterobacter cloacae (15.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.9%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (4.6%). More than 45 and 60% of the K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates, respectively, were resistant to cephalosporins, and 64% of the E. coli isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones. A. baumannii exhibited low rates of resistance to antibiotics tested. In the E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa isolates, no rates of resistance higher than 38% were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that the proportion of NBSIs due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in a tertiary care pediatric hospital of Mexico.
TI  - [News of antibiotic resistance among Gram-negative bacilli in Algeria].
AB  - Antibiotic resistance has become a major public health problem in Algeria. Indeed the past decade, we have seen a significant increase in resistance to antibiotics especially in Gram-negative bacilli. Resistance to beta-lactams in enterobacteria is dominated by the production of ESBL CTX-M-3 and CTX-M-15. The strains producing these enzymes are often the cause of potentially serious infections in both hospital and community settings. Identified plasmid cephalosporinases are CMY-2, CMY-12 and DHA-1. The isolation of strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa producing carbapenemases is rare in Algeria. Some Enterobacteriaceae producing OXA-48 or VIM-19 have been reported; so far, only VIM-2 has been identified in P. aeruginosa. However, the situation regarding the strains of Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to carbapenemases seems to be more disturbing. The carbapenemase OXA-23 is the most common and seems to be endemic in the north. The carbapenemase NDM-1 has also been identified. Resistance to aminoglycosides is marked by the identification armA gene associated with blaCTX-M genes in strains of Salmonella sp. Several other resistance genes have been identified sporadically in strains of Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Resistance genes to fluoroquinolones are more recent identification in Algeria. The most common are the Qnr determinants followed by the bifunctional enzyme AAC[6']-Ib-cr. Resistance to sulfonamides and trimethoprim was also reported in Enterobacteriaceae strains in the west of the country.
TI  - Emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in clinical isolates of  Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Henan, China.
AB  - A total of 216 clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from a general hospital in Henan, China, and screened for the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants. The presence of beta-lactamase genes and mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions were investigated among the PMQR-positive isolates.
TI  - Paenibacterin, a novel broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic, neutralises endotoxins and promotes survival in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis.
AB  - Paenibacterin, produced by Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus OSY-SE, is active both against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Paenibacterin showed relatively low cytotoxicity against a human kidney cell line (ATCC CRL-2190), with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)>/=109mug/mL. The cationic paenibacterin molecule binds to the negatively charged Gram-negative endotoxins in vitro, suggesting that paenibacterin can neutralise lipopolysaccharides. In a murine septic shock model, two 500mug doses of paenibacterin significantly increased the survival of mice challenged with a lethal level of P. aeruginosa. Considering that paenibacterin is effective against many strains of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, this study suggests that this antimicrobial agent is a promising candidate as a new drug.
TI  - In vitro activity of the siderophore monosulfactam BAL30072 against contemporary  Gram-negative pathogens from New York City, including multidrug-resistant isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAL30072 was assessed against clinical isolates from NYC hospitals, including isolates from a citywide surveillance study and a collection of isolates with well-characterised resistance mechanisms. BAL30072 was the most active beta-lactam against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50/90, 0.25/1 mug/mL), Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC50/90, 4/>64 mug/mL) and KPC-possessing Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC50/90, 4/>64 mug/mL). Combining BAL30072 with meropenem resulted in a >/= 4-fold decrease in the BAL30072 MIC90 both for A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae. For isolates with a BAL30072 MIC>4 mug/mL, addition of a sub-MIC concentration of colistin resulted in a four-fold decrease in the BAL30072 MIC in 44% of P. aeruginosa, 82% of A. baumannii and 23% of K. pneumoniae. Using sub-MIC concentrations, BAL30072 plus colistin was bactericidal against 4 of 11 isolates in time-kill studies. BAL30072 MICs were frequently lower for P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae when tested using Mueller-Hinton agar versus Iso-Sensitest agar or Mueller-Hinton broth. Against the well-characterised isolates, reduced susceptibility to BAL30072 correlated with mexA and mexX expression (P. aeruginosa), adeB expression (A. baumannii) and presence of SHV-type ESBLs (A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae). BAL30072 shows promising activity against contemporary Gram-negatives, including MDR P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae. Enhanced activity was often present when BAL30072 was combined with meropenem or colistin. BAL30072 MICs were influenced by the testing method, particularly for P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. Further in vivo studies are warranted to determine the potential clinical utility of BAL30072 alone and combined with other agents.
TI  - Eliciting antibiotics active against the ESKAPE pathogens in a collection of actinomycetes isolated from mountain soils.
AB  - The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens poses a major threat for human health. In recent years, genome sequencing has unveiled many poorly expressed antibiotic clusters in actinomycetes. Here, we report a well-defined ecological collection of >800 actinomycetes obtained from sites in the Himalaya and Qinling mountains, and we used these in a concept study to see how efficiently antibiotics can be elicited against MDR pathogens isolated recently from the clinic. Using 40 different growth conditions, 96 actinomycetes were identified - predominantly Streptomyces - that produced antibiotics with efficacy against the MDR clinical isolates referred to as ESKAPE pathogens: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Enterobacter cloacae. Antimicrobial activities that fluctuated strongly with growth conditions were correlated with specific compounds, including borrelidin, resistomycin, carbomethoxy-phenazine, and 6,7,8- and 5,6,8-trimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarin, of which the latter was not described previously. Our work provided insights into the potential of actinomycetes as producers of drugs with efficacy against clinical isolates that have emerged recently and also underlined the importance of targeting a specific pathogen.
TI  - Epidemiology of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria in adult hospitalized patients at Siriraj Hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics, risk factors, outcomes, antibiotic treatment and complications of hospitalized patients infected with multi-drug resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacteria in Siriraj Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A cross sectional study was performed in all hospitalized patients at Siriraj Hospital who had positive culture for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii during February to May 2012. Clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of MDR gram-negative bacteria were analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of overall MDR gram-negative bacteria was 48.8%. The percentage of MDR organism was 37.8% for Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobactericeae, 39.3% for carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and 88.7% for MDR A. baumannii. Infections caused by MDR organisms were associated with admission to medical wards, respiratory tract origin and hospital onset of infection. The significant risk factor of overall MDR organism infection was previous antibiotic use within 1 year (adjusted odd ratio 6.818, 95% CI = 1.337-34.770). Rate of inappropriate antibiotic use was 56.7% for initial empirical regimen and under treatment was significantly higher in MDR group. The 30-day and 90-day survival rates of MDR group were significant lower than non-MDR group (58.8% vs. 75.0%, p = 0.013 at 30th day and 43% vs. 63%, p = 0.012 at 90th day). Antibiotic associated adverse effect found 42.9% in MDR group and 20.0% in non-MDR group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The strongest risk factor for acquiring MDR gram-negative infection was previous antibiotic use. Inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment was common in patients infected with MDR pathogens, resulting in unfavorable outcome and mortality.
TI  - Mixed-species biofilm compromises wound healing by disrupting epidermal barrier function.
AB  - In chronic wounds, biofilm infects host tissue for extended periods of time. This work establishes the first chronic preclinical model of wound biofilm infection aimed at addressing the long-term host response. Although biofilm-infected wounds did not show marked differences in wound closure, the repaired skin demonstrated compromised barrier function. This observation is clinically significant, because it leads to the notion that even if a biofilm infected wound is closed, as observed visually, it may be complicated by the presence of failed skin, which is likely to be infected and/or further complicated postclosure. Study of the underlying mechanisms recognized for the first time biofilm-inducible miR-146a and miR-106b in the host skin wound-edge tissue. These miRs silenced ZO-1 and ZO-2 to compromise tight junction function, resulting in leaky skin as measured by transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Intervention strategies aimed at inhibiting biofilm-inducible miRNAs may be productive in restoring the barrier function of host skin.
TI  - Clinical significance of surveillance culture in liver transplant recipients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Routine microbiologic surveillance is a method of infection control,  but its clinical significance in transplant recipients is not known. We analyzed microbiologic data to evaluate the influence of cultured microorganisms between the point of surveillance and infectious episodes in liver transplant recipients. METHODS: We performed surveillance culture for sputum and peritoneal fluid in liver transplant recipients from January 2009 to December 2011, at the time of transplantation (T1), 5 days (T2), and 10 days (T3) postoperatively. RESULTS: Of the 179 recipients, 32.9% had a positive sputum culture result and 37.4% had a positive peritoneal culture result during surveillance. In the culture surveillance of sputum, 37 organisms were isolated from 35 recipients at T1, and the most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus (n = 13). At T2, 45 organisms were isolated from 39 recipients, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), S aureus (n = 8), and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 6). At T3, 18 organisms were isolated from 15 patients, including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5) and K pneumonia (n = 4). In the peritoneal fluid, 11 organisms were isolated from 10 recipients at T1, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2) and Enterococcus species (n = 2). At T2, 39 organisms were isolated from 36 recipients, including coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (CNS; n = 8) and Enterococcus species (n = 7). At T3, 54 organisms were isolated from 51 recipients, including CNS (n = 17) and Candida species (n = 8). Among the 59 patients with positive culture results for sputum surveillance, 16.9% developed pneumonia caused by the same organisms. Among the 67 patients with positive peritoneal fluid culture, 16.4% developed an intra-abdominal infection caused by the same organisms cultured. The recipients with positive surveillance culture had a higher risk of pneumonia (20.3% [12/59] vs 1.6% [2/120]; P < .001) and intra-abdominal infection (31.3% [21/67] vs 18.7% [21/112]; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Periodic microbiologic surveillance may be useful in the prediction of post-transplantation pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection and could offer a potential target for empirical antimicrobial therapy in cases of infection.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens: current and emerging therapeutic approaches.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the era of multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and even pandrug-resistant Gram-negative microorganisms, the medical community is facing the threat of untreatable infections particularly those caused by carbapenemase-producing bacteria, that is, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Therefore, all the presently available antibiotics, as well as for the near future compounds, are presented and discussed. AREAS COVERED: Current knowledge concerning mechanisms of action, in vitro activity and interactions, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy and toxicity issues for revived and novel antimicrobial agents overcoming current resistance mechanisms, including colistin, tigecycline, fosfomycin, temocillin, carbapenems, and antibiotics still under development for the near future such as plazomicin, eravacycline and carbapenemase inhibitors is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Colistin is active in vitro and effective in vivo against XDR carbapenemase-producing microorganisms in the critically ill host, whereas tigecycline, with the exception of P. aeruginosa, has a similar spectrum of activity. The efficacy of combination therapy in bacteremias and ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae carbapenemase producers seems to be obligatory, whereas in cases of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii its efficacy is questionable. Fosfomycin, which is active against P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae, although promising, shares poor experience in XDR infections. The in vivo validity of the newer potent compounds still necessitates the evaluation of Phase III clinical trials particularly in XDR infections.
TI  - Potentiation effects of amikacin and fosfomycin against selected amikacin-nonsusceptible Gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The amikacin-fosfomycin inhalation system (AFIS) is a combination of 2 antibiotics and an in-line nebulizer delivery system that is being developed for adjunctive treatment of pneumonia caused by Gram-negative organisms in patients on mechanical ventilation. AFIS consists of a combination of amikacin and fosfomycin solutions at a 5:2 ratio (amikacin, 3 ml at 100 mg/ml; fosfomycin, 3 ml at 40 mg/ml) and the PARI Investigational eFlow Inline System. In this antibiotic potentiation study, the antimicrobial activities of amikacin and fosfomycin, alone and in a 5:2 combination, were assessed against 62 Gram-negative pathogens from a worldwide antimicrobial surveillance collection (SENTRY). The amikacin MICs for 62 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were >/=32 mug/ml (intermediate or resistant according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI]; resistant according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing [EUCAST]). Each isolate was tested against amikacin (0.25 to 1,024 mug/ml), fosfomycin (0.1 to 409.6 mug/ml), and amikacin-fosfomycin (at a 5:2 ratio) using CLSI reference agar dilution methods. The median MIC values for amikacin and fosfomycin against the 62 isolates each decreased 2-fold with the amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) combination from that with either antibiotic alone. Interactions between amikacin and fosfomycin differed by isolate and ranged from no detectable interaction to high potentiation. The amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) combination reduced the amikacin concentration required to inhibit all 62 isolates from >1,024 to </= 256 mug/ml and reduced the required fosfomycin concentration from 204.8 to 102.4 mug/ml. These results support continued development of the amikacin-fosfomycin combination for aerosolized administration, where high drug levels can be achieved.
TI  - Micro-patterned surfaces reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro: Potential for enhancing endotracheal tube designs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a leading hospital acquired  infection in intensive care units despite improved patient care practices and advancements in endotracheal tube (ETT) designs. The ETT provides a conduit for bacterial access to the lower respiratory tract and a substratum for biofilm formation, both of which lead to VAP. A novel microscopic ordered surface topography, the Sharklet micro-pattern, has been shown to decrease surface attachment of numerous microorganisms, and may provide an alternative strategy for VAP prevention if included on the surface of an ETT. To evaluate the feasibility of this micro-pattern for this application, the microbial range of performance was investigated in addition to biofilm studies with and without a mucin-rich medium to simulate the tracheal environment in vitro. METHODS: The top five pathogens associated with ETT-related pneumonia, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli, were evaluated for attachment to micro-patterned and un-patterned silicone surfaces in a short-term colonization assay. Two key pathogens, MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were evaluated for biofilm formation in a nutrient rich broth for four days and minimal media for 24 hours, respectively, on each surface type. P. aeruginosa was further evaluated for biofilm formation on each surface type in a mucin-modified medium mimicking tracheal mucosal secretions. Results are reported as percent reductions and significance is based on t-tests and ANOVA models of log reductions. All experiments were replicated at least three times. RESULTS: Micro-patterned surfaces demonstrated reductions in microbial colonization for a broad range of species, with up to 99.9% (p < 0.05) reduction compared to un-patterned controls. Biofilm formation was also reduced, with 67% (p = 0.12) and 52% (p = 0.05) reductions in MRSA and P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, respectively. Further, a 58% (p < 0.01) reduction was demonstrated on micro-patterned surfaces for P. aeruginosa biofilms under clinically-simulated conditions when compared to un-patterned controls. CONCLUSIONS: This engineered micro-pattern reduces the colonization and biofilm formation of key VAP-associated pathogens in vitro. Future application of this micro-pattern on endotracheal tubes may prevent or prolong the onset of VAP without the need for antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria in patients with suspected  sepsis by multiplex PCR.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumanii have been found to be the most prevalent bacteremia-causing bacteria in patients with septicemia. Early detection of bloodstream infection (BSI) is crucial in the clinical setting. A multiplex PCR method for identification of these agents in clinical samples has been developed in parallel by conventional microbiological methods. METHODOLOGY: The target genes selected for each of the organisms were very specific for designing primers. Design of primers was done using Mega4, Allel ID6, Oligo6, and Oligo analyzer software. The test comprises a universal PCR from the 16S rDNA gene and multiplex PCR from the rpoB, gyrA, sss, and chromosome X (as an internal control). RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity for universal PCR and multiplex PCR in comparison with BC were 83.87% and 91.58%, and 74.19% and 91.58%, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) for these two PCRs were 76.47% and 94.57%, and 74.19% and 91.58%, respectively. PCR failed to identify bacteria which were found conventionally in only 3.96% and 6.34% of the cases by universal and multiplex PCR (mostly bacteria not included in the PCR cassette). In 6.34% of the cases, multiplex PCR afforded identification of bacteria, but BC showed no bacteria in the sample. CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex PCR approach facilitates the detection of bacteremia in blood samples within a few hours. Rapid detection of bacteria by multiplex PCR appears to be a valuable tool, allowing earlier pathogen-adopted antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients.
TI  - [Analysis of drug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and use of antibiotics in  burn wards during 6 years].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution characteristics of pathogens, the drug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), and the use of antibiotics against Gram negative bacilli (GNB) in burn wards, so as to provide a guide for future treatment. METHODS: A total of 2 758 strains of pathogens were isolated from specimens of wound excretion, venous catheter attachment, blood, stool, urine, and sputum from 7 441 patients hospitalized in our burn wards from January 2007 to December 2012. After being identified by API strips and automatic microorganism identification and drug sensitivity analyzer, drug resistance of all the pathogens to 13 antibiotics commonly used in clinic, including amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, etc., was tested by K-B paper disk diffusion method. The defined daily doses per 1 000 patient-day of 5 antibiotics including amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin each year was set as use intensity. The WHONET 5.6 software was used to analyze the distribution of pathogens and the drug resistance of PA to 13 antibiotics. The SPSS 19.0 software was used to analyze the relation between changes in drug-resistant rates of PA to 13 antibiotics and year, the relation between the proportion of PA in all the pathogens and the use intensity of 5 antibiotics commonly used against GNB, and the relation between the use intensity of ciprofloxacin and the change in drug-resistant rates of PA to amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and imipenem with Pearson correlation analysis. RESULTS: (1) In 6 years, Staphylococcus aureus ranked the first with the highest proportion (31%, 865/2 758). The proportion of PA increased to tie in with Acinetobacter baumannii (both accounting for 17%, 458/2 758), both taking the second place. (2) Drug-resistant rates of PA to amikacin, gentamicin, aztreonam, piperacillin, cefoperazone, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem, and meropenem were significantly increased and positively correlated with year (with r values from 0.844 to 0.988, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), while the drug-resistant rate of PA to ciprofloxacin was decreased and negatively correlated with year (r = -0.836, P < 0.05). (3) In 6 years, the use intensity of amikacin (from 8.65 to 91.44), cefoperazone/sulbactam (from 9.62 to 63.56), imipenem (from 7.63 to 157.25), ceftazidime (from 18.39 to 86.11), and ciprofloxacin (from 0 to 19.77) was increased. (4) The proportion of PA in all the pathogens was positively correlated with the use intensity of imipenem and ciprofloxacin (with r values respectively 0.849, 0.933, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), while it was not significantly correlated with the use intensity of amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, or ceftazidime (with r values respectively 0.672, 0.668, 0.794, P values all above 0.05). (5) The use intensity of ciprofloxacin was positively correlated with the drug-resistant rates of PA to amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and imipenem (with r values respectively 0.878, 0.934, 0.928, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In our burn wards, drug-resistant PA was prevalent, with positive correlation with the use intensity of antibiotics. The sensitive rate can be increased by a decrease in the use of amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and imipenem periodically.
TI  - "Specificity Determinants" Improve Therapeutic Indices of Two Antimicrobial Peptides Piscidin 1 and Dermaseptin S4 Against the Gram-negative Pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A new class of antimicrobial agents with lower rates of resistance and different  targets is urgently needed because of the rapidly increasing resistance to classical antibiotics. Amphipathic cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent such a class of compounds. In our previous studies, using a 26-residue de novo designed antimicrobial peptide, we proposed the concept of "specificity determinant(s)": positively charged residue(s) in the center of the non-polar face of AMPs that could decrease hemolytic activity/toxicity but increase or maintain the same level of antimicrobial activity to increase dramatically the therapeutic index. In the current study, we used d-enantiomers of two AMPs, Piscidin 1 isolated from fish and dermaseptin S4 isolated from frog. We substituted different positions in the center of the hydrophobic face with one or two lysine residue(s) (one or two "specificity determinant(s)"). This simple modification not only maintained or improved antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii (11 strains) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6 strains), but also dramatically decreased hemolytic activity of human red blood cells, as predicted. Therapeutic indices improved by 55-fold and 730-fold for piscidin 1 (I9K) and dermaseptin S4 (L7K, A14K), respectively, against A. baumannii. Similarly, the therapeutic indices improved 32-fold and 980-fold for piscidin 1 (I9K) and dermaseptin S4 (L7K, A14K), respectively, against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative pathogens in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacteria is a worldwide problem, including in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with major concerns regarding Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacteriaceae. Although over half of the isolates of P. aeruginosa remain susceptible to carbapenems, quinolones, and aminoglycosides in most reports from Saudi Arabia, resistance is on increase, with a worrying high prevalence of multidrug resistance. Ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and aminoglycosides remain active against A. baumannii isolates in some studies from the Kingdom, but recent data suggest increased resistance. Carbapenems are now the treatment of choice for Acinetobacter infections but their activity too is being eroded. Among Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp. are the most clinically relevant species. Rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production by these species vary among studies but are generally high in Saudi Arabia, with many ESBL-producing isolates multiresistant to other agents, except carbapenems and nitrofurantoin. A similar pattern is seen for Klebsiella, although with more resistance to quinolones, aminoglycosides, and to nitrofurantoin than in E. coli. Enterobacter is commonly resistant to penicillins, monobactams, and cephalosporins but mostly susceptible to carbapenems. Carbapenemases are beginning to emerge in Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro colistin susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and  Acinetobacter baumannii strains at a tertiary care centre in Western Turkey.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria are an important issue in intensive care units worldwide. Colistin, one of the earliest polymyxin antibiotics, was once widely used for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. However, its use is now limited due to concerns over nephrotoxicity. The appearance of multidrug-resistant species, including A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, has led to the re-emergence of this class of drugs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates to colistin and other antibiotics. The antimicrobial susceptibility of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates to colistin and other antibiotics was evaluated between January 2011 and October 2012 at Tepecik Education and Research Hospital in Izmir, Turkey. Clinical isolates were identified using an automatized Vitek 2.0 system. Colistin susceptibility was measured by E-test; the susceptibility profiles of other antibiotics were evaluated using the Kirby Bauer disk-diffusion method. A total of 149 isolates were included in the study, consisting of 98 A. baumannii and 51 P. aeruginosa isolates. The MICs of colistin against A. baumannii were 0.125-2.0 mcg/mL, and 0.25-2.0 mcg/mL against P. aeruginosa; all multidrug-resistant strains examined in this study were susceptible to colistin. Recently, colistin has re-emerged as an effective treatment for infections due to multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. All isolates examined in this study were susceptible to colistin, suggesting it could be a viable alternative for the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant strains.
TI  - Value of American Thoracic Society guidelines in predicting infection or colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms in critically ill patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence rate of infection by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) can affect the accuracy of etiological diagnosis when using American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. We determined the accuracy of the ATS guidelines in predicting infection or colonization by MDROs over 18 months at a single ICU in eastern China. METHODS: This prospective observational study examined consecutive patients who were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in Nanjing, China. MDROs were defined as bacteria that were resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii. Screening for MDROs was performed at ICU admission and discharge. Risk factors for infection or colonization with MDROs were recorded, and the accuracy of the ATS guidelines in predicting infection or colonization with MDROs was documented. RESULTS: There were 610 patients, 225 (37%) of whom were colonized or infected with MDROs at ICU admission, and this increased to 311 (51%) at discharge. At admission, the sensitivity (70.0%), specificity (31.6%), positive predictive value (38.2%), and negative predictive value (63.5%), all based on ATS guidelines for infection or colonization with MDROs were low. The negative predictive value was greater in patients from departments with MDRO infection rates of 31-40% than in patients from departments with MDRO infection rates of 30% or less and from departments with MDRO infection rates more than 40%. CONCLUSION: ATS criteria were not reliable in predicting infection or colonization with MDROs in our ICU. The negative predictive value was greater in patients from departments with intermediate rates of MDRO infection than in patients from departments with low or high rates of MDRO infection. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01667991.
TI  - Next science wound gel technology, a novel agent that inhibits biofilm development by gram-positive and gram-negative wound pathogens.
AB  - Loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with  various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. Such wounds then become chronically infected. Topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of Next Science wound gel technology (NxtSc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. In vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that NxtSc inhibited biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. The gel formulation NxtSc-G5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 CFU/disc or CFU/g. In vivo, NxtSc-G5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. Storage of NxtSc-G5 at room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. These results establish that NxtSc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. This novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life, shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.
TI  - A PROspective study on the Usage patterns of Doripenem in the Asia-Pacific region (PROUD study).
AB  - Doripenem is approved in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region for treating nosocomial pneumonia (NP) including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) and complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs). Clinical usage of doripenem (500mg intravenously, infused over 1h or 4h every 8h for 5-14 days) in APAC was evaluated in a prospective, open-label, non-comparative, multicentre study of inpatients (>/=18 years) with NP, VAP, cIAI or cUTI. A total of 216 [intention-to-treat (ITT)] patients received doripenem: 53 NP (24.5%); 77 VAP (35.6%); 67 cIAI (31.0%); and 19 cUTI (8.8%). Doripenem MIC90 values for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 32, 32, 0.094 and 0.64mug/mL, respectively. Doripenem was used most commonly as monotherapy (86.6%) and as second-line therapy (62.0%). The clinical cure rate in clinically evaluable patients was 86.7% at the end of therapy (EOT) and 87.1% at test of cure (TOC) (7-14 days after EOT). In the ITT population, overall clinical cure rates were 66.2% at EOT and 56.5% at TOC. The median duration of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay and mechanical ventilation was 20, 12 and 10 days, respectively. Of 146 discharged patients, 7 were re-admitted within 28 days of EOT; 1 VAP patient was re-admitted to the ICU. The all-cause mortality rate was 22.7% (49/216). The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (1.4%) and vomiting (1.4%). Doripenem is a viable option for treating APAC patients with NP, VAP, cIAI or cUTI. [ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT 00986102].
TI  - Probing the penetration of antimicrobial polymyxin lipopeptides into gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The dry antibiotic development pipeline coupled with the emergence of multidrug resistant Gram-negative 'superbugs' has driven the revival of the polymyxin lipopeptide antibiotics. Polymyxin resistance implies a total lack of antibiotics for the treatment of life-threatening infections. The lack of molecular imaging probes that possess native polymyxin-like antibacterial activity is a barrier to understanding the resistance mechanisms and the development of a new generation of polymyxin lipopeptides. Here we report the regioselective modification of the polymyxin B core scaffold at the N-terminus with the dansyl fluorophore to generate an active probe that mimics polymyxin B pharmacologically. Time-lapse laser scanning confocal microscopy imaging of the penetration of probe (1) into Gram-negative bacterial cells revealed that the probe initially accumulates in the outer membrane and subsequently penetrates into the inner membrane and finally the cytoplasm. The implementation of this polymyxin-mimetic probe will advance the development of platforms for the discovery of novel polymyxin lipopeptides with efficacy against polymyxin-resistant strains.
TI  - Prevalence and risk factors for antibiotic-resistant community-associated bloodstream infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance is increasing in many community settings. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of antibiotic resistant community-associated bloodstream infections (CA-BSIs) present on hospital admissions to identify risk factors for acquiring resistant versus susceptible CA-BSIs and to describe the incidence of concurrent infections with CA-BSIs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from one community, one pediatric, and two tertiary/quaternary care hospitals within an academically affiliated network in the borough of Manhattan in New York, NY, from 2006 to 2008. The CA-BSIs present at hospital admission were defined as BSIs occurring within the first 48h of hospitalization. Infections and patient characteristics were identified using data available from patients' electronic medical records and discharge records. RESULTS: In total, 1677 CA-BSIs were identified. Staphylococcus aureus had the largest proportion of resistance (41.2%), followed by enterococcal species (24.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.2%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.6%), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.9%). Significant predictors of resistance were prior residence in a skilled nursing facility (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.39-4.70), advanced age (1.01; 1.002-1.02), presence of malignancy (0.58; 0.37-0.91), prior hospitalization (1.62; 1.17-2.23), a weighted Charlson score (1.09; 1.02-1.17) for S. aureus, presence of malignancy (1.82; 1.004-3.30), prior hospitalizations (2.03; 1.12-3.38) for enterococcal species, and younger age for S. pneumoniae (p=0.02). Urinary tract infections were the most common concurrent infection (n=45/87, 51.7%). CONCLUSION: Over 27% of the CA-BSIs present on admission were antibiotic resistant. Understanding the prevalence and risk factors for CA-BSIs may help improve empiric antibiotic therapy and outcomes for patients with community-onset infections.
TI  - Epidemiology and antibiotic resistance in a large Italian teaching hospital.
AB  - We focused our attention on susceptibility profile of Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Klebsiella spp. isolated from biological specimens at the University Hospital of Salerno between June 2011 and October 2012. Acinetobacter, with a prevalence of Acinetobacter baumannii (97%) presented a high range of resistance to the antimicrobials considered, excluding colistin (COL). Klebsiella spp. isolates, with a prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae (90%), presented a variable pattern of resistance [from 9.8% for COL to 50% for levofloxacin (LEV)]. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases production was detected in 15% of isolates. Most Pseudomonas isolates were P. aeruginosa with a high rate of resistance (95% to amoxicillin/clavulanate and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and <50% to the other antibiotics). Colistin remained the most effective drug tested. This study provided useful information of the local bacterial epidemiology hopefully permitting to establish a more effective empirical therapy, preventing the inappropriate use of antibacterial agents and possibly limiting the diffusion of antibacterial resistance.
TI  - Bacteriological study of neonatal sepsis and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of isolates in Kathmandu, Nepal.
AB  - Bloodstream infections in neonates are life-threatening emergencies. Identification of the common bacteria causing such infections and their susceptibility patterns will provide necessary information for timely intervention. This study was done to determine the prevalence of neonatal septicaemia, identify the bacterial isolates and study their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Nepal Medical College Teaching Hospital (NMCTH), Kathmandu, Nepal. This descriptive-analytical study was conducted in NMCTH from July 2011 to January 2012. Blood culture of all neonates who were suspected for neonatal sepsis was performed. Bacterial isolation, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were done by standard microbiological method. Out of 120 neonates suspected of having neonatal sepsis, 30.8% (37/120) were blood culture positive (i.e. prevalence = 30.8%). The most common causative agents of neonatal sepsis was Staphylococcus aureus (56.8%; 21/37) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (21.7%; 8/37), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.4%; 5/37) and others. Neonatal sepsis was more frequent in male neonates (32.5%) while (26.5%) in female neonates in the ratio of 1.2:1 (p > 0.05). Neonatal sepsis was significantly higher (58.3%) in low birth weight (LBW) (< 2.5kg) neonates compared with good birth weight (GBW) (23.9%) (< 0.05). Prevalence was higher in preterm neonates (57.8%; 11/19) as compared with term-babies (25.7%) (P = 0.05). Generally, all of the isolates were sensitive to most of the antibiotics used as the first line drugs like amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and ampicillin except Acinetobacter baumannii. This organisms was only sensitive towards cotrimoxazole, azithromicin, cefotaxime and ceftazidime.
TI  - Ceftazidime/avibactam activity tested against Gram-negative bacteria isolated from bloodstream, pneumonia, intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections in US medical centres (2012).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The activity of ceftazidime/avibactam and comparator agents was monitored at 73 medical centres across all nine US census bureau regions during 2012. METHODS: Bacterial isolates were collected from patients hospitalized with pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTI), intra-abdominal infections (IAI) and bloodstream infections (BSI). The study protocol predetermined the target numbers of strains for each of the requested bacterial species that sites were to collect. Isolates were determined to be clinically relevant at the medical centre and only one isolate per patient episode was collected. RESULTS: There were 1466 Gram-negative isolates from BSI, 3245 from pneumonia patients, 501 from IAI and 2356 from UTI. Ceftazidime/avibactam was active against Enterobacteriaceae from each infection type. The MIC90 values for ceftazidime/avibactam against Enterobacteriaceae isolates from BSI, pneumonia patients, IAI or UTI were 0.25 mg/L. The extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance rates for Escherichia coli were 8.5% (UTI), 10.4% (IAI), 12.7% (BSI) and 17.5% (pneumonia patients). The extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance rates for Klebsiella spp. were 13.0% (UTI), 13.9% (BSI), 16.3% (IAI) and 19.3% (pneumonia patients). A total of 96.5% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from BSI, 95.8% from pneumonia patients, 96.3% from IAI and 98.7% from UTI exhibited a ceftazidime/avibactam MIC of </=8 mg/L (CLSI susceptible breakpoint for ceftazidime when tested alone against P. aeruginosa). Most tested agents showed limited activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, except for colistin. A total of 31.2% of A. baumannii displayed ceftazidime/avibactam MIC values of </=8 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftazidime/avibactam demonstrated potent broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative pathogens collected in the USA during 2012 from BSI, pneumonia patients, IAI and UTI.
TI  - Drug resistance analysis of bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the spectrum and drug resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients to provide a reference for rational clinical use of antibiotics. Up to 1914 bacterial strain specimens isolated from burn patients admitted to hospital between 2001 and 2010 were subjected to resistance monitoring by using the K-B paper disk method. Retrospective analysis was performed on drug resistance analysis of burn patients. The top eight bacterium strains according to detection rate. A total of 1355 strains of Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria and 559 strains of Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria were detected. The top eight bacterium strains, according to detection rate, were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus. Drug resistance rates were higher than 90% in A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus, which accounted for 52.2, 21.7, 27.8, and 33.3%, respectively, of the entire sample. Those with drug resistance rates lower than 30% accounted for 4.3, 30.4, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively. Multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) accounted for 49.2 and 76.4% of the S. epidermis and S. aureus resistance, respectively. Antibacterial drugs that had drug resistance rates to MRSE and MRSA higher than 90% accounted for 38.9 and 72.2%, respectively, whereas those with lower than 30% drug resistance rates accounted for 11.1 and 16.7%, respectively. The burn patients enrolled in the study were mainly infected with G(-) bacteria. These results strongly suggest that clinicians should practice rational use of antibiotics based on drug susceptibility test results.
TI  - Repurposing of gallium-based drugs for antibacterial therapy.
AB  - While the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is vanishing current anti-infective therapies, the antibiotic discovery pipeline is drying up. In the last years, the repurposing of existing drugs for new clinical applications has become a major research area in drug discovery, also in the field of anti-infectives. This review discusses the potential of repurposing previously approved gallium formulations in antibacterial chemotherapy. Gallium has no proven function in biological systems, but it can act as an iron-mimetic in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The activity of gallium mostly relies on its ability to replace iron in redox enzymes, thus impairing their function and ultimately hampering cell growth. Cancer cells and bacteria are preferential gallium targets due to their active metabolism and fast growth. The wealth of knowledge on the pharmacological properties of gallium has opened the door to the repurposing of gallium-based drugs for the treatment of infections sustained by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens, such as Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for suppression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth. The promising antibacterial activity of gallium both in vitro and in different animal models of infection raises the hope that gallium will confirm its efficacy in clinical trials, and will become a valuable therapeutic option to cure otherwise untreatable bacterial infections.
TI  - In vitro activity and in vivo animal model efficacy of IB-367 alone and in combination with imipenem and colistin against Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of IB-367 and its bactericidal effect for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, associated to a synergic study to test the antibiotic combinations between the peptide and colistin or imipenem. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), the synergy test and killing study were carried out to evaluate the IB-367 activity. In the in vivo model, a wound was incised through the panniculus carnosus of BALB/c mice, and then inoculated with 5 x 107 colony-forming units of P. aeruginosa and E. coli. For each strain, the study included an infected or not infected group that did not receive any treatment, and five contaminated groups treated with local IB- 367, intraperitoneal imipenem, intraperitoneal colistin, topical IB-367 local plus intraperitoneal imipenem or intraperitoneal colistin. All isolates were inhibited by IB-367 at concentrations of 4-64 mg/l. Killing by IB-367 was shown to be very rapid: its activity on all Gram-negative bacteria was completed within a 40 min exposure period at a concentration of 2 x MIC/l. Synergy was demonstrated when IB-367 was combined with colistin or imipenem. In in vivo studies, the groups treated with topical IB-367 and intraperitoneal colistin showed the best results in terms of bacterial load inhibition either for Pseudomonas or for E. coli. The good in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy, as well as, the synergic interactions with antibiotics suggest that IB-367 is a promising candidate for potential application in the treatment of wound Gram-negative infections.
TI  - In Vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 Indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: Bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests by the Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. The antibacterial potentiality of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of nine uropathogens. RESULTS: Two Gram-positive isolates, E. faecalis and S. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. Gram-negative isolates A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. Methanolic leaf extracts of Anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against S. aureus and 28 mm against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for E. faecalis, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: C. tora > A. acuminata > Schleichera oleosa > Pterocarpus santalinus > Eugenia jambolana > Bridelia retusa > Mimusops elengi > Stereospermum kunthianum > Tectona grandis > Anthocephalus cadamba. The following eight plants had moderate control capacity: Artocarpus heterophyllus, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia latifolia, Eucalyptus citriodora, Gmelina arborea, Pongamia pinnata, Pterocarpus marsupium, and Shorea robusta. E. coli, followed by A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. Phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against MDR uropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Photodynamic inactivation of multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospital wastewaters: influence of residual antibiotics.
AB  - One environmental concern related to hospital effluents is discharge of them without preliminary treatment. Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) may represent an alternative to the traditional expensive, unsafe and not always effective disinfection methods. The main goal of this work was to assess the efficiency of PDI on clinical multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in hospital wastewaters in order to evaluate its potential use in treating hospital effluents. The efficiency of PDI was assessed using a cationic porphyrin as the photosensitizer (PS), four MDR bacteria either in phosphate buffered saline or in filtrated hospital wastewaters. The synergistic effect of PDI and antibiotics (ampicillin and chloramphenicol) was also evaluated, as well as the effect of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The results show the efficient inactivation of MDR bacteria in PBS (reduction of 6-8 log after 270 min of irradiation at 40 W m(-2) with 5.0 muM of PS). In wastewater, the inactivation of the four MDR bacteria was again efficient and the decrease in bacterial survival starts even sooner. A faster decrease in bacterial survival occurred when PDI was combined with the addition of antibiotics, at sub-inhibitory and inhibitory concentrations, but the SDS did not affect the PDI efficiency. It can be concluded that PDI has potential to be an effective alternative for the inactivation of MDR bacteria in hospital wastewaters and that the presence of antibiotics may enhance its effectiveness.
TI  - [Carriage of class 1 and 2 integrons in Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from clinical specimens and a novel gene cassette array: blaOXA-11-cmlA7].
AB  - The dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria leads to serious problems in the treatment of infectious diseases. It has been shown that resistance genes can also be carried by the integrons. There are limited studies regarding the carriage of class 1 and 2 integrons in Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains in Turkey. The aims of this study were to investigate the carriage rates of class 1 and class 2 integrons in A.baumannii and P.aeruginosa strains isolated from clinical samples in Abant Izzet Baysal University Hospital, and to characterize the antibiotic resistance gene cassettes in these integrons by sequence analyses. A total of 137 strains (77 A.baumannii and 60 P.aeruginosa) isolated from various clinical specimens (56% were sputum, 19% wound, 11% urine, 11% blood, 3% catheter), between March 2010-December 2012, were included in the study. The identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests of the isolates were performed by Vitek 2 Compact (bioMerieux, France) and BD Phoenix 100 (Becton Dickinson, USA) systems. The presence of integrons were screened by PCR method using specific primer pairs targeting class 1 (intI1) and 2 (intI2) integrase regions. All the samples that revealed integron amplification were subjected to DNA sequence analysis, both in the forms of cloned products and PCR amplicons. In the study, the highest susceptibility rates were found against colistin (96%) and tigecycline (78%) in A.baumannii, and against piperacillin/tazobactam (97%) and piperacillin (93%) in P.aeruginosa isolates. The highest resistance rate was determined for piperacillin/tazobactam (95%) in A.baumannii strains. The presence of intI1 gene was detected in 33% (26/77) of A.baumannii and 10% (6/60) of P.aeruginosa isolates. When variable regions in intI1 positive strains were amplified by PCR, eight (8/77, 10%) A.baumannii and three (3/60, 5%) P.aeruginosa strains were found to harbor antibiotic resistance gene cassettes. IntI2 gene was not detected in any of the isolates. Resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, ceftriaxone and ampicillin/sulbactam was detected as the common resistance pattern in all integron-positive A.baumannii strains, whereas resistance to ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin was the common pattern in all integron-positive P.aeruginosa strains. DNA sequence analysis of variable regions of integrons indicated that two separate gene cassette arrays (aacC1-aadA1 and aac(3)-1) were carried by A.baumannii strains, and two types of gene cassette arrays (blaOXA-30-aadA1 and blaOXA-11-cmlA7) were carried by P.aeruginosa strains. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of the gene sequence of blaOXA-11-cmlA7 defined in an integron gene cassette of P.aeruginosa.
TI  - Identification and methionine analog tolerance of environmental bacterial isolates selected on methionine analog containing medium.
AB  - Methionine is the first limiting amino acid in poultry feed. Currently, methionine supplement is synthesized from an expensive chemical process requiring hazardous chemicals. Therefore, the objectives of this study were isolation of methionine producing bacteria from environmental samples and quantification of methionine production in these isolated bacteria. MCGC medium was selected as the isolation medium for methionine-producing bacteria by using Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13032 and Escherichia coli ATCC23798 as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Thirty-nine bacterial strains were obtained from environmental samples. Only strains A121, A122, A151 and A181 were able to tolerate up to 0.1% (w/v) of ethionine or norleucine. These isolated strains were identified by sequencing small subunit rRNA genes. The results revealed that bacterial strains A121, A122, A151and A181 were Klebsiella species, Acinetobacter baumannii, A. baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. When methionine production in strains A121 and A181 was quantitated, strains A121 and A181 generated methionine up to 31.1 and 124.6 mug/ml, respectively.
TI  - Treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections in children.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in conjunction with the erosion of the drug development pipeline may lead us into a bleak future, a "post-antibiotic era." Because of a shortage of studies addressing treatment options for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative (MDRGN) infections in children, data must be extrapolated from the adult literature. However, even adult studies are limited by significant methodological flaws. We are in urgent need of pediatric specific pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data for agents with activity against MDRGN infections as well as improved clinical outcomes studies. For the time being, we must rely on in vitro studies, observational data, and clinical experience to guide our therapeutic decisions. In this review, we discuss treatment considerations for infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms, AmpC beta-lactamase-producing organisms, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in the pediatric population.
TI  - Bugs, hosts and ICU environment: countering pan-resistance in nosocomial microbiota and treating bacterial infections in the critical care setting.
AB  - ICUs are areas where resistance problems are the largest, and these constitute a  major problem for the intensivist's clinical practice. Main resistance phenotypes among nosocomial microbiota are (i) vancomycin-resistance/heteroresistance and tolerance in grampositives (MRSA, enterococci) and (ii) efflux pumps/enzymatic resistance mechanisms (ESBLs, AmpC, metallo-betalactamases) in gramnegatives. These phenotypes are found at different rates in pathogens causing respiratory (nosocomial pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia), bloodstream (primary bacteremia/catheter-associated bacteremia), urinary, intraabdominal and surgical wound infections and endocarditis in the ICU. New antibiotics are available to overcome non-susceptibility in grampositives; however, accumulation of resistance traits in gramnegatives has led to multidrug resistance, a worrisome problem nowadays. This article reviews microorganism/infection risk factors for multidrug resistance, suggesting adequate empirical treatments. Drugs, patient and environmental factors all play a role in the decision to prescribe/recommend antibiotic regimens in the specific ICU patient, implying that intensivists should be familiar with available drugs, environmental epidemiology and patient factors.
TI  - 16S rDNA-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. We sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe AE-COPD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe AE-COPD. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences and cDNA libraries. We used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial 16S rDNA sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. RESULTS: Analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. Species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16S rDNA sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16S rDNA indicated lower levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe AE-COPD.
TI  - [One-year surveillance study of antimicrobial resistance in major bacteria except for MRSA isolated in eight medical facilities in Kumamoto prefecture].
AB  - To investigate the current status of drug-resistant bacteria (except MRSA) in Kumamoto prefecture, a study was conducted to determine the isolation numbers and ratios of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-Escherichia coli, ESBL-Klebsiella species, ESBL-Proteus mirabilis, two-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, (resistant to two drugs either carbapenems, quinolones and aminoglycosides) multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and vancomyacin-resistant Enterococcii in eight general hospitals from May in 2009 to April in 2010. ESBL-E. coli was mostly isolated, and two-drug resistant P. aeruginosa came second. The isolation ratio of overall drug-resistant bacteria did not increase, while the isolation ratio of two-drugs resistant P. aeruginosa declined, suggesting that infection control was successfully conducted in these hospitals. However, the isolation numbers of ESBL-Klebsiella spp. and two-drug resistant P. aeruginosa were variable in each hospital. Furthermore, drug-resistant bacteria were occasionally spread into another medical facilities by patients transferred from these hospitals, indicating that sharing information on drug-resistant bacteria between medical facilities is required.
TI  - Signature motifs identify an Acinetobacter Cif virulence factor with epoxide hydrolase activity.
AB  - Endocytic recycling of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is blocked by the CFTR inhibitory factor (Cif). Originally discovered in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cif is a secreted epoxide hydrolase that is transcriptionally regulated by CifR, an epoxide-sensitive repressor. In this report, we investigate a homologous protein found in strains of the emerging nosocomial pathogens Acinetobacter nosocomialis and Acinetobacter baumannii ("aCif"). Like Cif, aCif is an epoxide hydrolase that carries an N-terminal secretion signal and can be purified from culture supernatants. When applied directly to polarized airway epithelial cells, mature aCif triggers a reduction in CFTR abundance at the apical membrane. Biochemical and crystallographic studies reveal a dimeric assembly with a stereochemically conserved active site, confirming our motif-based identification of candidate Cif-like pathogenic EH sequences. Furthermore, cif expression is transcriptionally repressed by a CifR homolog ("aCifR") and is induced in the presence of epoxides. Overall, this Acinetobacter protein recapitulates the essential attributes of the Pseudomonas Cif system and thus may facilitate airway colonization in nosocomial lung infections.
TI  - Class D beta-lactamases: are they all carbapenemases?
AB  - Carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D beta-lactamases (CHDLs) are enzymes of the utmost  clinical importance due to their ability to produce resistance to carbapenems, the antibiotics of last resort for the treatment of various life-threatening infections. The vast majority of these enzymes have been identified in Acinetobacter spp., notably in Acinetobacter baumannii. The OXA-2 and OXA-10 enzymes predominantly occur in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and are currently classified as narrow-spectrum class D beta-lactamases. Here we demonstrate that when OXA-2 and OXA-10 are expressed in Escherichia coli strain JM83, they produce a narrow-spectrum antibiotic resistance pattern. When the enzymes are expressed in A. baumannii ATCC 17978, however, they behave as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and confer resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. Kinetic studies of OXA-2 and OXA-10 with four carbapenems have demonstrated that their catalytic efficiencies with these antibiotics are in the same range as those of some recognized class D carbapenemases. These results are in disagreement with the classification of the OXA-2 and OXA-10 enzymes as narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases, and they suggest that other class D enzymes that are currently regarded as noncarbapenemases may in fact be CHDLs.
TI  - Risk factors for hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in critically ill patients: a multicenter study in Korea.
AB  - We performed a case-control study to identify risk factors of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB) as an increasing cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The study included critically ill adult patients with HAP whose microbial etiology was identified at eight tertiary centers in Korea between June 2008 and December 2009. Eighty two patients with 86 isolates of CRGNB (62 Acinetobacter baumannii, 14 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 10 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were included in the case group, and 122 patients with carbapenem-susceptible Gram-negative bacteria were included in the control group. Diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.82, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.25-6.38), radiologic score >/=5 (aOR 4.56, 95% CI 2.36-8.81), prior fluoroquinolone (aOR 2.39. 95% CI = 1.07-5.35), or carbapenem usage (aOR 2.82, 95% CI 1.75-17.83) were found to be independent risk factors. Fluoroquinolone and carbapenem should be cautiously used to avoid HAP caused by CRGNB.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia due to carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in an intensive care unit without carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae or epidemic Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CR-GNB) have rarely been evaluated in intensive care units (ICU) without epidemic carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii or Enterobacteriaceae. We addressed this issue in a cohort of 141 patients (previous antimicrobial exposure, n = 131) with a first episode of VAP in a medico-surgical ICU. Twenty-six VAP (18.4%) involved a CR-GNB (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, n = 14, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, n = 11, and A. baumannii, n = 1), without previous carbapenem exposure in 12 (46.1%) cases. GNB resistant to all beta-lactams except carbapenems were equally isolated in CR-GNB VAP (co-infections, 23%) and other episodes (30%). Previous exposure to aminoglycosides (odds ratio (OR) 1.14 per day, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.30, p = 0.02) and the number of antimicrobial classes used before VAP (OR 1.38 per class, 95% CI 1.10-1.73, p = 0.006) were the only independent predictors of CR-GNB. These results suggest that the empirical use of a carbapenem-colistin combination should be evaluated in late-onset VAP following broad-spectrum antimicrobial exposure.
TI  - Antibiofilm and antimicrobial efficacy of DispersinB(R)-KSL-W peptide-based wound gel against chronic wound infection associated bacteria.
AB  - The medical importance of bacterial biofilms has increased with the recognition of biofilms as one of the major contributors to the slow or non-healing chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. Being a protected community of microorganisms, biofilms are notoriously refractory to antibiotic treatments. As the conventional treatment modalities have proven ineffective, this study provides the in vitro evidence to support the use of a novel combination of DispersinB((R)) antibiofilm enzyme that inhibits biofilm formation and disperses preformed biofilm, and thus making the biofilm bacteria more susceptible to a broad-spectrum KSL-W antimicrobial peptide. The combination of DispersinB((R)) and KSL-W peptide showed synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against chronic wound infection associated biofilm-embedded bacteria such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS), and Acinetobacter baumannii. In addition, the wound gel formulation comprising DispersinB((R)), KSL-W peptide, and a gelling agent Pluronic F-127 showed a broad-spectrum and enduring antimicrobial activity against test organisms. Furthermore, as compared to commercial wound gel Silver-Sept, DispersinB((R))-KSL-W peptide-based wound gel was significantly more effective in inhibiting the biofilm-embedded MRSA, S. epidermidis, CoNS, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, A. baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.05). Thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential application of antibiofilm-antimicrobial DispersinB((R))-KSL-W wound gel in chronic wound management.
TI  - Risk factors for acute kidney injury in patients treated with polymyxin B or colistin methanesulfonate sodium.
AB  - Polymyxin B (PMB) and colistin, administered as the prodrug colistin methanesulfonate sodium (CMS), are increasingly used to treat carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Nephrotoxicity is the major dose-limiting adverse effect of both polymyxins. A retrospective cohort study of 132 patients was conducted to evaluate risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI), classified according to Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria, in patients treated with >/=48h of intravenous PMB or CMS, with particular focus on potential differences between each polymyxin. The overall incidence of AKI was 25.8% (34/132) [20.8% (20/96) and 38.9% (14/36) in patients treated with PMB and CMS, respectively; P=0.06]. In the Cox regression model, doses >/=2million International Units (MIU) of PMB or >9MIU of CMS were the only variable independently associated with AKI [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)=2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-4.41; P=0.04]. Vancomycin co-administration was strongly associated with AKI, although this was not statistically significant (aHR=2.22, 95% CI 0.98-5.04; P=0.058). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of AKI between patients treated with PMB or CMS in the multivariate model (aHR=1.74, 95% CI 0.82-3.69; P=0.15). High dose was the main risk factor for AKI regardless of the polymyxin administered. Vancomycin co-administration likely increases the risk of AKI. Although there was a higher overall incidence of AKI in patients treated with CMS compared with PMB, CMS was not significantly associated with this outcome after adjusting for the above variables.
TI  - antibacTR: dynamic antibacterial-drug-target ranking integrating comparative genomics, structural analysis and experimental annotation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Development of novel antibacterial drugs is both an urgent healthcare necessity and a partially neglected field. The last decades have seen a substantial decrease in the discovery of novel antibiotics, which combined with the recent thrive of multi-drug-resistant pathogens have generated a scenario of general concern. The procedures involved in the discovery and development of novel antibiotics are economically challenging, time consuming and lack any warranty of success. Furthermore, the return-on-investment for an antibacterial drug is usually marginal when compared to other therapeutics, which in part explains the decrease of private investment. RESULTS: In this work we present antibacTR, a computational pipeline designed to aid researchers in the selection of potential drug targets, one of the initial steps in antibacterial-drug discovery. The approach was designed and implemented as part of two publicly funded initiatives aimed at discovering novel antibacterial targets, mechanisms and drugs for a priority list of Gram-negative pathogens: Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. However, at present this list has been extended to cover a total of 74 fully sequenced Gram-negative pathogens. antibacTR is based on sequence comparisons and queries to multiple databases (e.g. gene essentiality, virulence factors) to rank proteins according to their potential as antibacterial targets. The dynamic ranking of potential drug targets can easily be executed, customized and accessed by the user through a web interface which also integrates computational analyses performed in-house and visualizable on-site. These include three-dimensional modeling of protein structures and prediction of active sites among other functionally relevant ligand-binding sites. CONCLUSIONS: Given its versatility and ease-of-use at integrating both experimental annotation and computational analyses, antibacTR may effectively assist microbiologists, medicinal-chemists and other researchers working in the field of antibacterial drug-discovery. The public web-interface for antibacTR is available at 'http://bioinf.uab.cat/antibactr'.
TI  - Human platelet gel supernatant inactivates opportunistic wound pathogens on skin.
AB  - Activation of human platelets produces a gel-like substance referred to as platelet rich plasma or platelet gel. Platelet gel is used clinically to promote wound healing; it also exhibits antimicrobial properties that may aid in the healing of infected wounds. The purpose of this study was to quantify the efficacy of human platelet gel against the opportunistic bacterial wound pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus on skin. These opportunistic pathogens may exhibit extensive antibiotic resistance, necessitating the development of alternative treatment options. The antimicrobial efficacy of platelet gel supernatants was quantified using an in vitro broth dilution assay, an ex vivo inoculated skin assay, and in an in vivo skin decontamination assay. Human platelet gel supernatants were highly bactericidal against A. baumannii and moderately but significantly bactericidal against S. aureus in vitro and in the ex vivo skin model. P. aeruginosa was not inactivated in vitro; a low but significant inactivation level was observed ex vivo. These supernatants were quite effective at inactivating a model organism on skin in vivo. These results suggest application of platelet gel has potential clinical applicability, not only in the acceleration of wound healing, but also against relevant bacteria causing wound infections.
TI  - Propensity for biofilm formation by clinical isolates from urinary tract infections: developing a multifactorial predictive model to improve antibiotherapy.
AB  - A group of biofilm-producing bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infections was evaluated, identifying the main factors contributing to biofilm formation. Among the 156 isolates, 58 (37.2%) were biofilm producers. The bacterial species (P<0.001), together with patient's gender (P = 0.022), were the factors with the highest influence for biofilm production. There was also a strong correlation of catheterization with biofilm formation, despite being less significant (P = 0.070) than species or gender. In fact, some of the bacteria isolated were biofilm producers in all cases. With regard to resistance profile among bacterial isolates, beta-lactam antibiotics presented the highest number of cases/percentages--ampicillin (32/55.2%), cephalothin (30/51.7%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (22/37.9%)--although the carbapenem group still represented a good therapeutic option (2/3.4%). Quinolones (nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors) also showed high resistance percentages. Furthermore, biofilm production clearly increases bacterial resistance. Almost half of the biofilm-producing bacteria showed resistance against at least three different groups of antibiotics. Bacterial resistance is often associated with catheterization. Accordingly, intrinsic (age and gender) and extrinsic (hospital unit, bacterial isolate and catheterization) factors were used to build a predictive model, by evaluating the contribution of each factor to biofilm production. In this way, it is possible to anticipate biofilm occurrence immediately after bacterial identification, allowing selection of a more effective antibiotic (among the susceptibility options suggested by the antibiogram) against biofilm-producing bacteria. This approach reduces the putative bacterial resistance during treatment, and the consequent need to adjust antibiotherapy.
TI  - Dermatological complications after bariatric surgery: report of two cases and review of the literature.
AB  - Bariatric surgery aims at weight reduction of severely obese patients. The Roux-en-Y technique is one of the most common bariatric procedures and is occasionally accompanied by nutrient insufficiencies and metabolic changes. According to the literature, skin architecture and immunity change after bariatric surgery and may lead to inflammation and increased susceptibility to pathogens. Additionally, vitamin and mineral deficiencies frequently develop in these patients and affect the skin's defense mechanisms, possibly contributing to dermatological complications. Knowledge and recognition of skin changes after bariatric surgery make an important asset for the dermatologist and help in the proper treatment of these patients. We report 2 cases of infectious skin lesions where vitamin and trace element deficiencies have possibly contributed to their persistence and resistance to traditional treatments.
TI  - Could chloramphenicol be used against ESKAPE pathogens? A review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
AB  - The widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'ESKAPE' (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acintobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens. Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.
TI  - Heterogeneous persister cells formation in Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Bacterial persistence is a feature that allows susceptible bacteria to survive extreme concentrations of antibiotics and it has been verified in a number of species, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus spp., Mycobacterium spp. However, even though Acinetobacter baumannii is an important nosocomial pathogen, data regarding its persistence phenotype are still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the persistence phenotype in A. baumannii strains, as well as its variation among strains after treatment with polymyxin B and tobramycin. Stationary cultures of 37 polymyxin B-susceptible clinical strains of A. baumannii were analyzed for surviving cells after exposure to 15 microg/mL of polymyxin B for 6 h, by serial dilutions and colony counting. Among these, the 30 tobramycin-susceptible isolates also underwent tobramycin treatment at a concentration of 160 microg/mL and persister cells occurrence was evaluated equally. A high heterogeneity of persister cells formation patterns among isolates was observed. Polymyxin B-treated cultures presented persister cells corresponding from 0.0007% to 10.1% of the initial population and two isolates failed to produce detectable persister cells under this condition. A high variability could also be observed when cells were treated with tobramycin: the persister fraction corresponded to 0.0003%-11.84% of the pre-treatment population. Moreover, no correlation was found between persister subpopulations comparing both antibiotics among isolates, indicating that different mechanisms underlie the internal control of this phenotype. This is the first report of persister cells occurrence in A. baumannii. Our data suggest that distinct factors regulate the tolerance for unrelated antibiotics in this species, contrasting the multi-drug tolerance observed in other species (eg. dormancy-mediated tolerance). Supporting this observation, polymyxin B--an antibiotic that is believed to act on non-dividing cells as well--failed to eradicate persister cells in the majority of the isolates, possibly reflecting a disconnection between persistence and dormancy.
TI  - [Monitoring and antibiotic resistance profile of tracheal aspirate microbiota in  ICU children with severe craniocerebral trauma].
AB  - Nosocomial infections and their rational antibiotic treatment represent a major challenge for the healthcare nowadays. In this context, gramnegative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii and Enterobacteriaceae spp. are etiologically important and characterized by a significant level of antibiotic resistance. To examine dynamics of the respiratory tract colonization by hospital flora, tracheal aspirates obtained at three time points from 69 children with severe craniocerebral trauma during their stay in ICU were analysed. Colonization was observed on the 4th day of the ICU stay with predomination of K. pneumoniae (45%) and A. baumanii (27-37%). P. aeruginosa was detected after the 8th day of the ICU stay with the isolation rate of 33%. Substantial proportions of P. aeruginosa (61%), A. baumanii (78%) and K. pneumoniae (25%) were resistant to carbapenems. In 65 carbapemen resistant isolates, the presence of carbapenemases was examined using PCRs. OXA-48 carbapenemase was detected in 11 out of 14 (78%) K. pneumoniae isolates. Among the A. baumanii isolates, 30/31 (97%) carried OXA-40 and 1/31 (3%) had OXA-23 carbapenemases. None of the examined A. baumanii and K. pneumoniae isolates produced metallo-betalactamases (MBL). In contrast, all 20 carbapenem resistant P. aeruginosa isolates produced a MBL, and in 12 out of 20 (60%) of theme VIM-2 was detected. Thus, gramnegative nosocomial microflora rapidly colonizes ICU patients and has a high level of resistance to antibiotics, including carbapenems.
TI  - A quorum sensing small volatile molecule promotes antibiotic tolerance in bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria can be refractory to antibiotics due to a sub-population of dormant cells, called persisters that are highly tolerant to antibiotic exposure. The low frequency and transience of the antibiotic tolerant "persister" trait has complicated elucidation of the mechanism that controls antibiotic tolerance. In this study, we show that 2' Amino-acetophenone (2-AA), a poorly studied but diagnostically important small, volatile molecule produced by the recalcitrant gram-negative human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, promotes antibiotic tolerance in response to quorum-sensing (QS) signaling. Our results show that 2-AA mediated persister cell accumulation occurs via alteration of the expression of genes involved in the translational capacity of the cell, including almost all ribosomal protein genes and other translation-related factors. That 2-AA promotes persisters formation also in other emerging multi-drug resistant pathogens, including the non 2-AA producer Acinetobacter baumannii implies that 2-AA may play an important role in the ability of gram-negative bacteria to tolerate antibiotic treatments in polymicrobial infections. Given that the synthesis, excretion and uptake of QS small molecules is a common hallmark of prokaryotes, together with the fact that the translational machinery is highly conserved, we posit that modulation of the translational capacity of the cell via QS molecules, may be a general, widely distributed mechanism that promotes antibiotic tolerance among prokaryotes.
TI  - Analysis of some common pathogens and their drug resistance to antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the common bacterial resistance of clinical isolates in our hospital in the second half of 2011. METHODOLOGY: Pathogens isolated from clinical samples in the second half of 2011 were analyzed and categorized to perform susceptibility tests. RESULTS: In the gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli accounted for 55.89% and 34.51%. In the gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus, Strptococcus pneumonia accounted for 32.85%, 40.39%, 12.41% and 10.22%, respectively. Other species accounted for 4.14%. Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to cepoperazon, cefepime and imipenem. However,Acinetobacter baumannii was more sensitive to carbapenems antibiotics, which was followed by fourth generation cephalosporins. Klebsiella pneumoniae was extremely sensitive to amikacin, cefepime and imipenem, but was resistant to ampicillin. The detection rates of the broad-spectrum Escherichia coli, Pseudomonasaeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 54.51%, 52.08% and 38.65%. The gram negative bacilli were the prevalent clinical pathogens in our hospital in the second half of 2011. CONCLUSION: The drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria has increased significantly recently, thus the surveillance of antibacterial agents is necessary, and rational use of antibiotic will be urgently needed to reduce the production and dissemination of drug resistant strains.
TI  - In vitro activities of ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam-avibactam against 372  Gram-negative bacilli collected in 2011 and 2012 from 11 teaching hospitals in China.
AB  - Ceftazidime-avibactam, aztreonam-avibactam, and comparators were tested by reference broth microdilution against 372 nonrepetitive Gram-negative bacilli (346 unselected plus 26 selected meropenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates) collected from 11 teaching hospitals in China in 2011 and 2012. Meropenem-nonsusceptible isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs; e.g., CTX-M-14/3), AmpCs (e.g., CMY-2), and/or carbapenemases (e.g., KPC-2 and NDM-1). Avibactam potentiated the activity of ceftazidime against organisms with combinations of ESBLs, AmpCs, and KPC-2. Aztreonam-avibactam was active against all beta-lactamase producers (including producers of NDM-1 and IMP-4/8) except blaOXA-containing Acinetobacter baumannii and some Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates.
TI  - Validation of a novel murine wound model of Acinetobacter baumannii infection.
AB  - Patients recovering from traumatic injuries or surgery often require weeks to months of hospitalization, increasing the risk for wound and surgical site infections caused by ESKAPE pathogens, which include A. baumannii (the ESKAPE pathogens are Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species). As new therapies are being developed to counter A. baumannii infections, animal models are also needed to evaluate potential treatments. Here, we present an excisional, murine wound model in which a diminutive inoculum of a clinically relevant, multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolate can proliferate, form biofilms, and be effectively treated with antibiotics. The model requires a temporary, cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish an infection that can persist. A 6-mm-diameter, full-thickness wound was created in the skin overlying the thoracic spine, and after the wound bed was inoculated, it was covered with a dressing for 7 days. Uninoculated control wounds healed within 13 days, whereas infected, placebo-treated wounds remained unclosed beyond 21 days. Treated and untreated wounds were assessed with multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques that included gross pathology, weight loss and recovery, wound closure, bacterial burden, 16S rRNA community profiling, histopathology, peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy assessment of biofilms. The range of differences that we are able to identify with these measures in antibiotic- versus placebo-treated animals provides a clear window within which novel antimicrobial therapies can be assessed. The model can be used to evaluate antimicrobials for their ability to reduce specific pathogen loads in wounded tissues and clear biofilms. Ultimately, the mouse model approach allows for highly powered studies and serves as an initial multifaceted in vivo assessment prior to testing in larger animals.
TI  - Inhaled colistin for treatment of pneumonia due to colistin-only-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - PURPOSE: Colistin is used for the treatment of pneumonia associated with multidrug- resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the best route of administration and dosage is not known. We report our experience with aerosolized colistin in twelve patients with pneumonia caused by colistin-only-susceptible (COS) A. baumannii. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients' medical records who were treated with aerosolized colistin for the treatment of pneumonia. RESULTS: Ten patients were treated only with aerosolized colistin inhalation and two patients received a 3-day course intravenous colistin, and then switched to colistin inhalation therapy. The median duration of aerosolized colistin therapy was 17 days (5-31 days). Four patients were treated only with aerosolized colistin, whereas 4 patients received concomitant glycopeptides, and 4 received concomitant levofloxacin or cefoperazone/sulbactam. At the end of the therapy, the clinical response rate and bacteriological clearance rate was 83% and 50%, respectively. Colistin-resistant strains were isolated from 3 patients after aerosolized colistin therapy; however, all of them showed favorable clinical response. The median interval between inhalation therapy and resistance was 7 days (range 5-19 days). Acute kidney injury developed in 3 patients. Two patients experienced Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. One patient developed fever and skin rash after aerosolized colistin therapy. No patient developed neurotoxicity or bronchospasm. CONCLUSION: Colistin inhalation therapy is deemed tolerable and safe, and could be beneficial as an adjuctive therapy for the management of pneumonia due to COS A. baumannii. However, the potential development of colistin resistance cannot be overlooked.
TI  - New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii: a novel paradigm for spreading antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  - The impact of carbapenemase production among clinically significant Gram-negative rods is becoming a major medical issue. To date, Acinetobacter baumannii has been considered as a final recipient of carbapenemase genes (imipenemase, Verona metallo-beta-lactamase, Guiana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and Klebsiella pneumonia carbapenemase types) from Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, recent findings regarding the spread of the blaNDM carbapenemase genes revealed that A. baumannii likely acts as a source of emerging antibiotic resistance genes. The analysis of genetic structure surrounding the blaNDM-1 gene revealed that the genetic structure (Tn125) responsible for its dissemination most probably originates from Acinetobacter. Moreover, analysis of the blaNDM-1 gene itself demonstrated that it might be constructed in Acinetobacter through a recombination event with another resistance gene found in A. baumannii (aphA6). This novel paradigm highlights a novel and unexpected role played by A. baumannii.
TI  - Bioactive glass BAG-S53P4 for the adjunctive treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the long bones: an in vitro and prospective clinical study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the in vitro antibacterial activity of the bioglass BAG S53P4 against multi-resistant microorganisms commonly involved in osteomyelitis and to evaluate its use in surgical adjunctive treatment of osteomyelitis. METHODS: In vitro antibacterial activity of BAG-S53P4 against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates was evaluated by means of time kill curves, with colony counts performed after 24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation. In vivo evaluation was performed by prospectively studying a cohort of 27 patients with a clinically and radiologically diagnosed osteomyelitis of the long bones in an observational study. Endpoints were the absence of infection recurrence/persistence at follow-up, no need for further surgery whenever during follow-up and absence of local or systemic side effects connected with the BAG use. RESULTS: In vitro tests regarding the antibacterial activity of BAG S53P4 showed a marked bactericidal activity after 24 hrs against all the tested species. This activity continued in the subsequent 24 hrs and no growth was observed for all strains after 72 hrs. Results of the clinical study evidenced no signs of infection in 24 patients (88.9%) at the follow-up, while 2 subjects showed infection recurrence at 6 months from index operation and one more needed further surgical procedures. BAG-S53P4 was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro and in vivo findings reinforce previous observations on the efficacy of BAG-S53P4 for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the long bones, also in the presence of multi-resistant strains and in immunocompromised hosts, without relevant side effects and without the need for locally adding antibiotics. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Deutschen Register Klinischer Studien (DRKS) unique identifier: DRKS00005332.
TI  - Susceptibility of multiresistant gram-negative bacteria to fosfomycin and performance of different susceptibility testing methods.
AB  - Fosfomycin may be a treatment option for multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria. This study compared susceptibility methods using 94 multiresistant clinical isolates. With agar dilution (AD), susceptibilities were 81%, 7%, 96%, and 100% (CLSI) and 0%, 0%, 96%, and 30% (EUCAST), respectively, for Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp. Categorical agreement between Etest and AD for Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii was >/=80%. Disk diffusion was adequate only for Enterobacter. CLSI criteria for urine may be adequate for systemic infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates collected from the Middle East and Africa between 2004 and 2011.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) was established in 2004 to monitor longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents, specifically tigecycline. In this study, susceptibility among Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates between 2004 and 2011 from the Middle East and Africa was examined. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive criteria, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution methods. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved breakpoints were used for tigecycline. In total, 2967 Gram-positive and 6322 Gram-negative isolates were examined from 33 participating centres. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including meticillin-resistant S. aureus, were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and levofloxacin were highly active (>97.6% susceptibility) against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-non-susceptible strains. All Enterococcus faecium isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid, including 32 vancomycin-resistant isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 16.6% of Escherichia coli and 32.9% of Klebsiella pneumoniae. More than 95% of E. coli and Enterobacter spp. were susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin (88.0% susceptible) and minocycline (64.2% susceptible), respectively; the MIC90 (MIC required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) of tigecycline against A. baumannii was low at 2mg/L. Tigecycline and carbapenem agents were highly active against most Gram-negative pathogens. Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin showed good activity against most Gram-positive pathogens from the Middle East and Africa.
TI  - Nosocomial infection characteristics in a burn intensive care unit: analysis of an eleven-year active surveillance.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to describe nosocomial infection (NI) rates, risk factors, etiologic agents, antibiotic susceptibility, invasive device utilization and invasive device associated infection rates in a burn intensive care unit (ICU) in Turkey. METHODS: Prospective surveillance of nosocomial infections was performed according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) criteria between 2001 and 2012. The data was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During the study period 658 burn patients were admitted to our burn ICU. 469 cases acquired 602 NI for an overall NI rate of 23.1 per 1000 patient days. 109 of all the cases (16.5%) died. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (241), Acinetobacter baumannii (186) and Staphylococcus aureus (69) were the most common identified bacteria in 547 strains. CONCLUSION: Total burn surface area, full thickness burn, older age, presence of inhalation injury were determined to be the significant risk factors for acquisition of NI. Determining the NI profile at a certain burn ICU can lead the medical staff apply the appropriate treatment regimen and limit the drug resistance. Eleven years surveillance report presented here provides a recent data about the risk factors of NI in a Turkish burn ICU.
TI  - Detection of carbapenemase-producing bacteria by using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method.
AB  - The emergence of carbapenemase-producing bacteria poses a new challenge in the management of antibiotic therapies for patients. This report describes a new method using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) for rapid detection of carbapenemase activity in enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. In a panel of 78 isolates, including 41 carbapenemase-producing strains, the ULPC-MS/MS assay showed 100% agreement with molecular characterization, whereas six carbapenemase-producing isolates were not detected by the modified Hodge test.
TI  - Microconductometric immunosensor for label-free and sensitive detection of Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Blood safety is a global health goal. In developed countries, bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates is the highest infectious risk in transfusion despite the current preventive strategies. We aimed to develop a conductometric biosensor for the generic, rapid and sensitive detection of Gram-negative bacteria. Our strategy is based on immunosensors: addressable magnetic nanoparticles coupled with anti-LPS antibodies were used for the generic capture of Gram-negative bacteria. Bacterial capture was characterized by impedancemetric and microscopic measurements. The results obtained with conductometric measurements allowed real-time, sensitive detection of Escherichia coli or Serratia marcescens cultures from 1 to 10(3) CFU mL(-1). The ability of the immunosensor to detect Gram negative bacteria was also tested on clinically relevant strains. The conductometric immunosensor allowed the direct detection of 10-10(3) CFU mL(-1) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains that were undetectable using standard immunoblot methods. Results showed that the conductometric response was not inhibited in 1% serum.
TI  - First detection of OXA-24 carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii isolates in Bulgaria.
AB  - This report describes the first identification of OXA-24 carbapenemase-producing  Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from Bulgaria. According to national surveillance data A. baumannii along with Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most troublesome microorganisms in hospital environment with high rates of acquired carbapenem resistance. In the present study real-time multiplex PCR was performed to identify the most common carbapenemase genes in 15 non-duplicate carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates collected in 2012. The results showed lack of KPC, GES, VIM, IMP-type enzymes. Four A. baumannii isolates tested positive by PCR for the acquired OXA-24 together with the intrinsic OXA-51 carbapenemase. OXA-24 and OXA-23 were determined as co-existent in one isolate. Two isolates were identified with OXA-23 in addition to the OXA-51 carbapenemase.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fibrin sealants containing antimicrobial agents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial prophylaxis is required to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). However, it is difficult to maintain prolonged antimicrobial activity in the surgical incision. Fibrin sealants are used primarily for hemostasis, suture support, or the adhesion of tissues. The aim of this study was to develop fibrin sealants that exhibit antimicrobial activity due to the addition of an antimicrobial agent. METHODS: We determined the potencies and activities of cefazolin, ampicillin-sulbactam, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and arbekacin eluted from fibrin sealants. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP), and multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), which are the major pathogens responsible for hospital-acquired infections. RESULTS: Each antimicrobial agent eluted continuously from the fibrin clots for approximately two weeks. All eluates from fibrin clots containing antimicrobial agents maintained antimicrobial activity against MRSA for at least 7 d. The eluates from fibrin clots containing ampicillin-sulbactam inhibited the growth of both MDRP and MDRAB for at least 5 d. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the addition of an antimicrobial agent to fibrin sealants is a useful method to prevent SSIs caused by bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant strains.
TI  - Clinical experience of colistin-glycopeptide combination in critically ill patients infected with Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A colistin-glycopeptide combination (CGC) has been shown in vitro to be synergistic against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR GNB), especially Acinetobacter baumannii, and to prevent further resistance. However, clinical data are lacking. We carried out a retrospective multicenter study of patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) who received colistin for GNB infection over a 1-year period, to assess the rates of nephrotoxicity and 30-day mortality after treatment onset among patients treated with and without CGC for >/=48 h. Of the 184 patients treated with colistin, GNB infection was documented for 166. The main causative agents were MDR A. baumannii (59.6%), MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.5%); in 16.9% of patients, a Gram-positive bacterium (GPB) coinfection was documented. Overall, 68 patients (40.9%) received CGC. Comparison of patients treated with and without CGC showed significant differences for respiratory failure (39.7% versus 58.2%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (54.4% versus 71.4%), MDR A. baumannii infection (70.6% versus 52%), and GPB coinfection (41.2% versus 0%); there were no differences for nephrotoxicity (11.8% versus 13.3%) and 30-day mortality (33.8% versus 29.6%). Cox analysis performed on patients who survived for >/=5 days after treatment onset showed that the Charlson index (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.44; P = 0.001) and MDR A. baumannii infection (HR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.23 to 5.12; P = 0.01) were independent predictors of 30-day mortality, whereas receiving CGC for >/=5 days was a protective factor (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.93; P = 0.03). We found that CGC was not associated with higher nephrotoxicity and was a protective factor for mortality if administered for >/=5 days.
TI  - Phosphate-containing polyethylene glycol polymers prevent lethal sepsis by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance among highly pathogenic strains of bacteria and fungi is a  growing concern in the face of the ability to sustain life during critical illness with advancing medical interventions. The longer patients remain critically ill, the more likely they are to become colonized by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. The human gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of colonization of many MDR pathogens and is a major source of life-threatening infections due to these microorganisms. Eradication measures to sterilize the gut are difficult if not impossible and carry the risk of further antibiotic resistance. Here, we present a strategy to contain rather than eliminate MDR pathogens by using an agent that interferes with the ability of colonizing pathogens to express virulence in response to host-derived and local environmental factors. The antivirulence agent is a phosphorylated triblock high-molecular-weight polymer (here termed Pi-PEG 15-20) that exploits the known properties of phosphate (Pi) and polyethylene glycol 15-20 (PEG 15-20) to suppress microbial virulence and protect the integrity of the intestinal epithelium. The compound is nonmicrobiocidal and appears to be highly effective when tested both in vitro and in vivo. Structure functional analyses suggest that the hydrophobic bis-aromatic moiety at the polymer center is of particular importance to the biological function of Pi-PEG 15-20, beyond its phosphate content. Animal studies demonstrate that Pi-PEG prevents mortality in mice inoculated with multiple highly virulent pathogenic organisms from hospitalized patients in association with preservation of the core microbiome.
TI  - Emergence of unusual nonfermenting Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens in a Saudi  hospital.
AB  - This study aimed to determine the frequency of isolation and prevalence of drug resistance in nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa and predisposing factors for the acquisition of nosocomial infections caused by these emerging pathogens in a Saudi tertiary care hospital. A total of 125 nonduplicating NFGNB nosocomial strains were isolated, of these, 68 (54.4%) were Acinetobacter baumannii, 26 (20.8%) Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 14 (11.2%) Alcaligenes faecalis, 12 (9.6%) Chryseobacterium indologenes, and 5 (4%) Ralstonia pickettii. MICs of 11 antibiotics were determined using the reference broth microdilution method. With the exception of colistin that inhibited 100% of A. baumannii isolates, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole that inhibited 100% of S. maltophilia isolates, and carbapenems that inhibited 100% of A. faecalis isolates, none of the tested antimicrobial agents inhibited 100% of the other NFGNB spp. Our results emphasize that clinicians and microbiologists should consider A. faecalis, C. indologenes, and R. pickettii as emerging nosocomial pathogens. In addition, local resistance data are essential for helping physicians in deciding an appropriate antibiotic for empirical therapy of infections with these emerging and unusual NFGNB.
TI  - Blood stream infections in patients in the burn intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study on bacteremia helps empirically select the proper antibiotics before the results of culture test about causative pathogen. The purpose of this study is to investigate causative pathogen in bloodstream infection, changing aspects based on elapsed time after burn, relationship with other sites and resistance of important causative pathogen against antibiotics through analysis on bacteria isolated from blood culture of patients hospitalized in burn intensive care unit (BICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted targeting patients hospitalized in BICU from January 2007 to June 2011. Changes of causative pathogen in bloodstream infection based on elapsed time after injury were analyzed. We would like to examine the relationship between bloodstream infection and infection on other body parts by comparing results of cultures in burn wound site, sputum, urine and catheter tip. Antibiotics resistance patterns of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were studied. RESULTS: A total of 2,337 burn patients were hospitalized in BICU for 54 months. Causative pathogen was cultured in blood cultures from 397 patients (17.0%). P. aeruginosa (169, 30.1%) was the most cultured and A. baumannii (107, 19.0%) and S. aureus (81, 14.4%) were followed. It was confirmed that the relative frequency of A. baumannii tended to get lower as the period got longer after injury, but the relative frequency of K. pneumoniae got higher as the period got longer after injury. With comparison without bacteremia, P. aeruginosa bacteremia showed high probability in which the same bacteria were cultured in wound site, sputum and cathether tip, and A. baumannii bacteremia and candida bacteremia had high probability in sputum, and urine and catheter tip, respectively. 95.9% of P. aeruginosa and 95.3% of A. baumannii showed the resistance against carbapenem. 96.3% of S. aureus was methicillin resistant and 36.2% of Enterococcus species were vancomycin resistant. 75.0% of K. pneumonia were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Since the highly antibiotic resistant microorganisms were isolated from the patients hospitalized in BICU during early phase, the empirical selection of antibiotics targeting these pathogens should be considered before the results of microbiologic culture test. In addition, use of empirical antifungal agent after 1 week of injury can be considered for patients who have risk factor of fungal infection.
TI  - [Surveillance of bacterial distribution and drug resistance in inpatients with surgical infections: a single center study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial distribution and drug resistance in patients with surgical infections, and provide the basis for the standardization treatment of the surgical infection. METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed from January 2008 to December 2011 surgical infection in our samples bacteria identification and drug sensitivity test results. RESULTS: A total of 3829 nonduplicate isolates from 3257 samples, Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 62.4% (the main microbes were P.aeruginosa, K. pneumonia and E.coli etc) and Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 37.6% (the main microbes were Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus). Incidence of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were on an obvious increase. For the performance of the high level of sensitive to Imipenem, Amikacin, Piperacillin and Tazobactam by E. coli and K. pneumonia. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii to cephalosporins, Carbapenems and Fluoroqinolones were higher resistant with Multidrug resistance. No vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant Enterococcus faecium were found. The prevalence of ESBL E.coli was 45.6%-61.5% and ESBL K.pneumoniae isolates were fluctuated. The methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) isolates were relatively high (21.1%-55.8%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than the other Gram-positive cocci. Vancomycin for Staphylococcus performance was highly sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The main composition of surgical clinical infection pathogens are Gram-negative bacillus, and the emergency of resistance of bacteria to antibacterial drugs is a common phenomenon. The resistant rate shows ascendant trend; Drug resistance is significantly higher in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious and challenging issue.
TI  - Extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ventriculitis and meningitis treated with intrathecal colistin.
AB  
TI  - Determination by LC-MS/MS of colistins A and B in plasma and ultrafiltrate from critically ill patients undergoing continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colistin is a 50-year-old antibiotic, the use of which was ceased in  the 70s and recently resumed as a "salvage therapy" against multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The narrow therapeutic range of colistin makes the choice of its correct dosage crucial, and monitoring of blood concentration is occasionally necessary for critically ill patients, including intensive care patients subjected to continuous renal replacement therapy. METHODS: Two LC-MS/MS methods were developed and fully validated for the quantitative determination of colistins A and B in plasma and dialysis ultrafiltrate (UF) samples, ultimately arising from 4 patients undergoing continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). RESULTS: The developed methods proved to be both specific and selective. They showed good fit and linearity over the entire range of interest. Trueness and accuracy proved satisfactory. Both methods have excellent intraassay precision (percent coefficient of variations were lower than 10%) and limit of detection values in the range 20-100 ng/mL, about 1-2 orders of magnitude below the concentrations commonly detected in real samples. The mean sieving coefficient (SC) values, measured after 10 minutes of CVVHDF, were 0.42 for colistin A and 0.48 for colistin B. SC values proved to be quite stable for 24 hours, but then declined to 0.24 for colistin A and 0.32 for colistin B, respectively, after 48 hours. At the median blood flow and effluent flow rate of 120 and 28 mL/min, clearance values for colistin B were higher than 15 mL/min. During the entire duration of CVVHDF sessions, the SC and clearance values for colistin A were significantly lower than colistin B. CONCLUSIONS: Two simple methods for the simultaneous determination of colistins A and B have been developed and validated. Their application in the clinical setting demonstrates that CVVHDF treatment lasting 48 hours produces a relatively constant and efficient removal of the drug.
TI  - Epidemiology and outcome of infections with carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria treated with polymyxin B-based combination therapy.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections with carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB) are increasing and are associated with a high mortality. Synergistic effects of combination therapy with a polymyxin, carbapenem, and rifampin have been observed in in vitro studies. Clinical data are limited to retrospective studies. METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study of patients over 18 y of age who were treated with polymyxin B combination therapy. RESULTS: One hundred and four patients were studied. The mean age was 77 y; 73% had recently received antibiotics, 67% had recently been hospitalized, and 47% lived in a nursing facility. The most common infections were pneumonia and urinary tract infection due to Acinetobacter baumannii (33%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%). Treatment regimens included polymyxin B with a carbapenem in 48%, with additional rifampin in 23%. Clinical success was achieved in 50% and reinfection occurred in 25%. Treatment-related acute renal failure occurred in 14.4%. No treatment-related hemodialysis was needed. All-cause hospital mortality was 47% and mortality after 6 months was 77%. No significant difference was found between treatment regimens. Age (odds ratio (OR) 10.4 per 10 y, p = 0.04), severity of acute illness (OR 2.2 per point, p < 0.001), and Charlson score (OR 1.12 per point, p = 0.04) were associated with hospital mortality. K. pneumoniae was associated with increased hospital survival compared to other CRGNB (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: CRGNB infections are associated with previous antibiotic and health care exposure. Mortality is related to age and the severity of chronic and acute illness.
TI  - Prospects for new antibacterials: can we do better?
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibacterial drugs has been increasing relentlessly over the past two decades. This includes common residents of the human body: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin resistant or MRSA) Enteroccus faecalis and E. faecium (vancomycin resistant or VRE): Enterobacteriaceae (multiresistant, carbapenems included or CRE). It also includes environmental, opportunistic, but intrinsically multiresistant species: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Financial considerations have curtailed R&D activity in the antibacterial field in all, but a couple of large pharmaceutical companies and small biotech companies have largely been unable to fill the drug discovery gap. Antibacterials currently under development have targeted, almost exclusively, Gram-positive bacteria; hence, greater effort must be directed against Gram-negative bacteria, particularly enterobacteria. There also has to be more transparency and care in clinical development. To get ahead of the problem of resistance, we must look for first-in-class antibacterials and new targets. The need to innovate is best addressed through partnerships between drug-makers and public institutions. Such partnerships would provide a long-term view and stability to projects, but also balance the interests of corporate and public stakeholders.
TI  - Epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens in cancer patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: Infection due to the six ESKAPE pathogens has recently been identified as a serious emerging problem. However, there is still a lack of information on bacteremia caused by these organisms in cancer patients. We aimed to assess the epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens (rESKAPE) in patients with cancer. METHODS: All episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized adults with cancer from 2006 to 2011 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1,148 episodes of bacteremia, 392 (34 %) were caused by ESKAPE pathogens. Fifty-four episodes (4.7 %) were due to rESKAPE strains (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium 0, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 13, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESLB)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae 7, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii 4, carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18 and derepression chromosomic ss-lactam and ESBL-producing Enterobacter species 12. Risk factors independently associated with rESKAPE bacteremia were comorbidities, prior antibiotic therapy, urinary catheter and urinary tract source. Inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was more frequent in patients with rESKAPE bacteremia than in the other cases (55.6 % vs. 21.5 %, p < 0.001). Persistence of bacteremia (25 % vs. 9.7 %), septic metastasis (8 % vs. 4 %) and early case-fatality rate (23 % vs. 11 %) were more frequent in patients with rESKAPE bacteremia than in patients with other etiologies (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia due to rESKAPE pathogens in cancer patients occurs mainly among those with comorbidities who have received prior antibiotic therapy and have a urinary tract source. These patients often receive inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy and have a poor outcome.
TI  - Prevention of biofilm colonization by Gram-negative bacteria on minocycline-rifampin-impregnated catheters sequentially coated with chlorhexidine.
AB  - Resistant Gram-negative bacteria are increasing central-line-associated bloodstream infection threats. To better combat this, chlorhexidine (CHX) was added to minocycline-rifampin (M/R) catheters. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of CHX-M/R catheters against multidrug resistant, Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was tested. M/R and CHX-silver sulfadiazine (CHX/SS) catheters were used as comparators. The novel CHX-M/R catheters were significantly more effective (P < 0.0001) than CHX/SS or M/R catheters in preventing biofilm colonization and showed better antimicrobial durability.
TI  - Structural origins of oxacillinase specificity in class D beta-lactamases.
AB  - Since the discovery and use of penicillin, the increase of antibiotic resistance  among bacterial pathogens has become a major health concern. The most prevalent resistance mechanism in Gram-negative bacteria is due to beta-lactamase expression. Class D beta-lactamases are of particular importance due to their presence in multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The class D enzymes were initially characterized by their ability to efficiently hydrolyze isoxazolyl-type beta-lactams like oxacillin. Due to this substrate preference, these enzymes are traditionally referred to as oxacillinases or OXAs. However, this class is comprised of subfamilies characterized by diverse activities that include oxacillinase, carbapenemase, or cephalosporinase substrate specificity. OXA-1 represents one subtype of class D enzyme that efficiently hydrolyzes oxacillin, and OXA-24/40 represents another with weak oxacillinase, but increased carbapenemase, activity. To examine the structural basis for the substrate selectivity differences between OXA-1 and OXA-24/40, the X-ray crystal structures of deacylation-deficient mutants of these enzymes (Lys70Asp for OXA-1; Lys84Asp for OXA-24) in complexes with oxacillin were determined to 1.4 A and 2.4 A, respectively. In the OXA-24/40/oxacillin structure, the hydrophobic R1 side chain of oxacillin disrupts the bridge between Tyr112 and Met223 present in the apo OXA-24/40 structure, causing the main chain of the Met223-containing loop to adopt a completely different conformation. In contrast, in the OXA-1/oxacillin structure, a hydrophobic pocket consisting of Trp102, Met99, Phe217, Leu161, and Leu255 nicely complements oxacillin's nonpolar R1 side chain. Comparison of the OXA-1/oxacillin and OXA-24/40/oxacillin complexes provides novel insight on how substrate selectivity is achieved among subtypes of class D beta-lactamases. By elucidating important active site interactions, these findings can also inform the design of novel antibiotics and inhibitors.
TI  - Short antibacterial peptides with significantly reduced hemolytic activity can be identified by a systematic L-to-D exchange scan of their amino acid residues.
AB  - High systemic toxicity of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) limits their clinical application to the treatment of topical infections; in parenteral systemic application of AMPs the problem of hemolysis is one of the first to be tackled. We now show that the selectivity of lipidated short synthetic AMPs can be optimized substantially by reducing their hemolytic activity without affecting their activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In order to identify the optimized peptides, two sets of 32 diastereomeric H-(D)Arg-WRWRW-(L)Lys(C(O)CnH2n+1)-NH2 (n = 7 or 9) peptides were prepared using a split-split procedure to perform a systematic L-to-D exchange scan on the central WRWRW-fragment. Compared to the all-L C8-lipidated lead sequence, diastereomeric peptides had very similar antibacterial properties, but were over 30 times less hemolytic. We show that the observed hemolysis and antibacterial activity is affected by both differences in lipophilicity of the different peptides and specific combinations of L- and D-amino acid residues. This study identified several peptides that can be used as tools to precisely unravel the origin of hemolysis and thus help to design even further optimized nontoxic very active short antibacterial peptides.
TI  - Association of biofilm production with multidrug resistance among clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Given choice, bacteria prefer a community-based, surface-bound colony to an individual existence. The inclination for bacteria to become surface bound is so ubiquitous in diverse ecosystems that it suggests a strong survival strategy and selective advantage for surface dwellers over their free-ranging counterparts. Virtually any surface, biotic or abiotic (animal, mineral, or vegetable) is suitable for bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. Thus, a biofilm is "a functional consortium of microorganisms organized within an extensive exopolymeric matrix." MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was undertaken to detect biofilm production from the repertoire stocks of Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) obtained from clinical specimens. The tube method was performed to qualitatively detect biofilm production. RESULTS: A total of 109 isolates of both organisms were included in the study, out of which 42% (46/109) isolates showed biofilm detection. Among the biofilm producers, 57% of P. aeruginosa and 73% of A. baumannii showed multidrug resistance (MDR) pattern which was statistically significant in comparison to nonbiofilm producers (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study to have tested the biofilm production in both P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii in a single study. Biofilm production and MDR pattern were found to be significantly higher in A. baumannii than P. aeruginosa. Antibiotic resistance was significantly higher among biofilm producing P. aeruginosa than non producers. Similarly, antibiotic resistance was significantly higher among biofilm producing A. baumannii than non producers.
TI  - Identification of small molecules inhibiting diguanylate cyclases to control bacterial biofilm development.
AB  - Biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria is an important virulence factor in the  development of numerous chronic infections, thereby causing a severe health burden. Many of these infections cannot be resolved, as bacteria in biofilms are resistant to the host's immune defenses and antibiotic therapy. An urgent need for new strategies to treat biofilm-based infections is critically needed. Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a widely conserved second-messenger signal essential for biofilm formation. The absence of this signalling system in higher eukaryotes makes it an attractive target for the development of new anti-biofilm agents. In this study, the results of an in silico pharmacophore-based screen to identify small-molecule inhibitors of diguanylate cyclase (DGC) enzymes that synthesize c-di-GMP are described. Four small molecules, LP 3134, LP 3145, LP 4010 and LP 1062 that antagonize these enzymes and inhibit biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in a continuous-flow system are reported. All four molecules dispersed P. aeruginosa biofilms and inhibited biofilm development on urinary catheters. One molecule dispersed A. baumannii biofilms. Two molecules displayed no toxic effects on eukaryotic cells. These molecules represent the first compounds identified from an in silico screen that are able to inhibit DGC activity to prevent biofilm formation.

AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and SAR study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
AB  - A series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. They were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida krusei, and Candida albicans. In this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). Then, we present a SAR study for Staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. The SAR study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.
TI  - A novel alkaloid from marine-derived actinomycete Streptomyces xinghaiensis with  broad-spectrum antibacterial and cytotoxic activities.
AB  - Due to the increasing emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and tumor cell lines,  novel antibiotics with antibacterial and cytotoxic activities are urgently needed. Marine actinobacteria are rich sources of novel antibiotics, and here we report the discovery of a novel alkaloid, xinghaiamine A, from a marine-derived actinomycete Streptomyces xinghaiensis NRRL B24674(T). Xinghaiamine A was purified from the fermentation broth, and its structure was elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR spectrum as well as mass spectrometry. Xinghaiamine A was identified to be a novel alkaloid with highly symmetric structure on the basis of sulfoxide functional group, and sulfoxide containing compound has so far never been reported in microorganisms. Biological assays revealed that xinghaiamine A exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activities to both Gram-negative persistent hospital pathogens (e.g. Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive ones, which include Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. In addition, xinghaiamine A also exhibited potent cytotoxic activity to human cancer cell lines of MCF-7 and U-937 with the IC50 of 0.6 and 0.5 microM, respectively.
TI  - [Drug resistance of imipenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in coal worker's pneumoconiosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with lower respiratory tract infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the drug resistance of imipenem-resistant (IR) Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) in coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP)-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and to provide a basis for clinical treatment. METHODS: Sixty-six strains of IR-GNB were isolated from the sputum of CWP-COPD patients with LRTI, and the bacterial spectrum was investigated. The drug resistance of bacterial strains was studied by KB disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Among the 66 strains of IR-GNB, 29 (43.9%) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 17 (25.8%) were Acinetobacter baumannii, and 11 (16.7%) were Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The drug sensitivity test showed that all bacteria had high drug resistance; Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a susceptibility rate higher than 50% to ciprofloxacin, polymyxin B, fosfomycin, and amikacin, Acinetobacter baumannii had a susceptibility rate higher than 55% to fosfomycin, polymyxin B, and cefoperazone/sulbactam, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia had a susceptibility rate higher than 50% to cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, polymyxin B, and cefoperazone/sulbactam, and Pseudomonas cepacia had a susceptibility rate higher than 50% to piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and polymyxin B. CONCLUSION: The main species of IR-GNB are such non-fermentative bacteria as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in CWP-COPD patients with LRTI. These bacteria have high drug resistance and are sensitive to only a limited range of antibiotics.
TI  - [The risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in newborn and the changes of isolated pathogens].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in  newborn and the profiles of isolated pathogens. METHODS: The clinical data of 179 neonates in the previous group (from December 2005 to December 2008) and 331 neonates in the present group (from January 2009 to January 2012) admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and received mechanical ventilation for equal or longer than 48 hours were respectively reviewed and analyzed,and their isolated pathogen profile and drug sensitivity were also compared in two groups. RESULTS: The incidence of VAP in the previous group and the present group were 22.35% and 20.24% respectively, no significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05) was observed. Gram-negative bacteria was the main pathogens (93.40%), the first 5 common pathogens in the previous group were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. However, the first 5 of isolated gram-negative pathogens in the present group were somewhat different from the previous group, which were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. The drug sensitivity test showed that these pathogens had a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics, of which the carbapenem antibiotic drug sensitivity decreased significantly, there was statistically significant difference between the previous group and the present group (P < 0.05). The risk factors of VAP include the duration of mechanical ventilation (OR = 5.680, 95% CI: 2.867-11.253), the frequency of tracheal intubation (OR = 2.219, 95% CI: 1.037- 4.748), birth weight (OR = 2. 127, 95% CI: 1.067-4.238) and neonatal asphyxia (OR = 2.025, 95% CI: 1.079-3.799) as well as the duration of hospital stay (OR = 2.012, 95% CI: 1.215-3.967). CONCLUSIONS: According to the data in our hospital, the main pathogenic bacteria of VAP were gram-negative pathogens, which showed a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics. The incidence of VAP was closely related to the duration of mechanical ventilation, the frequency of intubation, birth weight and the hospitalization as well as the neonatal asphyxia.
TI  - Causative agents and resistance among hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia patients at Srinagarind Hospital, northeastern Thailand.
AB  - Abstract. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) have an impact on health care costs and mortality. The aim of this study was to identify the causative agents, antibiotics prescribed, cost of treatment and drug resistance trends among HAP and VAP patients at a tertiary-care hospital in northeastern Thailand during 2008 and 2009. The incidences of HAP in 2008 and 2009 were 0.7/1,000 and 0.55/1,000 hospital days, respectively. The incidences of VAP in 2008 and 2009 were 13.6/1,000 and 12.6/1,000 ventilator days, respectively. About 70% of HAP were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; and 70% of VAP were caused by A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. The ranking in the causative agents of HAP and VAP was not different, but more antimicrobial resistant organisms were seen in 2009. More than half of the costs of nosocomial infection treatment in 2008 and 2009 were the costs for HAP and VAP, 16.8 and 17.5 million Baht, respectively. Fewer A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates were sensitive to carbapenems. Only one-fifth of A. baumannii isolates were sensitive to cefoperazone/sulbactam. The only two antimicrobial agents with consistently good activity against A. baumannii were tigecycline (approximately 85%) and colistin (approximately 99%). Fifty-seven point six percent of P. aeruginosa isolates were sensitive to ceftazidime, 72.4% were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, 95.9% were sensitive to netilmycin and 99.2% were sensitive to colistin. Forty-seven percent of K. pneumoniae isolates were extended spectrum beta-lactamase and sensitive to carbapenems. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was the cause of 6-7% of HAP/VAP cases in our study.
TI  - Colistin: re-emergence of the 'forgotten' antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The treatment of the emerging multidrug resistant (MDR) gram-negative organisms is a challenge. The development of newer antibiotics has recently slowed down. This has led to the re-emergence of the 'old forgotten' antibiotic "Colistin", whose use had almost stopped (after 1970's) due to the high incidence of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Colistin (polymyxin E) is a polypeptide antibiotic belonging to polymyxin group of antibiotics with activity mainly against the gram-negative organisms. Use of colistin has been increasing in the recent past and newer studies have shown lesser toxicity and good efficacy. Colistin acts on the bacterial cell membrane resulting in increased cell permeability and cell lysis. Colistin can be administered orally, topically, by inhalational route, intramuscularly, intrathecally, and also intravenously. Parenteral Colistin (in the form of colistimethate sodium) has been used to treat ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bacteremia caused by MDR bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Inhaled Colistin is used for treating pneumonia/VAP due to MDR gram-negative organisms and also used prophylactically in patients with cystic fibrosis. This manuscript is a brief review of Colistin and its clinical applications in the pediatric population.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from 13 teaching hospitals across China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the antimicrobial resistance of nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli across China. METHODS: A total of 1247 consecutive and non-repetitive Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from 13 Chinese teaching hospitals from March to August 2012. All isolates were sent to a central laboratory for reidentification and susceptibility testing. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of meropenem and other antibacterial agents were determined by agar dilution method. And the data were analyzed with WHONET-5.6 software. RESULTS: The activity of antimicrobial agents against Enterobacteriaceae was in the following descending order of susceptibility rate: meropenem (97.5%, 849/871) , amikacin (94.5%, 823/871) , imipenem (93.6%, 815/871) , ertapenem (92.9%, 809/871) , piperacillin/tazobactam (89.9%, 783/871) , cefoperazone/sulbactam (83.5%, 727/871) , cefepime (78.1%, 680/871) , polymyxin B (77.0%, 670/871) , cefiazidime (69.6%, 606/871) , levofloxacin (69.2%, 603/871) , ciprofloxacin (63.6%, 554/871) , minocyline (63.1%, 550/871) , ceftriaxone (55.7%, 485/871) , cefotaxime (54.2%, 472/871) and cefoxitin (51.4%, 448/871) . The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was 64.3% (117/182) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and 32.1% (60/187) in Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumoniae) . The sensitivities of E. coli to meropenem and imipenem were 100%. And over 90% of E. coli was sensitive to ertapenem, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and polymyxin B. However, over 60% of E. coli was resistant to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. The susceptibility of K. pneumoniae to meropenem, imipenem, amikacin and polymyxin B maintained at over 90%. The activities of antimicrobial agents against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes and Citrobacter freundii were in the following descending order of susceptibility rate: meropenem (96.0%-100%) , imipenem (96.0%-100%) , polymyxin B (95.8%-100%) , amikacin (92.2%-100%) , ertapenem (85.6%-93.3%) , cefepime (77.8%-93.3%) , cefoperazone/sulbactam (78.4%-90.0%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (65.0%-89.8%) . The most susceptible agent against Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) was polymyxin B (100%) . The susceptibilities of A.baumannii to imipenem, meropenem and minocyline were 37.8% (65/172) , 36.0% (62/172) and 62.8% (108/172) respectively. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) were polymyxin B (97.2%, 173/178) , followed by amikacin (89.3%, 159/178) and cefiazidime (83.7%, 149/178) . Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute revised P.aeruginosa susceptibility standard in 2012. The sensitivity of piperacillin/tazobactam changed from 83.7% (149/178) to 77.5% (138/178) . The sensitivity of meropenem decreased from 78.1% ( 139/178 ) to 71.3% ( 127/178 ) while that of imipenem declined from 69.7% (124/178) to 59.6% (106/178) . The prevalence of multi-drug resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were 65.7% (113/172) and 9.0% (16/178) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenems remain highly active against Enterobacteriaceae. Increasing resistance of A. baumannii to all antimicrobial agents is noted. New breakpoint to P.aeruginosa has obvious effects on antimicrobial sensitivity.
TI  - [Health care associated multidrug-resistant bacteria in a pediatric hospital: five year experience].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In recent years there has been an increase of infections caused by  multidrug-resistant bacteria. Paediatric data are scarce, particularly at national level. AIMS: To analyse trends of health-care associated multidrug-resistant bacteria infections in a paediatric hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective incidence study was conducted in medical, surgical and intensive care wards in a level III paediatric hospital, from January 2005 to December 2009. The studied multidrug-resistant bacteria were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), ESBL-producing bacilli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA-MDR) and Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to carbapenems. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, treatment and presence of risk factors for these infections were analysed. RESULTS: During the study period 106 multidrug-resistant bacteria were identified, related to 72 children, predominantly male (65.3%). The most frequently identified multidrug-resistant bacteria were MRSA (35.8%), PA-MDR (29.2%) and ESBL-producing bacilli (17.9%). Of the 106 multidrug-resistant bacteria, 45 (42.5%) were causing infection. During the study period the annual proportion of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria went up from 32.0% in 2006 to 55.6% in 2009 (p = 0.376). The overall incidence rate of infection was 0.400 per 1 000 hospitalization-days, corresponding to 0.274 infections per 100 admissions, remaining stable over the five years. The most frequent infections were bloodstream (31.1%), intra-abdominal (20.0%), catheter-related (17.8%) and skin and soft tissue (11.1%). All children had risk factors and the most frequently identified were previous antibiotic therapy and underlying chronic disease (> 90%). Six children (13.3%) died during hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, there was an increase in the proportion of multidrug-resistant bacteria but with no statistical significance. The overall incidence rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria infection remained stable. MRSA were the most frequently identified bacteria, followed by PA-MDR and ESBL-producing bacilli. Bloodstream infections were the most frequent infections, followed by intra-abdominal and catheter-related. All children had risk factors, mainly previous antibiotic therapy and chronic disease.
TI  - Active surveillance for asymptomatic colonization with multidrug-resistant gram negative bacilli among injured service members--a three year evaluation.
AB  - In response to the high rates of colonization and infection by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (MDR GNB), many military treatment facilities (MTFs) have implemented additional infection control practices, such as active surveillance cultures for asymptomatic colonization. Results of surveillance cultures (June 2009 - May 2012) collected from patients at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (Landstuhl RMC), Germany, and three U.S. MTFs were analyzed to evaluate trends in MDR GNB colonization over time and across facilities. At Landstuhl RMC, 6.6 percent of patients were colonized on admission with MDR GNB compared to 12.4 percent of patients admitted to the participating U.S. MTFs. Escherichia coli was the predominant organism, representing 82.4 percent of MDR isolates at Landstuhl RMC and 67.1 to 83.3 percent at U.S. MTFs. Other common MDR GNB included Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa was often isolated from the surveillance cultures, it was never multidrug-resistant. Annual rates of MDR GNB colonization were not significantly different over the three-year period. Ongoing research includes assessment of predictive factors for MDR GNB colonization and the relationship between colonization and infection.
TI  - Current spectrum of bacterial infections in patients with nosocomial fever and neutropenia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neutropenic patients are vulnerable to a wide spectrum of infectious  agents. The aim of this study was to determine the current frequency of bacterial infections in patients with nosocomial fever and neutropenia. METHODS: In a retrospective study, the neutropenic patients' specimens with nosocomial fever were cultured on blood and MacConkey agar plates and evaluated at microbiology laboratory. Ninety-five significant isolates as species level were recognized by bacteriological techniques. RESULTS: The most observed microorganism was Escherichia coli, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Coagulase positive staphylococci and Coagulase negative staphylococci. One fungal infection was also observed. Overall, 67% of the organisms were gram negative, 29.8% gram positive, and 3.2% polymicrobial. CONCLUSION: The changing pattern of infectious agents in neutropenic patients overtime postulates the necessity of other studies to give the most up-to-date insight of the organisms to physicians.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured Cu-SiO2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
AB  - There is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (HCAI). One method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial materials. The antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in HCAI. The structure of the coatings was determined using Scanning Electron Microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. Antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on BS ISO 22196:2007. The coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. SEM showed nano-structured aggregates of Cu within a silica matrix. A log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. The results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. The coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.
TI  - Trends in multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli and the role of prolonged beta-lactam infusion in the intensive care unit.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli are emerging threats in the intensive care unit setting worldwide. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are increasing at an alarming rate, leaving limited therapeutic options. In addition, multidrug resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii has widely disseminated and become a frequent cause of nosocomial infections within many intensive care units. Therefore, resistance is increasing to all currently available antibiotics, including cephalosporins, penicillins, aztreonam, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. Some multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria remain susceptible to only a few antibiotics such as tigecycline, fosfomycin, and polymyxins. The steady trend of increasing resistance coupled with the lack of novel antibiotics targeting resistant gram-negative bacilli has forced clinicians to increasingly apply more aggressive dosing strategies, such as prolonged and continuous infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics to address the challenges associated with these difficult-to-treat pathogens. Nurses who have a thorough understanding of antibiotic resistance patterns, infection control procedures, and appropriate antibiotic use and dosing regimens, particularly the method of administration, are essential in the battle to preserve the usefulness of antibiotics and prevent further antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Annual point-prevalence of healthcare-associated infection surveys in a university hospital in China, 2007-2011.
AB  - Successive point-prevalence surveys were conducted annually from 2007 to 2011 to  monitor the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in a university hospital in Hubei Province in China. The surveys used the case definition criteria established by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China. In the 5 surveys, the overall frequency of HAIs was 3.16% (301/9533). No significant differences were identified in the point prevalence measurements of HAIs in any of the years from 2007 to 2011. Of all the cases, proportionally, the most frequent infection site was the respiratory tract (2.34%), followed by surgical sites (0.43%) and urinary tract sites (0.28%). Gram-negative aerobic bacilli were the most common organisms mentioned; the most frequently isolated organism was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. Approximately one-half of the patients were receiving antibiotics at the time of the surveys. Cephalosporin, penicillin, and quinolone were most commonly used for treatment or prevention. The differences found in HAI prevalence data across the 5 surveys given in the hospital were not statistically significant. In conclusion, this successive point-prevalence survey provides information about the trend of HAI prevalence, epidemical character, and the use of antibiotics among the university hospital's in-patients. This information allows us to initiate targeted programs for infection prevention and control.
TI  - Mutant prevention concentrations of colistin for Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates.
AB  
TI  - Lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanocluster-based affinity mass spectrometry for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - RATIONALE: Bacterial infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to irreversible damage to patients if proper treatment is not provided in time. Additionally, the emerging threat from antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains makes medical treatment even more difficult. Thus, rapid identification of infected bacterial strains is essential to assist diagnostics and medical treatment. METHODS: Lysozymes are glycoside hydrolases that can bind with peptidoglycans on bacterial cell walls. In this work, we demonstrated that lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanoclusters (lysozyme-AuNCs) with red photoluminescence can be used as affinity probes to concentrate pathogenic bacteria. After bacteria had been probed by the lysozyme-AuNCs in a sample solution, the lysozyme-AuNC-bacteria conjugates were readily spun down at a low centrifugation speed. The red emission from the AuNCs on the conjugates could be visualized with the naked eye under illumination of ultraviolet light. The bacteria in the conjugates can be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) combined with principal component analysis (PCA). RESULTS: We demonstrated that pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) can be readily concentrated by the lysozyme-AuNCs and distinguished by the results combining MALDI-MS and PCA. Additionally, the possibility of using the current approach to differentiate E. faecalis from VRE was also demonstrated. The lowest detection concentration for E. coli using the current approach is ~10(6) cells/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the lysozyme-AuNCs are effective affinity probes for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. By combining the results from MALDI-MS and PCA, different bacteria can be easily distinguished. The current approach can be potentially used to assist the identification of bacteria from biological fluids.
TI  - Effect of aerosolized colistin as adjunctive treatment on the outcomes of microbiologically documented ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by colistin-only susceptible gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing frequency of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by colistin-only susceptible (COS) gram-negative bacteria (GNB) is of great concern. Adjunctive aerosolized (AS) colistin can reportedly increase alveolar levels of the drug without increasing systemic toxicity. Good clinical results have been obtained in patients with cystic fibrosis, but conflicting data have been reported in patients with VAP. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, 1:1 matched case-control study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AS plus IV colistin vs IV colistin alone in 208 patients in the ICU with VAP caused by COS Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. RESULTS: Compared with the IV colistin cohort, the AS-IV colistin cohort had a higher clinical cure rate (69.2% vs 54.8%, P = .03) and required fewer days of mechanical ventilation after VAP onset (8 days vs 12 days, P = .001). In the 166 patients with posttreatment cultures, eradication of the causative organism was also more common in the AS-IV colistin group (63.4% vs 50%, P = .08). No between-cohort differences were observed in all-cause ICU mortality, length of ICU stay after VAP onset, or rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) during colistin therapy. Independent predictors of clinical cure were trauma-related ICU admission (P = .01) and combined AS-IV colistin therapy (P = .009). Higher mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (P = .002) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (P = .05) scores, septic shock (P &lt; .001), and AKI onset during colistin treatment (P = .04) were independently associated with clinical failure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that AS colistin might be a beneficial adjunct to IV colistin in the management of VAP caused by COS GNB.
TI  - Phenotypic detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from hospitalized patients in Sao Luis, State of Maranhao, Brazil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acquired metallo-beta-lactamases (MbetaL) are emerging determinants of resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The objectives of this study were to phenotypically detect MbetaL in imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, to investigate the association between MbetaL-positive strains and hospitals, and to compare the resistance profiles of MbetaL-producing and non-MbetaL-producing strains. METHODS: The approximation disk and combined disk assay methods were used in this study. RESULTS: A total of 18 (38.3%) P. aeruginosa isolates and 1 (5.6%) A. baumannii isolate tested positive for the presence of MbetaL. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the need for strict surveillance and for the adoption of preventive measures to reduce the spread of infection and potential outbreaks of disease caused by MbetaL-producing microorganisms.
TI  - Comparison of pathogens and antibiotic resistance of burn patients in the burn ICU or in the common burn ward.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to compare pathogens and their antibiotic resistances of burn patients from burn intensive care unit (ICU) or common burn ward. Of 2395 clinical samples from 63 patients in burn ICU, pathogens were detected in 1621 samples, in which 1203 strains (74.2%) were Gram negative bacteria, 248 strains (15.3%) were Gram positive bacteria, 170 strains (10.5%) were fungi. Top-4 microorganisms isolated from patients in burn ICU were Bauman's Acinetobacter (557, 34.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (287.17.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (199, 12.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (171, 10.5%). Of 512 clinical samples from 235 patients in common burn units, pathogens were detected in 373 samples, in which 189 (50.6%) strains were Gram negative bacteria, 150 strains (40.2%) were Gram positive bacteria, 34 strains (9.2%) were fungi. Top-4 microorganisms isolated from patients in common burn units were S. aureus (103, 27.6%), P. aeruginosa (46, 12.3%), K. pneumoniae (38, 10.2%) and Escherichia coli (32, 8.6%). Antibiotic resistance rates of pathogens isolated from clinical samples of burn patients from ICU was significantly higher than those from common units. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens and their antibiotic resistances are significantly different between burn ICU and common burn units. This finding has great implication for infection control in burn patients.
TI  - Risk factors for acute kidney injury in critically ill patients receiving high intravenous doses of colistin methanesulfonate and/or other nephrotoxic antibiotics: a retrospective cohort study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Use of colistin methanesulfonate (CMS) was abandoned in the 1970s because of excessive nephrotoxicity, but it has been reintroduced as a last-resort treatment for extensively drug-resistant infections caused by gram-negative bacteria (Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia). We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate risk factors for new-onset acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients receiving high intravenous doses of colistin methanesulfonate and/or other nephrotoxic antibiotics. METHODS: The cohort consisted of 279 adults admitted to two general ICUs in teaching hospitals between 1 April 2009 and 30 June 2011 with 1) no evidence on admission of acute or chronic kidney disease; and 2) treatment for more than seven days with CMS and/or other nephrotoxic antimicrobials (NAs, that is, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with this outcome. RESULTS: The 279 cases that met the inclusion criteria included 147 patients treated with CMS, alone (n = 90) or with NAs (n = 57), and 132 treated with NAs alone. The 111 (40%) who developed AKI were significantly older and had significantly higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) scores than those who did not develop AKI, but rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure were similar in the two groups. The final logistic regression model showed that in the 147 patients who received CMS alone or with NAs, onset of AKI during the ICU stay was associated with septic shock and with SAPS II scores >/=43. Similar results were obtained in the 222 patients treated with CMS alone or NAs alone. CONCLUSIONS: In severely ill ICU patients without pre-existing renal disease who receive CMS high-dose for more than seven days, CMS therapy does not appear to be a risk factor for this outcome. Instead, the development of AKI was strongly correlated with the presence of septic shock and with the severity of the patients as reflected by the SAPS II score.
TI  - Toward repurposing ciclopirox as an antibiotic against drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant infections caused by gram-negative bacteria are a major healthcare concern. Repurposing drugs circumvents the time and money limitations associated with developing new antimicrobial agents needed to combat these antibiotic-resistant infections. Here we identified the off-patent antifungal agent, ciclopirox, as a candidate to repurpose for antibiotic use. To test the efficacy of ciclopirox against antibiotic-resistant pathogens, we used a curated collection of Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates that are representative of known antibiotic resistance phenotypes. We found that ciclopirox, at 5-15 microg/ml concentrations, inhibited bacterial growth regardless of the antibiotic resistance status. At these same concentrations, ciclopirox reduced growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, but some of these pathogens required higher ciclopirox concentrations to completely block growth. To determine how ciclopirox inhibits bacterial growth, we performed an overexpression screen in E. coli. This screen revealed that galE, which encodes UDP-glucose 4-epimerase, rescued bacterial growth at otherwise restrictive ciclopirox concentrations. We found that ciclopirox does not inhibit epimerization of UDP-galactose by purified E. coli GalE; however, DeltagalU, DeltagalE, DeltarfaI, or DeltarfaB mutant strains all have lower ciclopirox minimum inhibitory concentrations than the parent strain. The galU, galE, rfaI, and rfaB genes all encode enzymes that use UDP-galactose or UDP-glucose for galactose metabolism and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. Indeed, we found that ciclopirox altered LPS composition of an E. coli clinical isolate. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ciclopirox affects galactose metabolism and LPS biosynthesis, two pathways important for bacterial growth and virulence. The lack of any reported fungal resistance to ciclopirox in over twenty years of use in the clinic, its excellent safety profiles, novel target(s), and efficacy, make ciclopirox a promising potential antimicrobial agent to use against multidrug-resistant problematic gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis of in vitro synergy of polymyxins and carbapenems.
AB  - Our objective was to examine the evidence of in vitro synergy of polymyxin-carbapenem combination therapy against Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. All studies examining in vitro interactions of antibiotic combinations consisting of any carbapenem with colistin or polymyxin B against any GNB were used. A broad search was conducted with no language, date, or publication status restrictions. Synergy rates, defined as a fractional inhibitory concentration index of </=0.5 or a >2-log reduction in CFU, were pooled separately for time-kill, checkerboard, and Etest methods in a mixed-effect meta-analysis of rates. We examined whether the synergy rate depended on the testing method, type of antibiotic, bacteria, and resistance to carbapenems. Pooled rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are shown. Thirty-nine published studies and 15 conference proceeding were included, reporting on 246 different tests on 1,054 bacterial isolates. In time-kill studies, combination therapy showed synergy rates of 77% (95% CI, 64 to 87%) for Acinetobacter baumannii, 44% (95% CI, 30 to 59%) for Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 50% (95% CI, 30 to 69%) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with low antagonism rates for all. Doripenem showed high synergy rates for all three bacteria. For A. baumannii, meropenem was more synergistic than imipenem, whereas for P. aeruginosa the opposite was true. Checkerboard and Etest studies generally reported lower synergy rates than time-kill studies. The use of combination therapy led to less resistance development in vitro. The combination of a carbapenem with a polymyxin against GNB, especially A. baumannii, is supported in vitro by high synergy rates, with low antagonism and less resistance development. These findings should be examined in clinical studies.
TI  - Chlorhexidine activity against bacterial biofilms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A biofilm is a complex microbiological ecosystem deposited on surfaces. Microorganisms in form of biofilms are of particular clinical concern because of the poor response to antimicrobial treatments. This study aimed to determine whether bacterial and fungal biofilms are able to resist the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine, a powerful antiseptic widely used in the hospital environment. METHODS: Disk diffusion and susceptibility tests were conducted in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute standards for the determination of biofilm inhibitory concentration. Chlorhexidine was tested first at a minimum inhibitory concentration and then at higher concentrations when it was not able to destroy the biofilm. The plates were developed with a solution of 0.1% crystal violet, and readings were made at an optical density of 570 nm. RESULTS: Chlorhexidine demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activity for most microorganisms tested in their free form, but was less effective against biofilms of Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that microorganisms in biofilms have greater resistance to chlorhexidine, likely owing to the mechanisms of resistance conferred to the structure of biofilms.
TI  - Class D beta-lactamases: a reappraisal after five decades.
AB  - Despite 70 years of clinical use, beta-lactam antibiotics still remain at the forefront of antimicrobial chemotherapy. The major challenge to these life-saving therapeutics is the presence of bacterial enzymes (i.e., beta-lactamases) that can hydrolyze the beta-lactam bond and inactivate the antibiotic. These enzymes can be grouped into four classes (A-D). Among the most genetically diverse are the class D beta-lactamases. In this class are beta-lactamases that can inactivate the entire spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems). Class D beta-lactamases are mostly found in Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Escherichia coli , Proteus mirabilis , and Acinetobacter baumannii . The active-sites of class D beta-lactamases contain an unusual N-carboxylated lysine post-translational modification. A strongly hydrophobic active-site helps create the conditions that allow the lysine to combine with CO2, and the resulting carbamate is stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds. The carboxy-lysine plays a symmetric role in the reaction, serving as a general base to activate the serine nucleophile in the acylation reaction, and the deacylating water in the second step. There are more than 250 class D beta-lactamases described, and the full set of variants shows remarkable diversity with regard to substrate binding and turnover. Narrow-spectrum variants are most effective against the earliest generation penicillins and cephalosporins such as ampicillin and cephalothin. Extended-spectrum variants (also known as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ESBLs) pose a more dangerous clinical threat as they possess a small number of substitutions that allow them to bind and hydrolyze later generation cephalosporins that contain bulkier side-chain constituents (e.g., cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime). Mutations that permit this versatility seem to cluster in the area surrounding an active-site tryptophan resulting in a widened active-site to accommodate the oxyimino side-chains of these cephalosporins. More concerning are the class D beta-lactamases that hydrolyze clinically important carbapenem beta-lactam drugs (e.g., imipenem). Whereas carbapenems irreversibly acylate and inhibit narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases, class D carbapenemases are able to recruit and activate a deacylating water. The rotational orientation of the C6 hydroxyethyl group found on all carbapenem antibiotics likely plays a role in whether the deacylating water is effective or not. Inhibition of class D beta-lactamases is a current challenge. Commercially available inhibitors that are active against other classes of beta-lactamases are ineffective against class D enzymes. On the horizon are several compounds, consisting of both beta-lactam derivatives and non-beta-lactams, that have the potential of providing novel leads to design new mechanism-based inactivators that are effective against the class D enzymes. Several act synergistically when given in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, and others show a unique mechanism of inhibition that is distinct from the traditional beta-lactamase inhibitors. These studies will bolster structure-based inhibitor design efforts to facilitate the optimization and development of these compounds as class D inactivators.
TI  - The role of antimicrobial stewardship in curbing carbapenem resistance.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a continuing, growing, worldwide iatrogenic complication of modern medical care. Carbapenem resistance among certain pathogens poses a significant challenge. In order to reduce the spread of these nearly untreatable pathogens, preventative efforts should be directed at reducing patient-to-patient transmission and preventing the emergence of resistance among susceptible strains. One theoretical intervention to reduce the emergence of resistance is establishing and strictly adhering to an antimicrobial stewardship program. However, data pertaining to the direct effect of stewardship in curtailing carbapenem resistance among epidemiologically significant organisms are scarce. In this report, we review the potential biases associated with data interpretation in this research field, and we review the data pertaining to the impact of stewardship in curbing carbapenem resistance in three significant groups of pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii.
TI  - [Adherence to copper and stainless steel metal coupons of common nosocomial bacterial strains].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Copper has a bactericidal activity against a series of bacterial strains. AIM: To measure resistance to bacterial adherence of copper (Cu) and stainless steel (SS) metal coupons. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial strains causing nosocomial infections in Chile were analyzed. Bacterial adherence was studied using a previously described method based on a system of metal coupons that are immersed in culture media containing the bacteria of interest at room temperature. RESULTS: Adherence to Cu and SS coupons was different for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii strains. For these strains, no adherence to Cu coupons occurred during the 48 h observation period compared to a rapidly increasing adherence to SS coupons, with a final colony count of 1.00 E + 07 cfu/mL. For two different Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains, inhibition of adherence was not observed on Cu coupons, and colony counts were similar for Cu and SS using the standard inoculum (2-3 x lO7 cfu).A partial decrease in adherence was observed for Cu but not for SS coupons, when a lower inoculum was used. CONCLUSIONS: Copper surfaces represent an interesting option to reduce bacterial contamination in the hospital environment due to its resistance to bacterial adhesion of most of the common nosocomial bacterial strains.
TI  - [Sterilizing effect and residual bacteria of four different methods for sterilizing simple breathing vesicles].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of 4 different methods for disinfection of simple breathing vesicles and microbial residue. METHODS: The disinfection tests were divided into 4 groups: G1 group (43 cases) with 500 mg/L chlorine dioxide spray, G2 group (28 cases) with alcohol spray, G3 group (47 cases) with 50 mg/L trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) immersion, and G4 group (46 cases) with 50 mg/L chlorine dioxide solution immersion. After 30 min of disinfection, each group was examined by bacterial culture and colony count. The residual bacteria were identified and typed. RESULTS: The 4 methods showed significant differences in bacterial colony count (P<0.001). The rate of bacterial residue was 0% in G1 group, 53.6% in G2 group, 27.7% in G3 group, and 21.7% in G4 group, showing significant differences between the 4 groups (P<0.001). The residual bacteria included antibiotic-resistant common opportunistic pathogen such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus haemolytic. CONCLUSIONS: Disinfection with 500 mg/L chlorine dioxide spray is the best for simple breathing vesicles. Prolonged immersion in TCCA may lead to the growth of drug-resistant pathogens in the breathing vesicles.
TI  - Risk factors and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens in solid-organ transplant recipients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infections due to the six ESKAPE pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problem, information regarding bacteremia caused by these organisms in solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients is lacking. We sought to determine the frequency, risk factors, and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant ESKAPE (rESKAPE) organisms in liver, kidney, and heart adult transplant recipients. METHODS: All episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized SOT recipients from 2007 to 2012 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 276 episodes of bacteremia, 54 (19.6%) were due to rESKAPE strains (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium [0], methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [5], extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [10], carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii [8], carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa [26], and derepressed chromosomal beta-lactam and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacter species [5]). Factors independently associated with rESKAPE bacteremia were prior transplantation, septic shock, and prior antibiotic therapy. Patients with rESKAPE bacteremia more often received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy than the others (41% vs. 21.6%; P=0.01). Overall case-fatality rate (30 days) was higher in patients with rESKAPE bacteremia (35.2% vs. 14.4%; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia due to rESKAPE pathogens is frequent in SOT recipients and causes significant morbidity and mortality. rESKAPE organisms should be considered when selecting empirical antibiotic therapy for hospitalized SOT recipients presenting with septic shock, particularly those with prior transplantation and antibiotic use.
TI  - Current status of carbapenemases in Latin America.
AB  - Enterobacteriaceae and non fermenting Gram-negative bacilli have become a threat  to public health, in part due to their resistance to multiple antibiotic classes, which ultimately have led to an increase in morbidity and mortality. beta-lactams are currently the mainstay for combating infections caused by these microorganisms, and beta-lactamases are the major mechanism of resistance to this class of antibiotics. Within the beta-lactamases, carbapenemases pose one of the gravest threats, as they compromise one of our most potent lines of defense, the carbapenems. Carbapenemases are being continuously identified worldwide; and in Latin America, numerous members of these enzymes have been reported. In this region, the high incidence of reports implies that carbapenemases have become a menace and that they are an issue that must be carefully studied and analyzed.
TI  - Detection of the common resistance genes in Gram-negative bacteria using gene chip technology.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To design a resistance gene detection chip that could, in parallel, detect common clinical drug resistance genes of Gram-negative bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy clinically significant Gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii) were collected. According to the known resistance gene sequences, we designed and synthesized primers and probes, which were used to prepare resistance gene detection chips, and finally we hybridized and scanned the gene detection chips. RESULTS: The results between the gene chip and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were compared. The rate was consistently 100% in the eight kinds of resistance genes tested (TEM, SHV, CTX-M, DHA, CIT, VIM, KPC, OXA-23). One strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa had the IMP, but it was not found by gene chip. CONCLUSION: The design of Gram-negative bacteria-resistant gene detection chip had better application value.
TI  - Risk factors for drug-resistant bacterial pneumonia in older patients hospitalized with pneumonia in a Chinese population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and resistant bacteria is unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for pneumonia caused by drug-resistant bacteria (DRB). METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Consecutive older patients (aged >/=65 years) were hospitalized with pneumonia from January 2004 to June 2005. DRB comprised methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: The entire cohort consisted of 1176 older patients. Of 472 (40.1%) patients with etiological diagnosis established, bacterial pneumonia was found in 354 (30.1%) cases. DRB were isolated in 48 patients: P. aeruginosa (41), MRSA (5) and ESBL producing enteric bacilli (3). Co-infection with P. aeruginosa and MRSA was found in one patient. The prevalence of DRB in culture-positive pneumonia was 20.1% (48/239). Patients with DRB were more likely to have limitation in activities of daily living, bronchiectasis, dementia, severe pneumonia, recent hospitalization and recent antibiotic use. Logistic regression revealed that bronchiectasis [relative risk (RR) 14.12, P = 0.002], recent hospitalization (RR 4.89, P < 0.001) and severe pneumonia (RR 2.42, P = 0.010) were independent predictors of drug-resistant bacterial pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Recent hospitalization is the only risk factor for HCAP which is shown to be associated with DRB. Nursing home residence is not a risk factor. The concept of HCAP may not be totally applicable in Hong Kong where the prevalence of drug-resistant pathogens in pneumonia is low.
TI  - Patterns of nosocomial infections, multidrug-resistant microorganisms, and mold detection after extensive black-water flooding: a survey from central Thailand.
AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of the novel monosulfactam BAL30072 alone and in combination with meropenem versus a diverse collection of important Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - The problem of antimicrobial resistance is exemplified by multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates of Gram-negative species. Of particular concern are expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, epidemic lineages of Acinetobacter baumannii producing OXA-type carbapenemases, and MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study, the in vitro activity of the novel monosulfactam BAL30072 was investigated both alone and in combination with meropenem against a diverse collection of commonly encountered Gram-negative pathogens. Thirty-one isolates were studied, including type strains and clinical isolates with defined mechanisms conferring resistance to various antimicrobial agents including to carbapenems, colistin and tigecycline. BAL30072 minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in the presence and absence of meropenem (1:1, w/w) by agar dilution. Potential synergy or antagonism between BAL30072 and meropenem was investigated using standard chequerboard assays. Versus MDR A. baumannii strains producing class D oxacillinases, BAL30072 MICs were all </=4 mg/L with the exception of the isolate belonging to the UK 'Burn' lineage. BAL30072 exhibited MIC values of 0.5 mg/L to >64 mg/L towards the five P. aeruginosa strains. Against three meropenem-susceptible Escherichia coli, including the CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producer, BAL30072 exhibited MICs of 0.25-2 mg/L; higher MICs were recorded against some of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates tested. The in vitro data suggest that BAL30072 has a potential role in the treatment of infections due to Gram-negative pathogens, including those with important resistances to other agents. In addition, BAL30072 shows powerful synergistic activity in combination with meropenem, potentially expanding its coverage for the treatment of infections caused by problematic species.
TI  - Evaluation of anti-resistant activity of Auklandia (Saussurea lappa) root against some human pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The antimicrobial activity of the ethanol extract of the Auklandia (Saussurea lappa)root plant was investigated to verify its medicinal use in the treatment of microbial infections. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of the ethanol extract was tested against clinical isolates of some multidrug-resistant bacteria using the agar well diffusion method. Commercial antibiotics were used as positive reference standards to determine the sensitivity of the clinical isolates. RESULTS: The extracts showed significant inhibitory activity against clinical isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactemase, Acinetobacter baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentration values obtained using the agar dilution test ranged from 2.0 microg/microL-12.0 microg/microL. In the contrary the water extract showed no activity at all against the tested isolates. Furthermore, the results obtained by examining anti-resistant activity of the plant ethanolic extract showed that at higher concentration of the plant extract (12 microg) all tested bacteria isolates were inhibited with variable inhibition zones similar to those obtained when we applied lower extract concentration using the well diffusion assay. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the crude ethanolic extract of the Auklandia (Saussurea lappa) root plant has a wide spectrum of activity suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of infections caused by the above clinical isolates (human pathogens).
TI  - In vitro sensitivity of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbapenems among intensive care unit patients.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogens are the most common  causes of fatal pneumonia among patients treated in Intensive Care Units (ICU). Carbapenems remain a group of antibiotics characterized by the highest effectiveness in treatment of heavy infections of the lower respiratory tract. This study compared in vitro sensitivity of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa to three carbapenems: imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. The material was collected from 71 patients treated in the ICU from April 2009 to January 2010. Bronchial tree was the predominant source of samples. Fifty-four strains of A. baumannii and 17 strains of P. aeruginosa were analyzed. Sensitivity to carbapenems was interpreted in line with Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) and European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria (imipenem and meropenem) or in compliance with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CLSI guidelines (doripenem). We found that A. baumannii was significantly more often sensitive to imipenem than to doripenem and meropenem, but only according to the CLSI and FDA and not EUCAST criteria. The sensitivity of P. aeruginosa was higher to imipenem than to doripenem and meropenem, according to both CLSI and EUCAST criteria (64.7 %). We conclude that the EUCAST criteria demonstrate a higher rigor than those of CLSI and FDA in the determination of carbapenems sensitivity. Imipenem appears more effective than doripenem and meropenem in treatment of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections.
TI  - Anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activities of ethanol extracts of selected traditional Chinese medicinal herbs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro antimicrobial activities of selected 58 ethno-medicinal plant extracts with a view to assess their therapeutic potential. METHODS: A total of 58 traditional Chinese medicinal plants were carefully selected based on the literature review and their traditional use. The antimicrobial activities of ethanol extracts of these medicinal plants were tested against fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus), yeast (Candida albicans), gram-negative (Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus). The activities were tested at three different concentrations of 1.00, 0.10 and 0.01 mg/mL. The data was analysed using Gene data Screener program. RESULTS: The measured antimicrobial activities indicated that out of the 58 plant extracts, 15 extracts showed anti-fungal activity and 23 extracts exhibited anti-bacterial activity. Eight plant extracts have exhibited both anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. For instance, Eucommia ulmoides, Polygonum cuspidatum, Poria cocos and Uncaria rhyncophylla showed activity against both bacterial and fungal strains, indicating their broad spectrum of activity. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that the ethanol extracts of 30 plants out of the selected 58 possess significant antimicrobial activities. It is interesting to note that the findings from the current study are consistent with the traditional use. A clear correlation has also been found between the antimicrobial activity and the flavonoid content of the plant extracts which is in agreement with the literature. Hence, the results presented here can be used to guide the selection of potential plant species for the isolation and structure elucidation of novel antimicrobial compounds in order to establish the structure-activity relationship. This in turn is expected to lead the way to the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents for therapeutic use.
TI  - Purification and Characterization of Biofilm-Associated EPS Exopolysaccharides from ESKAPE Organisms and Other Pathogens.
AB  - In bacterial biofilms, high molecular weight, secreted exopolysaccharides can serve as a scaffold to which additional carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids adhere, forming the matrix of the developing biofilm. Here we report methods to extract and purify high molecular weight (>15 kDa) exopolysaccharides from biofilms of eight human pathogens, including species of Staphylcococcus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and a toxigenic strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Glycosyl composition analysis indicated a high total mannose content across all strains with P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii exopolysaccharides comprised of 80-90% mannose, K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis strains containing 40-50% mannose, and E. coli with approximately 10% mannose. Galactose and glucose were also present in all eight strains, usually as the second and third most abundant carbohydrates. N-acetyl-glucosamine and galacturonic acid were found in 6 of 8 strains, while arabinose, fucose, rhamnose, and xylose were found in 5 of 8 strains. For linkage analysis, 33 distinct residue-linkage combinations were detected with the most abundant being mannose-linked moieties, in line with the composition analysis. The exopolysaccharides of two P. aeruginosa strains analyzed were consistent with the Psl carbohydrate, but not Pel or alginate. The S. epidermidis strain had a composition rich in mannose and glucose, which is consistent with the previously described slime associated antigen (SAA) and the extracellular slime substance (ESS), respectively, but no polysaccharide intracellular adhesion (PIA) was detected. The high molecular weight exopolysaccharides from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii appear to be novel, based on composition and/or ratio analysis of carbohydrates.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of a novel silver hydrogel dressing compared to two common silver burn wound dressings: Acticoat and PolyMem Silver((R)).
AB  - A novel burn wound hydrogel dressing has been previously developed which is composed of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid sodium salt with silver nanoparticles. This study compared the antimicrobial efficacy of this novel dressing to two commercially available silver dressings; Acticoat and PolyMem Silver((R)). Three different antimicrobial tests were used: disc diffusion, broth culture, and the Live/Dead((R)) Baclight bacterial viability assay. Burn wound pathogens (P. aeruginosa, MSSA, A. baumannii and C. albicans) and antibiotic resistant strains (MRSA and VRE) were tested. All three antimicrobial tests indicated that Acticoat was the most effective antimicrobial agent, with inhibition zone lengths of 13.9-18.4mm. It reduced the microbial inocula below the limit of detection (10(2)CFU/ml) and reduced viability by 99% within 4h. PolyMem Silver((R)) had no zone of inhibition for most tested micro-organisms, and it also showed poor antimicrobial activity in the broth culture and Live/Dead((R)) Baclight assays. Alarmingly, it appeared to promote the growth of VRE. The silver hydrogel reduced most of the tested microbial inocula below the detection limit and decreased bacterial viability by 94-99% after 24h exposure. These results support the possibility of using this novel silver hydrogel as a burn wound dressing in the future.
TI  - Spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. So far, data on this topic among Chinese are lacking. METHODS: A surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with AECOPD at five areas in China between October 2006 and April 2008. The sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. Agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with AECOPD. The predominant bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by Haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and Escherichia coli (3.6%). The majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with AECOPD in China. Haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in AECOPD. This study provides evidence for local surveillance of AECOPD pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in China.
TI  - Coral-associated bacteria, quorum sensing disrupters, and the regulation of biofouling.
AB  - Marine biofouling, the settlement of microorganisms and macroorganisms on structures submerged in seawater, although economically detrimental, is a successful strategy for survival in hostile environments, where coordinated bacterial communities establish biofilms via the regulation of quorum sensing (QS) communication systems. The inhibition of QS activity among bacteria isolated from different coral species was investigated to gain further insight into its potency in the attenuation, or even the prevention, of undesirable biofouling on marine organisms. It is hypothesized that coral mucus/microorganism interactions are competitive, suggesting that the dominant communities secrete QS disruptive compounds. One hundred and twenty bacterial isolates were collected from healthy coral species and screened for their ability to inhibit QS using three bioreporter strains. Approximately 12, 11, and 24% of the isolates exhibited anti-QS activity against Escherichia coli pSB1075, Chromobacterium violaceum CV026, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens KYC55 indicator strains, respectively. Isolates with positive activity against the bioluminescent monitor strains were scanned via a cytotoxic/genotoxic, E. coli TV1061 and DPD2794 antimicrobial panel. Isolates detected by C. violaceum CV026 and A. tumefaciens KYC55 reporter strains were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of these reporter strains, which were found to be unaffected. Tests of the Favia sp. coral isolate Fav 2-50-7 (>98% similarity to Vibrio harveyi) for its ability to attenuate the formation of biofilm showed extensive inhibitory activity against biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. To ascertain the stability and general structure of the active compound, cell-free culture supernatants exposed to an increasing temperature gradient or to digestion by proteinase K, were shown to maintain potent QS attenuation and the ability to inhibit the growth of biofilms. Mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of a low molecular mass compound. The anti-QS strategy exemplified in the coral mucus is a model with potentially wide applications, including countering the ecological threat posed by biofilms. Manipulating synchronized bacterial behavior by detecting new QS inhibitors will facilitate the discovery of new antifouling compounds.
TI  - Design and construction of a single tube, quantitative endpoint, LATE-PCR multiplex assay for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to develop a molecular diagnostic multiplex assay for the quantitative detection of microbial pathogens commonly responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and their antibiotic resistance using linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (LATE-PCR). METHOD AND RESULTS: This multiplex assay was designed for the quantitative detection and identification of pathogen genomic DNA of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, plus a control target from Lactococcus lactis. After amplification, the single-stranded amplicons were detected simultaneously in the same closed tube by hybridization to low-temperature molecular beacon probes labelled with four differently coloured fluorophores. The resulting hybrids were then analysed by determining the fluorescence intensity of each of the four fluorophores as a function of temperature. CONCLUSIONS: This LATE-PCR single tube multiplex assay generated endpoint fluorescent contours that allowed identification of all microbial pathogens commonly responsible for VAP, including MRSA. The assay was quantitative, identifying the pathogens present in the sample, no matter whether there were as few as 10 or as many 100 000 target genomes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This assay is rapid, reliable and sensitive and is ready for preclinical testing using samples recovered from patients suffering from ventilator-associated pneumonia.
TI  - Detection of carbapenemase encoding genes in Enterobacteriace, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumanii isolated from patients at Intensive Care Unit Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in 2011.
AB  - AIM: to determine the prevalence of carbapenemase encoding genes (blaIMP-1, blaVIM-2, blaKPC-2, blaOXA-48, and blaNDM-1) of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii isolated from the intensive care unit patients as pathogens, in Cipto Mangunkusumo hospital (ICU-RSCM) in 2011. METHODS: we examined the carbapenemase encoding genes in the clinical microbiology laboratory (LMK FKUI/RSCM). Duplex- and simplex PCR methods were conducted to detect the resistant genes. RESULTS: we found 4 (5%) P. aeruginosa strains carry blaIMP-1 gene and all were isolated from sputum specimens. The prevalence of carbapenem resistant among Gram-negative bacilli isolated from ICU-RSCM, are Enterobacteriaceae 27.6%, P. aeruginosa 21.9%, and A. baumannii 50.5%. The New Delhi Metallo--lactamase encoding gene (blaNDM-1) was detected in 1 K. pneumonia isolated from sputum as well. The other genes, i.e. blaKPC-2, blaVIM-2, and blaOXA-48 were not found in any isolates. The absence of other genes indicated that other mechanisms may play a role in the occurrence of carbapenem resistance in pathogens isolated in ICU-RSCM. CONCLUSION: this study confirmed that the prevalence of carbapenems resistant Gram-negative bacilli in ICU-RSCM in 2011 was high. The carbapenemase encoding genes, which were detected among the carbapenems resistant Gram-negative bacilli, were blaIMP-1 and blaNDM-1.
TI  - A rabbit osteomyelitis model to simulate multibacterial war wound infections.
AB  - A challenge facing military caregivers is the presence of multidrug-resistant infection in extremity wounds. Most frequently identified resistant strains are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), and Acinetobacter baumannii (AB). We adapted an existing osteomyelitis model to simulate an infected extremity wound for antibiotic testing. New Zealand White Rabbits (n = 95) were divided into 6 inoculation groups for infection with MRSA, KP, PA, and AB alone, and in multibacteria infections. Sodium morrhuate was injected into the left tibia to simulate blast wound trauma, then the respective bacteria or combination of pathogens, and finally sterile saline were injected. Colony-forming units for the mono-organism groups showed that AB, KP, or PA alone at 10(7) colony-forming units per mL (CFUs/mL) was effective for rabbit osteomyelitis induction. Colony-forming units for the multiorganism groups showed that the combination of AB (10(7) CFUs/mL)/KP (10(7) CFUs/mL)/PA (10(7) CFUs/mL)/MRSA (10(5) CFUs/mL) yielded a 100% osteomyelitis induction rate. At 8 weeks, however, only one mono-bacterial group and one multibacterial group showed significant radiographic improvement (p < 0.05). The rabbit model of osteomyelitis can be adapted to study infected blast wounds typical of those seen in veterans. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the model simulating multibacterial infections with multidrug-resistant organisms.
TI  - Wound healing potential of topical bacteriophage therapy on diabetic cutaneous wounds.
AB  - Chronic wounds that fail to heal are a common complication of diabetes mellitus and the most common precipitating reason for nontraumatic lower limb amputation. Unfortunately, the bacterial species that cause these infections are becoming more resistant to antibiotics, making them increasingly difficult to treat. We assessed the feasibility of combating chronic bacterial infections with a topically delivered bacteriophage cocktail in two animal models of diabetes mellitus. Microbiological, planimetric, and histological parameters were compared in debrided infected wounds with or without topical bacteriophage treatment. We determined that bacteriophage treatment effectively decreased bacterial colony counts and improved wound healing, as indicated by smaller epithelial and dermal gaps, in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections but was not as effective against Acinetobacter baumannii. Although the improvements were more significant in the rodent model than in the porcine model, our results suggest that topically administered bacteriophage treatment may be effective in resolving chronic infections, especially when applied in conjunction with wound debridement. These findings have important implications for the feasibility of using topical antimicrobial therapies to safely treat chronic infections in diabetes mellitus patients.
TI  - Discovery of Dap-3 polymyxin analogues for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative nosocomial infections.
AB  - We report novel polymyxin analogues with improved antibacterial in vitro potency  against polymyxin resistant recent clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . In addition, a human renal cell in vitro assay (hRPTEC) was used to inform structure-toxicity relationships and further differentiate analogues. Replacement of the Dab-3 residue with a Dap-3 in combination with a relatively polar 6-oxo-1-phenyl-1,6-dihydropyridine-3-carbonyl side chain as a fatty acyl replacement yielded analogue 5x, which demonstrated an improved in vitro antimicrobial and renal cytotoxicity profiles relative to polymyxin B (PMB). However, in vivo PK/PD comparison of 5x and PMB in a murine neutropenic thigh model against P. aeruginosa strains with matched MICs showed that 5x was inferior to PMB in vivo, suggesting a lack of improved therapeutic index in spite of apparent in vitro advantages.
TI  - Emergence of 16S rRNA methylase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in hospitals in Vietnam.
AB  - BACKGROUND: 16S rRNA methylase-producing Gram-negative bacteria are highly resistant to all clinically important aminoglycosides. We analyzed clinical strains of 16S rRNA methylase-producing Acinetobactor baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained from clinical isolates in medical settings in Vietnam. METHODS: From 2008 to 2011, 101 clinical strains of A. baumannii and 15 of P. aeruginosa were isolated from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in two medical settings in Vietnam. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using the microdilution method and epidemiological analysis was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and MLST. Genes encoding the 16S rRNA methylases, OXAs and CTX-Ms were analyzed by PCR and sequence analysis. RESULTS: 16S rRNA methylase-producing Gram-negative pathogens were detected in two hospitals in Vietnam. Of the 101 clinical isolates of A. baumannii and the 15 of P. aeruginosa isolated from two ICUs in these hospitals, 72 (71.3%) were highly resistant to amikacin, arbekacin and gentamicin, with MICs greater than 1,024 mg/L. The 16S rRNA methylases ArmA and RmtB were produced by 61 and 9 isolates of A. baumannii, respectively, and RmtB was produced by 2 isolates of P. aeruginosa. Moreover, 52 of the A. baumannii isolates producing 16S rRNA methylases harbored both blaOXA-23-like and blaOXA-51-like genes. Most A. baumannii isolates producing 16S rRNA methylase obtained in hospital A in Hanoi were ST91 and ST231, whereas most from hospital B in Ho Chi Minh City were ST136, ST195, and ST254. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria producing the 16S rRNA methylases ArmA and RmtB are emerging in medical settings in Vietnam. A. baumannii isolates in northern and southern regions of Vietnam may be of different lineages.
TI  - [Epidemiology of hospital-acquired infections in an adult intensive care unit: results of a prospective cohort study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the pattern of nosocomial infections in an adult  medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A 2-year prospective cohort study of nosocomial infection surveillance in a 12 - bed adult medical and surgical ICU of the Federico II University Hospital in Naples, was carried out. Data were collected between January 2009 and December 2010 using the standard surveillance protocols and nosocomial infection site definitions of the National Healthcare Safety Network's ICU surveillance component. RESULTS: Out of 768 patients hospitalized during this period, 434 with an ICU stay longer than 48 h were included in the study. Fifty-three patients acquired a total of 71 nosocomial infections; 55 (77,5%) ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP), 10 (14,1%), central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLA-BSI) and 6 (8,4%) catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI). The overall patient day rate was 12,9 patient days. The patient infection rate was 16,3 patients at risk. The mean VAP rate was 15,0/1.000 ventilator days, the CLA-BSI rate 2,9/1.000 central line days and the CA-UTI rate 1,2/1.000 catheter days. Of the nosocomial infections, 65 were Gram-negative, 6 Gram-positive and 5 fungal. The most frequent organism was Acinetobacter baumannii (61,9%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22,5%), Enterococcus fecalis (4,2%) and Candida albicans (4,2%). The crude mortality was 35% among ICU-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: VAP was the most common nosocomial infection in our ICU. Gram-negative organisms were more commonly reported as etiologic agents of ICU infections.
TI  - Pharmacology of polymyxins: new insights into an 'old' class of antibiotics.
AB  - Increasing antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, particularly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, presents a global medical challenge. No new antibiotics will be available for these 'superbugs' in the near future due to the dry antibiotic discovery pipeline. Colistin and polymyxin B are increasingly used as the last-line therapeutic options for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. This article surveys the significant progress over the last decade in understanding polymyxin chemistry, mechanisms of antibacterial activity and resistance, structure-activity relationships and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. In the 'Bad Bugs, No Drugs' era, we must pursue structure-activity relationship-based approaches to develop novel polymyxin-like lipopeptides targeting polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative 'superbugs'. Before new antibiotics become available, we must optimize the clinical use of polymyxins through the application of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles, thereby minimizing the development of resistance.
TI  - Clinical use of colistin induces cross-resistance to host antimicrobials in Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The alarming rise in antibiotic resistance has led to an increase in patient mortality and health care costs. This problem is compounded by the absence of new antibiotics close to regulatory approval. Acinetobacter baumannii is a human pathogen that causes infections primarily in patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and is highly antibiotic resistant. Colistin is one of the last-line antibiotics for treating A. baumannii infections; however, colistin-resistant strains are becoming increasingly common. This cationic antibiotic attacks negatively charged bacterial membranes in a manner similar to that seen with cationic antimicrobials of the innate immune system. We therefore set out to determine if the increasing use of colistin, and emergence of colistin-resistant strains, is concomitant with the generation of cross-resistance to host cationic antimicrobials. We found that there is indeed a positive correlation between resistance to colistin and resistance to the host antimicrobials LL-37 and lysozyme among clinical isolates. Importantly, isolates obtained before and after treatment of individual patients demonstrated that colistin use correlated with increased resistance to cationic host antimicrobials. These data reveal the overlooked risk of inducing cross-resistance to host antimicrobials when treating patients with colistin as a last-line antibiotic. IMPORTANCE Increased use of the cationic antibiotic colistin to treat multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has led to the development of colistin-resistant strains. Here we report that treatment of patients with colistin can induce not only increased resistance to colistin but also resistance to host cationic antimicrobials. This worrisome finding likely represents an example of a broader trend observed in other bacteria against which colistin is used therapeutically such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Furthermore, these data suggest that the possible future use of an array of cationic antimicrobial peptides in development as therapeutics may have unintended negative consequences, eventually leading to the generation of hypervirulent strains that are resistant to innate host defenses. The potential for the induction of cross-resistance to innate immune antimicrobials should be considered during the development of new therapeutics.
TI  - Intravenous colistin for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections in critically ill pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Nosocomial infection due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens in ICUs is a challenge for clinicians and microbiologists and has led to the resurgence of IV colistin use in the last decade. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of IV colistin in the treatment of critically ill children with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective descriptive study conducted in the PICU of Maulana Azad Medical College and associated Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, Delhi, India, during the period of January 2010 to December 2011. PATIENTS: The records of critically ill children with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections treated with IV colistin were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty critically ill children received IV colistin; their median age was 36 months (range: 1 mo-12 yr), with male:female ratio of 3:2. The isolated pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae. Mean duration of colistin therapy was 14.3 days (range, 7-21). A favorable clinical outcome occurred in 36 children (72%), and 14 children (28%) died due to severe sepsis with multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome. Renal toxicity occurred in five children and was associated with multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome in three and coadministration of vancomycin in two. No neurotoxic adverse effects due to colistin therapy were reported. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that IV colistin may have a role in the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in critically ill children, but further prospective and randomized control trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in children.
TI  - Nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia in Cuban intensive care units: bacterial species and antibiotic resistance.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nosocomial pneumonia associated with use of mechanical ventilators  is one of the greatest challenges confronted by intensivists worldwide. The literature associates several bacteria with this type of infection; most common in intensive care units are Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and some of the Enterobacteriaceae family. OBJECTIVES: To identify the causal agents of nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care units of Havana's Hermanos Ameijeiras Clinical-Surgical Teaching Hospital in 2011, and to characterize their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using hospital administrative data of quantitative cultures from positive tracheal aspirates for January through December, 2011. Records were analyzed from 77 intensive care unit patients who developed nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia. Variables examined were age and sex, and pathogens identified from culture of tracheal aspirate and related antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS Species most frequently isolated were: Acinetobacter baumannii in 53 patients (68.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 34 patients (44.2%), other species of Pseudomonas in 15 patients (19.5%), and Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli in 12 patients each (15.6%). Some patients presented more than one pathogen in concurrent or successive infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing found high percentages of resistance to antibiotics in all these pathogens. Least resistance was found to colistin. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria causing nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia is of concern. Colistin is the drug of choice among the antibiotics reviewed, but sensitivity to other antibiotics should be assessed to search for more appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics for treating nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia. Our results also suggest the need to strengthen infection control efforts, particularly in intensive care units, and to reassess compliance with quality control procedures. Multidisciplinary research involving microbiologists, epidemiologists, internists and intensivists is needed to fully understand the etiological and resistance patterns observed.
TI  - [Multiresistant Gram-negative bacterial infections: Enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and other non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - Multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria represent a major health problem worldwide. This is related to the severity of the infections they cause, the difficulties for empiric (even directed) treatment, the ease of multiresistance spread, and the absence of new antimicrobial agents active against this group of pathogens. Accordingly, antimicrobial therapy should be based on the results of susceptibility testing, and may require using antimicrobial combinations. The production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases represents the most important current problem of resistance among enterobacteria; these organisms cause nosocomial infections, but can also be cultured from non-hospitalised patients. In our country, enterobacteria producing plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes or most carbapenemases are still uncommon, at the moment. Enterobacteria expressing these types of beta-lactamases present high rates of resistance to aminoglycosides and quinolones, because plasmids coding for beta-lactamases also contain other genes involved in additional resistances and/or the selection of additional chromosomal mutations. Among multiresistant Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria, the most clinically relevant organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an organism with intrinsic resistance to multiple agents and with ability to capture acquired resistance mechanisms. Other organisms in the latter group include Acinetobacter baumannii, with increasing rates of resistance to antimicrobial agents, and to a lesser extent Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Frequency of microorganisms isolated in patients with bacteremia in intensive care units in Colombia and their resistance profiles.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the most frequently found bacterial microorganisms in bloodstream isolates taken from patients in intensive care units in Colombia and their resistance profiles. METHODS: This was a multicentre descriptive observational study that was carried out between January 2001 and June 2008 with laboratory data from 33 participating hospitals in a surveillance network. RESULTS: The most frequently found microorganisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococci 39.6%, Staphylococcus aureus 12.3%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 8.2%, Escherichia coli 5.7%, Acinetobacter baumannii, 4.0% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3.8%. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci registered greater than 70% oxacillin resistance rate. S. aureus presented a change in its multiresistance profile during the years of follow-up. There was a trend towards a lower resistance rate among E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates during the study period while A. baumannii carbapenem resistance rate exceeded 50%. DISCUSSION: There has been a change in the frequency of species being isolated with a higher frequency of enterobacteriaceae compared to Gram-positive microorganisms, in general with a high resistance rate.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in an Italian hospital.
AB  - The severity and extent of disease caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) varies by the population(s) affected and the institution(s) at which these organisms are found; therefore, preventing and controlling MDROs are extremely important. A retrospective study of patients who were infected with Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa was performed at the Spedali Civili Hospital in Brescia, Italy, from 2007 to 2010. A total of 167 (0.52%) A. baumannii isolates and 2797 P. aeruginosa (8.7%) isolates were identified among 31,850 isolates. Amikacin and colistin were the most active agents against A. baumannii strains. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in 57 isolates (54%). Most MDR isolates (42 out of 57, 73%) were resistant to four classes of antibiotics. P. aeruginosa was recovered more frequently from the respiratory tract, followed by the skin/soft tissue, urine and blood. Colistin, amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam were active against 100%, 86% and 75% of P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. A total of 20% (n=316) of P. aeruginosa isolates were MDR. In summary, A. baumannii was more rare than P. aeruginosa but was more commonly MDR. Epidemiological data will help to implement better infection control strategies, and developing a local antibiogram database will improve the knowledge of antimicrobial resistance patterns in our region.
TI  - The impact of early adequate antimicrobial therapy on 14-day mortality in patients with monomicrobial Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia.
AB  - The impact of colistin therapy for early adequate antimicrobial therapy on clinical outcomes has rarely been evaluated in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia (PAB) or Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia (ABB). We investigated the impact of early adequate antimicrobial therapy on 14-day mortality in 149 patients with monomicrobial PAB and ABB at two medical centers where colistin treatment was frequently used. Patients who survived the first 14 days of PAB/ABB received adequate antimicrobial therapy within 3 days of bacteremia more frequently than those who died (53.3 vs. 38.6%), although this finding is not statistically significant (p = 0.10). After excluding patients who received adequate colistin therapy, the difference was statistically significant (94.6 vs. 58.8%, p = 0.001). In a multiple regression model excluding patients who received colistin therapy, adequate antimicrobial therapy within 3 days of bacteremia was a preventive factor for 14-day mortality (adjusted OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.07-0.80, p = 0.02). In another multiple regression model including patients who received colistin, compared to inadequate antimicrobial therapy, adequate non-colistin therapy was a preventive factor for 14-day mortality (aOR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.07-0.78, p = 0.019), but adequate colistin therapy was not (aOR = 8.20, 95% CI = 1.07-62.90, p = 0.043). The favorable impact of early adequate antimicrobial therapy on 14-day mortality in patients with monomicrobial PAB/ABB may be lessened in the clinical practice of using colistin frequently. Further studies may be needed to evaluate the clinical impact of colistin therapy in patients with PAB or ABB.
TI  - A 4-year surveillance of device-associated nosocomial infections in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the rate of health care-associated infection (HC-AI) and device-associated health care-associated infections (DA-HAIs), and distribution of causative microorganisms and etiologic factors responsible for these infections in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a state hospital in southeastern Turkey. METHODS: A laboratory-based, active, prospective nosocomial infection surveillance study was performed in NICUs from January 2008 to December 2011. The rates of HC-AIs were determined on a daily basis. The findings were evaluated by applying the definitions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network. RESULTS: In a 4-year period, 580 HC-AIs, 81 of which were DA-HAIs, were detected among 6932 patients. The rate of hospital acquired infection was 8.3% and 7.69/1000 patient days. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was the second most frequent (13.1%) HC-AI and the most frequent was DA-HAI. The VAP rate was 6.4 per 1000 ventilator days. Mechanical ventilation was the most frequently used invasive device. Median time to diagnosis of VAP was 32.11 +/- 29.3 days from the time of admission. Acinetobacter baumannii (48%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32%) were the most frequent microorganisms. Colistin was the most effective antibiotic by in vitro test. The antibiotic resistance ratios of A. baumannii were >/=54% for carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and cefoperazone-sulbactam; >/=88% for quinolones; and >/=92% for ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam. CONCLUSIONS: Device-associated nosocomial infections was a particularly important problem in NICU. Close monitoring will decrease the rates of device-related nosocomial infections.
TI  - Risk factors for mortality in patients with nosocomial Gram-negative rod bacteremia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The percentage of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections associated with Gram-negative bacilles has decreased during last decade but it is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia, which is an important clinical problem with high mortality rates, and the risk factors for GNR related mortality in our Clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the study period, 520 episodes of bacteremia were detected in 411 patients. Only patients with GNR bacteremia in blood cultures were included in the study (n = 197). Among 197 patients fulfilling study criteria, GNR were grown in 239 samples. RESULTS: Escherichia coli (n = 97, 40.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 54, 22.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 24, 10%), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 24, 10%) were the most commonly isolated bacteria. The most frequently identified infection sources of bacteremia were pneumonia (n = 35, 17.7%), catheter-related infections (n = 24, 12.2%), urinary tract infections (n = 20, 10%). In multivariate analysis, it was found that the GNR bacteremia mortality risk increased in patients treated in intensive care units (ICU) (OR: 0.2, p = 0.03) and patients with ventilatory support (OR: 20.8, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice of the hospital settings, efforts should concentrate on preventive measures for nosocomial infections since pneumonia, catheter-related infections, and urinary infections appear to be the most frequent causes of secondary bacteremia.
TI  - [Investigation of the presence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) by PCR in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates].
AB  - Bacteria producing New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. This broad-spectrum resistance limits treatment options for infections caused by NDM-1 producers. NDM-1 was first isolated from an Indian patient in Sweden; since then, NDM-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including Turkey. In this study, we investigated the presence of NDM-1 by PCR method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in Samsun, Turkey. A total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 Acinetobacter baumannii, 54 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 Pseudomonas putida, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 3 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia rettgeri, 2 Escherichia coli and 1 Citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. Identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using Vitek-2 Compact (bioMerieux, France) and BD Phoenix (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD) automated systems. The results of antibiotic susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the CLSI recommendations. In our study, NDM-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by PCR. There was only one case study that reported the presence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates from Turkey [Poirel L et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2012;56:2784]. Our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates is not common in Turkey. However, since NDM-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. Therefore, continuous surveillance and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of NDM-1 may enable to identify NDM-1 producing isolates. Meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of NDM-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin in combination with low-dose colistin against a diverse collection of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The activity of colistin in combination with daptomycin was assessed using 30 Gram-negative type strains and multidrug-resistant isolates with defined mechanisms of resistance. Daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined with and without sub-inhibitory concentrations of colistin. The activity of daptomycin was not affected with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For colistin-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii, sensitisation factors ranged from 8 to 128 (median 32), with the daptomycin MIC being reduced to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) enterococci susceptibility breakpoint of 4 mug/ml for the ATCC 19606 type strain. A combination of daptomycin and colistin may be useful for the treatment of A. baumannii but not infections due to other Gram-negative species.
TI  - Continuous fluorescence anisotropy-based assay of BOCILLIN FL penicillin reaction with penicillin binding protein 3.
AB  - We report a simple, rapid, and reproducible fluorescence anisotropy-based method  for measuring rate constants for acylation and deacylation of soluble penicillin binding protein (PBP) constructs by compounds in microtiter plates by means of competition with time-dependent acylation by BOCILLIN FL. The method is demonstrated by measuring the acylation rate constants of the PBP3 periplasmic domains from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii by BOCILLIN FL, aztreonam, meropenem, and ceftazidime. The new method requires very little protein and can be completed in approximately 1h per compound. A set of BOCILLIN FL acylation progress curves collected over a range of competitor concentrations is fit globally to a kinetic model by numerical integration. First-order deacylation rate constants could also be measured, as demonstrated with a catalytically impaired mutant OXA-10 beta-lactamase.
TI  - Drug resistance patterns of bacteria isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia at Tehran hospitals during 2009-2011.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nosocomial pneumonia remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Surveillance programs play an important role in the identification of common etiologic agents and local patterns of antimicrobial resistance. METHODOLOGY: In this study we determined the frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia during 2009 to 2011. RESULTS: A total of 642 bacteria were isolated from 516 suspected samples. Acinetobacter baumannii (21.1%, n = 136), was the commonest isolated pathogen followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%, n = 112), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%, n = 102) and enterococci (8.4% n = 54). The most effective therapeutic agents against A. baumannii were polymyxin B (95.5% susceptible), ceftriaxone/tazobactam (72% susceptible) and levofloxacin (52.9% susceptible). Polymixin B (89.2% susceptible), ceftriaxone/tazobactam (89.2% susceptible) and piperacillin-tazobactam (80.3% susceptible) were found to be the most active agents against P. aeruginosa. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected among isolates of K. pneumoniae (45.4%) and E. coli (20.3%). Overall, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin resistant enterococci were 80.4% and 40.7% respectively. Linezolid was found to be the most active antibiotic against these pathogens. The etiology of 50% of the nosocomial infection cases was polymicrobial. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of ceftriaxone/tazobactam seems to be beneficial agent against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli isolated form respiratory tract infections. The results of our study can be used for guiding appropriate empiric therapy in this geographic region.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria collected from countries in Eastern Europe: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) 2004-2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) commenced in 2004 to longitudinally monitor global changes in bacterial susceptibility to a suite of antimicrobial agents. The current study examined the activity of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected across Eastern Europe between 2004 and 2010. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methodologies. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using CLSI interpretive criteria, and tigecycline susceptibility was established using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. This study included 10 295 Gram-negative and 4611 Gram-positive isolates from 42 centres. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were reported among 15.3% of Escherichia coli and 39.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; the highest rates were observed in Turkey (30.9%) and Bulgaria (53.8%), respectively. Imipenem-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae were identified only in Turkey. ESBL-positive E. coli were highly susceptible to imipenem (95.1%), meropenem (98.0%) and tigecycline (98.5%). Most antimicrobials showed poor activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vancomycin resistance was noted among 0.9% of Enterococcus faecalis and 11.7% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. High rates of susceptibility were reported for linezolid (99.7%) and tigecycline (100%) against E. faecium. One-quarter of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), with the highest rate in Romania (51.5%); all MRSA were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Antimicrobial resistance is high in much of Eastern Europe, with considerable variation seen among countries. Tigecycline and the carbapenems retain excellent activity against many pathogens from Eastern Europe; linezolid and vancomycin are active against most Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Dissemination of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and 16S rRNA methylases among acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the diversity of the genes encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) and their associations with resistance phenotypes and clonality in Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. METHODS: Seventy six P. aeruginosa and 75 A. baumannii isolates were collected from three University affiliated hospitals in Tehran. MIC determination of amikacin and gentamicin as well as the disk diffusion method for tobramycin, netilmicin, and kanamycin were carried out. Nine AMEs genes and three RNA methylases were investigated in all isolates using the PCR method. Clonality for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa was investigated using repetitive extragenic palindromic and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, respectively. RESULTS: aph(3')-VIa (90.6%) and aph(3')-IIb (61.8%) were the most prevalent AME genes in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Eight (26%) amikacin highly resistant A. baumannii isolates were positive for armA methylase. Phenotypes and clonality did not link to the genetic determinants of resistance to aminoglycosides in our isolates. CONCLUSIONS: AMEs genes are disseminated in different clones of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates in Iran. Other than AMEs, there are more complex and multifactorial mechanisms that result in aminoglycoside-resistant phenotypes.
TI  - The effect of alginate oligosaccharides on the mechanical properties of Gram-negative biofilms.
AB  - The influence of a novel, safe antibiofilm therapy on the mechanical properties of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii biofilms in vitro was characterized. A multiscale approach employing atomic force microscopy (AFM) and rheometry was used to quantify the mechanical disruption of the biofilms by a therapeutic polymer based on a low-molecular weight alginate oligosaccharide (OligoG). AFM demonstrated structural alterations in the biofilms exposed to OligoG, with significantly lower Young's moduli than the untreated biofilms, (149 MPa vs 242 MPa; p < 0.05), a decreased resistance to hydrodynamic shear and an increased surface irregularity (Ra) in the untreated controls (35.2 nm +/- 7.6 vs 12.1 nm +/- 5.4; p < 0.05). Rheology demonstrated that increasing clinically relevant concentrations of OligoG (<10%) were associated with an increasing phase angle (delta) over a wide range of frequencies (0.1-10 Hz). These results highlight the utility of these techniques for the study of three-dimensional biofilms and for quantifying novel disruption therapies in vitro.
TI  - The type, level, and distribution of microorganisms within the ward environment:  a zonal analysis of an intensive care unit and a gastrointestinal surgical ward.
AB  - OBJECTIVE. To investigate the distribution of hospital pathogens within general and critical care ward environments and to determine the most significant bacterial reservoirs within each ward type. DESIGN. Prospective 4-month microbiological survey. SETTING. The intensive care unit (ICU) and gastrointestinal (GI) surgical ward of a London teaching hospital. PATIENTS. Sampling was conducted in and around the bed space of 166 different patients (99 in the ICU and 67 in the GI ward). METHODS. Conventional agar contact methodology was used to sample 123 predetermined sites twice a week for 17 weeks. Sixty-one surfaces were located within the ICU, and 62 were located within the GI ward. Each surface was located within a theoretical zone of increasing distance from the patient. Aerobic colony counts were determined, and confirmatory testing was conducted on all presumptive pathogens. RESULTS. Regardless of ward type, surfaces located closest to the patient, specifically those associated with the bed (side rails, bed control, and call button), were the most heavily contaminated. Elsewhere, the type of surfaces contaminated differed with ward type. In the ICU, bacteria were most likely to be on surfaces that were regularly touched by healthcare workers (e.g., telephones and computer keyboards). In the GI ward, where the patients were mobile, the highest numbers of bacteria (including potential nosocomial pathogens) were on surfaces that were mainly touched by patients, particularly their toilet and shower facilities. CONCLUSIONS. In terms of cleaning, a hospital should not be considered a single entity. Different ward types should be treated as separate environments, and cleaning protocols should be adjusted accordingly.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance rates in causative agents of infections in diabetic patients: rising concerns.
AB  - The vicious cycle is that hyperglycemia (>/=11.1 mmol/l) or other diabetes-associated factors facilitate or worsen the development of infections and vice versa, the infections deteriorate the glycemic control of the patients. Diabetic patients are prone to some infections, infection recurrences and poor outcomes. Immunocompromised state and frequent antibiotic use are associated with antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (in some studies), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, bacteria in diabetic foot infections and different opportunistic and rare pathogens or multidrug-resistant strains. Prompt diagnostics and susceptibility testing, early and aggressive surgical and/or antibiotic therapy, and, importantly, good glycemic control are of utmost importance for treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections in diabetic patients.
TI  - Epidemiology of bacteremia caused by uncommon non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevalence of bacteremia caused by non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria (NFGNB) has been increasing over the past decade. Although many studies have already investigated epidemiology of NFGNB bacteremia, most focused only on common NFGNB including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii (AB). Knowledge of uncommon NFGNB bacteremia is very limited. Our study aimed to investigate epidemiology and identify factors associated with uncommon NFGNB bacteremia. METHODS: This observational study was conducted at a university hospital in Thailand during July 1, 2007-Dec 31, 2008. All patients who had at least one blood culture positive for NFGNB and met the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome within 24 hours before/after obtaining the blood culture were enrolled. The NFGNB isolates that could not be satisfactorily identified by the standard biochemical assays were further characterized by molecular sequencing methods. To identify factors associated with uncommon NFGNB bacteremia, characteristics of patients in the uncommon NFGNB group were subsequently compared to patients in the common NFGNB group (AB and PA bacteremia). RESULTS: Our study detected 223 clinical isolates of NFGNB in 221 unique patients. The major causative pathogens were AB (32.7%), followed by PA (27.8%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (5.4%), Acinetobacter lwoffii (4.9%) and Burkholderia pseudomallei (2.7%). Infection-related mortality was 63.0% in the AB group, 40.3% in the PA group and 17.4% in the uncommon NFGNB group. Factors associated with uncommon NFGNB bacteremia (OR [95% CI]; p-value) were male sex (0.28 [0.14-0.53]; p < 0.001), hospital-acquired infection (0.23 [0.11-0.51]; p < 0.001), recent aminoglycosides exposure 0.23 [0.06-0.8]; p = 0.01), primary bacteremia (6.43 [2.89-14.2]; p < 0.001]), catheter related infection (4.48 [1.54-13.06]; p < 0.001) and recent vancomycin exposure (3.88 [1.35-11.1]; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our distribution of causative pathogens was slightly different from other studies. The common NFGNB group had a remarkably higher ID-mortality than the uncommon NFGNB group. Knowledge of factors associated with uncommon NFGNB bacteremia would help physicians to distinguish between low vs. high risk patients.
TI  - Impact of ertapenem use on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii imipenem susceptibility rates: collateral damage or positive effect on hospital ecology?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conflicting evidence has been reported on the impact of ertapenem use on the susceptibility of Pseudomonas spp. to group 2 carbapenems. No extensive data for Acinetobacter baumannii are currently available. METHODS: A retrospective time-series segmented regression analysis was conducted in a tertiary centre from January 2001 to December 2011. Ertapenem was introduced in January 2005. Antimicrobial drug use was defined as the number of defined daily doses/100 patient-days (DDDs/100 PDs). Susceptibility (CLSI) was measured in terms of proportion and incidence density. RESULTS: Mean monthly use of imipenem was 2.9 +/- 0.9 DDDs/100 PDs, as compared with 1.2 +/- 0.7 DDDs/100 PDs for meropenem and 1.0 +/- 0.7 DDDs/100 PDs for ertapenem (after its introduction). After ertapenem adoption, a downward trend was seen in the use of imipenem (P = 0.016) and ciprofloxacin (P = 0.004). A total of 6272 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1093 A. baumannii isolates were evaluated. Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to imipenem improved after ertapenem introduction, both according to the proportion of susceptible isolates (P = 0.002) and to the incidence density of resistance (P </= 0.001). No significant change was seen in A. baumannii susceptibility to imipenem (P = 0.772). By multiple linear regression analysis, the incidence density of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa increased with the use of imipenem (P = 0.003) and ciprofloxacin (P = 0.008). Occurrence of outbreaks (P </= 0.001) and use of gentamicin (P = 0.007) were associated with A. baumannii resistance to imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: Use of ertapenem was directly associated with a downward trend in the use of imipenem and ciprofloxacin, which may have contributed to improve the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to imipenem. Ertapenem use had no impact on the susceptibility of A. baumannii to imipenem.
TI  - One-year surveillance of ESKAPE pathogens in an intensive care unit of Monterrey, Mexico.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial species from the ESKAPE group (i.e. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species) are frequently resistant to antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to monitor the incidence of ESKAPE pathogens at the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital in Monterrey, Mexico. METHODS: All clinically relevant organisms isolated from June 2011 to June 2012 were included. Identification and susceptibility testing was performed using panels from Sensititre. Resistance to oxacillin, for S. aureus, and the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), for K. pneumonia, were determined as defined by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. Also, the presence of vanA and vanB genes was determined in E. faecium vancomycin (VAN)-resistant isolates. RESULTS: The majority of pathogens (64.5%) isolated in the ICU unit were from the ESKAPE group. The organisms most frequently isolated were A. baumannii (15.8%) and P. aeruginosa (14.3%). A high resistance to carbapenems was detected for A. baumannii (75.3%) while 62% of S. aureus isolates were confirmed to be methicillin resistant. Of the K. pneumoniae isolates, 36.9% were ESBL producers. We detected three E. faecium VAN-resistant isolates, all of which contained the vanA gene. CONCLUSION: The presence of the ESKAPE group of pathogens is a major problem in the ICU setting. The results of this study support the implementation of special antimicrobial strategies to specifically target these microorganisms.
TI  - [Pathogen distribution and antibiotic resistance for hospital aquired pneumonia in respiratory medicine intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the change of pathogen distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from in-patients with hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the Department of Respiratory Medicine Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of Xiangya Hospital in 2005 and in 2011, and to provide reasonable anti-infectious strategy. METHODS: The positive susceptibility test of sputum (bronchial secretions) culture was done in patients with HAP in RICU of Xiangya Hospital in 2005 and in 2011, and the distribution feature and antibiotic resistance were compared. RESULTS: 1) In the two years, the main pathogen in HAP patients was Gram negative bacteria (infection rate was 68.07% and 65.21% in 2005 and in2011 respectively). The primary pathogenic bacteria were changed, and Acinetobacter baumanii became the most common Gram negative bacterium which replaced Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with infection rate 6.81% in 2005 to 40.87% in 2011. The infection rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduced from 20.42% in 2005 to 15.60% in 2011. Haemophilus influenzae was rare. Staphylococcus aureus became the primary Gram positive bacteria, and its infection rate increased from 1.57% in 2005 to 4.83% in 2011, all of which were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Saccharomyces albicans' positive culture rate increased significantly. 2) Compared with in 2005, the antibiotic resistance of pathogen isolated from the HAP pationts changed a lot in 2011: increased antibiotic resistance rate and decreased sensitivity to many antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was only relatively susceptible to meropenem, cefoperazone sulbactam, ceftazidime, cefpodoxime, and andamicaxin in 2011. The resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to levofloxacin, cyclopropane, amicacin, gentamicin, meropenem, cematrixone, and piperacilintazobactam increased obviously (P<0.05). Compared with 2005, Acinetobacter baumanii was totally susceptible to polymyxin and relatively susceptible to sulbactam, but it was almost completely resistant to Aminoglycoside antibiotics in 2011, with significant difference (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The main pathogen of HAP patients in RICU was Gram negative bacteria, with increased infection rate of Staphylococcus aureus and fungus. There is change pathogen distribution and antibiotic resistance, and the clinical initial experimental antibiotic therapy may be influenced. It is important to use antibiotics more rationally to delay the antibiotic resistance.
TI  - [Comparative study of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from burned patients during two periods (2005-2008, 2008-2011) and in two hospitals (Hospital Aziza Othmana, Trauma and Burn Center)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring of the bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance of the main bacteria involved in nosocomial infections helps improve treatment and prevention strategies. AIM: To compare the bacteriological profile and antibiotic susceptibility of the main bacterial isolates within the burned patients over two periods of 3 years and in two hospitals. METHODS: During two three-year periods: period 1 (P1): 1/7/2005-30/6/2008 and period 2 (P2): 1/7/2008-30/6/2011) and in two hospitals: Hospital Aziza Othmana (HAO) and the traumatology and burn center (CTGB), 2153 and 3719 non-repetitive strains were isolated from burn patients from different samples. The transfer of the intensive care unit was made on 01/07/2008 from the Hospital Aziza Othmana to CTGB. The study of antibiotic sensitivity was performed according to CA-SFM. RESULTS: During the period P1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the main bacteria isolated (18%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (12%). After the transfer of intensive care burn unit to the traumatology center, ecology bacterial varied with S. aureus (20%) in the first place followed by P. aeruginosa (15%) and Proteus mirabilis (11%). The study of the evolution of antibiotic susceptibility showed an overall downward trend of resistance in the second half of 2008, immediately after the transfer of service in the new hospital structure. The rate of ceftazidim resistant Klebsilella pneumoniae decreased from 80.4% to 50%, Similarly the resistance of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime and imipenem decreased respectively from 61% to 39.4% and from 63.3% to 37.1%. Nevertheless, the reduction of resistance was followed by a rapid increasing during the year 2009 to reach overall rates of resistance previously observed in the hospital Aziza Othmana. Concerning S. aureus, the rate of MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) showed no significant variation throughout the study period: 60% versus 56.3% at HAO and CTGB. A. baumannii brings up the problem of mutiresistance: 92.7% of strains were resistant to ceftazidime and 63.9% to imipenem during P1 with an emphasis on resistance to imipenem during P2 increased to 89.3%. CONCLUSION: Resistance is a problem in the intensive care burn unit. Preventive measures have to be taken.
TI  - Acinetobacter is the most common pathogen associated with late-onset and recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia in an adult intensive care unit in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The guidelines for initial empiric antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are highly dependent on the type of causative pathogen and the time of diagnosis. The objective of this study was to examine the microbial causes of VAP and describe any variability by the timing of VAP onset and over time. METHODS: A prospective surveillance study was conducted in the adult general intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Microbial isolates obtained from blood and different respiratory specimens of patients diagnosed with VAP (using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition) between August 2003 and June 2009 were included. RESULTS: A total of 457 pathogens were identified during the study; 380 (83.2%) were associated with primary VAP and 77 (16.8%) were associated with recurrent VAP. Of primary VAP pathogens, 159 (41.8%) were associated with early-onset (<5 days) and 221 (58.2%) were associated with late-onset (>/=5 days) VAP. The most common pathogen identified was Acinetobacter spp (26.5%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (15.3%), Klebsiella spp (6.8%), Haemophilus spp (6.1%), and Enterobacter spp (5.0%). Acinetobacter spp and MRSA were significantly associated with late-onset VAP while Haemophilus spp and Streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly associated with early-onset VAP. Acinetobacter spp was the only pathogen associated with recurrent VAP and its incidence showed a significant increasing trend during the study period. Acinetobacter spp was significantly associated with prolonged ventilation, sedation, and nasogastric intubation. CONCLUSIONS: Acinetobacter baumannii is the most common and increasingly important pathogen associated with VAP in our patients, especially late-onset and recurrent VAP.
TI  - Prevalence of blaPER-1 and integrons in ceftazidime-resistant Gram-negative bacteria at a university hospital in Turkey.
AB  - In this study, we examined the prevalence of the PER-1 enzyme and the presence of clinically important integron classes in ceftazidime-resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolated at a university hospital. The blaPER-1 gene was detected by PCR in 33 (19.5%) of the total 169 Gram-negative bacteria, including 17 (23.3%) of the 73 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and 16 (25%) of the 64 Acinetobacter baumannii complex isolates. Molecular fingerprinting revealed that blaPER-1 prevalence was mostly due to the dissemination of clonally related P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii complex strains. Class 1 integron (intI1) was detected in 52.7% of the 169 bacteria examined in this study. Its detection rates were estimated at 49.3% and 57.8% of the P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii complex strains isolated, respectively. It was also detected in 11 of the 16 Escherichia coli isolates and 5 of the 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. A single E. coli isolate and another K. pneumoniae isolate contained both class 1 and class 2 integrase genes. The results of this study revealed that clonally related blaPER-1-positive P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii complex strains, mostly harboring intI1, had disseminated at our hospital.
TI  - Carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important Gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in Taiwan: results from the Surveillance of Multicentre Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART) in 2009.
AB  - To investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in Taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and Burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. Susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 MIC breakpoints recommended by the CLSI as well as 2012 MIC breakpoints recommended by EUCAST. Based on CLSI 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, respectively. All Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii isolates were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of P. mirabilis and all M. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. Meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates. E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae with ertapenem MICs>/=4 mg/L were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. Imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, respectively. Additionally, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates with imipenem MICs>/=8 mg/L were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. These data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae as well as P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates with imipenem MICs>/=4 mg/L.
TI  - Potency and spectrum of activity of AN3365, a novel boron-containing protein synthesis inhibitor, tested against clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - AN3365 (MIC(50/90), 0.5/1 mug/ml) was active against Enterobacteriaceae, including a subset of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae strains (MIC(50/90), 1/2 mug/ml). AN3365 inhibited 98.0 and 92.2% of wild-type (MIC(50/90), 2/8 mug/ml) and carbapenem-resistant (MIC(50/90), 4/8 mug/ml) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, respectively, at </= 8 mug/ml. AN3365 also demonstrated activity against wild-type Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC(50/90), 2/8 mug/ml) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC(50/90), 2/4 mug/ml), while it was less active against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (MIC50/90, 8/16 mug/ml) and Burkholderia cepacia (MIC(50/90), 8/32 mug/ml).
TI  - Isolation and molecular characterization of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 producing superbug in Bangladesh.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamse-1 (NDM-1) producing superbugs create a global public health problem because of their resistance to most antibiotics. This study was conducted to determine the presence of MBL producers, including NDM-1 producers, in Bangladesh, along with the antimicrobial resistance patterns of these organisms. METHODOLOGY: Thirty-five isolates resistant to imipenem by disk diffusion technique were investigated for MBL production. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of imipenem was determined by agar dilution method. MBL producers were phenotypically detected by double disk synergy test and combined disk assay. Gene encoding blaIMP-1, blaIMP-2, blaVIM-1, blaVIM-2, blaNDM-1 and class 1 integron was identified by PCR. RESULTS: Thirty-one (88.57%) MBL producers were detected by PCR, 24 (68.57%) by double disk synergy test, and 30 (85.71%) by combined disk assay. Eight (22.86%) were positive for blaNDM-1, 13 (37.15%) for blaVIM-1, 21 (60.00%) for blaVIM-2, 18 (51.43%) for blaIMP-1, and 9 (25.71%) for blaIMP-2. More than one blaMBL was present in 23 (65.71%) of the isolates. MIC of imipenem of MBL producers ranged from >/=256 microg/ml to </=8 microg/ml. All the NDM-1 producing isolates carried class 1 integron. NDM-1 producers were 100% resistant to amoxicillin, cephradine, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, gentamicin and piperacillin, 87.5% to amikacin, 75% to ciprofloxacin, and 62.5% to co-trimoxazole and the combination of tazobactam and piperacillin. All were sensitive to colistin. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide insight into the presence of blaMBL, including blaNDM-1, in Bangladesh. Urgent epidemiological monitoring of MBL producers in Bangladesh may combat their rapid dissemination.
TI  - Factors influencing the early mortality in haematological malignancy patients with nosocomial Gram negative bacilli bacteraemia: a retrospective analysis of 154 cases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to assess the factors influencing the early  mortality (7-day after index blood culture) in haematological malignancy patients with Gram negative bacilli (GNB) bacteraemia. METHODS: Infection control committee records were reviewed to identify the cases between March 2006 and June 2011. Only one bacteraemic episode per patient was included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 154 patients with GNB bacteraemia were identified. The early mortality rate was 19.5% (30 out of 154). Blood cultures revealed Enterobacteriacea in 120 patients (Escherichia coli; 86, Klebsiella spp.; 28, Enterobacter cloacea; 6) and glucose non-fermenting GNB in 34 patients (Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 15, Acinetobacter baumannii; 11, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; 7, Burkholderia cepacia; 1). Forty (33.3%) out of 120 Enterobacteriaceae were extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and 18 (52.9%) out of 34 glucose non-fermenting GNB were multidrug resistant. Carbapenems were administered as first line therapy in 139 out of 154 patients. In univariate analysis Pitt's bacteraemia score, presence of aplastic anaemia, bacteraemia caused by glucose non-fermentating GNB, inappropriate empirical antibacterial treatment, presence of severe sepsis or septic shock, unable to achieve microbiological cure, and intensive care unit (ICU) acquired bacteraemia were associated with mortality. Multivariate analysis showed ICU acquired bacteraemia (OR, 12.55; 95% CI, 2.34-67.38, p=0.003) as an independent factor associated with early mortality. CONCLUSION: Haematological malignancy patients who require ICU care are at high risk for early mortality related to GNB bacteraemia. Based on the local findings pointing out high rate of multidrug resistance, carbapenems combined with colistin seems to be a reasonable approach as empirical treatment of these patients. However, increasing carbapenem resistance rate is of concern.
TI  - Late respiratory infection after lung transplantation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aiming to improve outcome of lung transplantation (LTx) patients, we  reviewed risk factors and treatment practices for the LTx recipients who experienced respiratory infection in the late post-LTx period (>1 month after LTx). METHODS: We analyzed the clinical data of 48 recipients and donors from 61 LTx, who experienced late respiratory infections. Late respiratory infections were classified according to the etiology, time of occurrence, and frequency of donor-to-host transmission or colonization of the recipient prior to transplantation. RESULTS: During the period of observation, 42 episodes of respiratory infections occurred. The organisms most frequently involved were gram (-) bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii (n=13, 31.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=7, 16.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=4, 10.0%). Among the 42 episodes recorded, 14 occurred in the late post-LTx period. These were bacterial (n=6, 42.9%), fungal (n=2, 14.3%), viral (n=4, 28.5%), and mycobacterial (n=2, 14.3%) infections. Of 6 bacterial infections, 2 were from multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii and one from each of MDR P. aeruginosa, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (+) K. pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Infection-related death occurred in 6 of the 14 episodes (43%). CONCLUSION: Although the frequency of respiratory infection decreased sharply in the late post-LTx period, respiratory infection was still a major cause of mortality. Gram (-) MDR bacteria were the agents most commonly identified in these infections.
TI  - Emerging resistance problems and future perspectives in pharmacotherapy for complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common infectious diseases and contribute to high financial burden worldwide. Administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy is the key to achieving good therapeutic outcomes. The authors review the current status of global or regional epidemiology, especially on the antimicrobial resistance and several potential agents against complicated UTIs by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. AREAS COVERED: The authors summarized the susceptibility status on several major surveillance programs on uropathogens, focusing on Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Besides, the current perspectives of several potential antimicrobials against MDR uropathogens available for UTIs were also reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: High resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially to extended-spectrum beta-lactams, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones among uropathogens emerges as a critical problem in many countries. Appropriate antimicrobial stewardship and continuous surveillance are necessary to monitor the trends of susceptibility for main pathogens. For these MDR uropathogens, polymyxin, fosfomycin, tigecycline, nitrofurantoin, linezolid, and daptomycin might be potential treatments for patients with uncomplicated and complicated UTIs in some countries, although they might not be approved by their regulation. However, more clinical evidence and more extensive meta-analyses are needed to evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of their usage in countries with a high prevalence of multidrug resistance.
TI  - Clinical relevance of the ESKAPE pathogens.
AB  - In recent years, the Infectious Diseases Society of America has highlighted a faction of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) - acronymically dubbed 'the ESKAPE pathogens' - capable of 'escaping' the biocidal action of antibiotics and mutually representing new paradigms in pathogenesis, transmission and resistance. This review aims to consolidate clinically relevant background information on the ESKAPE pathogens and provide a contemporary summary of bacterial resistance, alongside pertinent microbiological considerations necessary to face the mounting threat of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus- the predominant pathogen in the neonatal ICU of a tertiary care hospital in amritsar, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An early treatment and the appropriate and the rational use of antibiotics would minimize the risk of severe morbidity and mortality in neonatal sepsis, and reduce the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms in intensive care units. For the success of an early empiric treatment, a periodic review of the cases to assess any changing trends in the infecting organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility is important. AIM: To study the most commonly encountered bacterial pathogens which caused neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity patterns, so that guidelines could be prepared for a rational antibiotic therapy. SETTING AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective study which was conducted in the Department of Microbiology and the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at SGRDIMSAR, Amritsar, during June 2011 to June 2012. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Blood specimens for culture were drawn from 311 newborns who were admitted in an NICU with sepsis. The specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. Subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. The isolates were identified by doing standard biochemical tests. The antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolates were studied by the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: A total of 131 organisms were isolated from the 311 blood cultures. These included Staphylococcus aureus (n=68), Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (n=30), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=10), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=9), Escherichia coli (n=05), Enterobacter cloacae (n=04), Citrobacter diversus (n=02), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=02) and Candida (n=01). Staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen in both early and late-onset sepsis. On antibiotic sensitivity testing, 57.35% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. More than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to amikacin. The resistance to the third generation cephalosporins varied between 50-55%. The resistance to ciprofloxacin was quite high; however, most of the isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin. A majority of the isolates were susceptible to piperacillin- tazobactum and imipenem. CONCLUSION: The present study emphasized the importance of periodic surveys on the microbial flora which was encountered in particular neonatal settings to recognize the trend.
TI  - Activity of BAL30072 alone or combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors or with meropenem against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated the activity of BAL30072, a dihydroxypyridone monosulfactam, against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters (i) alone, (ii) combined with BAL29880 (to inhibit AmpC) and/or clavulanate [to inhibit extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)] and (iii) combined 1:1 with meropenem. METHODS: Isolates were from multiple UK hospitals. MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution. Carbapenemases were identified by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: BAL30072 inhibited 69% of the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae at </=4 mg/L, including 60%-87% with OXA-48, IMP, NDM and VIM enzymes or combinations of impermeability with AmpC or ESBL, and 40% with KPC enzymes. The proportions susceptible exceeded 90% for BAL30072+BAL29880+clavulanate, except for isolates with KPC carbapenemases, where members of the international sequence type (ST) 258 Klebsiella pneumoniae clone remained resistant. At 4 mg/L, BAL30072 was active against all OprD-deficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa, against 8/12 with efflux-type beta-lactam resistance and 19/25 with metallo-carbapenemases; these proportions were little increased if inhibitors were added. Most Acinetobacter baumannii with OXA or NDM carbapenemases were susceptible to BAL30072 alone at </=4 mg/L, but those with OXA-58 were resistant, probably for reasons other than their beta-lactamase. Addition of meropenem to BAL30072 increased activity against some individual isolates, but with little clear relationship to the resistance mechanism, except for consistent potentiation against OprD-deficient P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: BAL30072 had good activity against many diverse carbapenem resistance types. Adding clavulanate and/or BAL29880 extended activity against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, but not non-fermenters. Adding meropenem resulted in small increases in activity against individual isolates. Resistance remained common in the K. pneumoniae ST258 KPC clone, even with both inhibitors or meropenem added.
TI  - Population pharmacokinetic analysis of colistin in burn patients.
AB  - Colistin is increasingly used as a salvage therapy for nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. However, the available pharmacokinetic (PK) data for colistin are limited to guide dosing. The aim of this study was to develop a population PK model of colistin and to identify the optimal dosage regimens for burn patients. Fifty patients with burns ranging from 4% to 85% of total body surface area who had been treated with colistimethate sodium (CMS) were studied. CMS, which is hydrolyzed in vivo to an active metabolite, was intravenously administered every 12 h. Blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after more than five infusions to measure the colistin concentration using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system. The population PK model was developed using nonlinear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM, v. 6.2). A one-compartment linear PK model for colistin best described the data. The covariates included in the final model were creatinine clearance for the relative fraction of CMS converted into colistin and the presence of edema for the turnover rate constant of CMS converted into colistin. A steady-state 24-h area under the concentration-time curve was simulated from 1,000 virtual patients receiving 150 mg colistin base activity every 12 h using the final model. Relative to previous studies with critically ill patients, the elimination half-life of colistin (6.6 h) was much shorter, and continuous renal replacement therapy was not a significant covariate for any PK parameters.
TI  - Non-nucleoside inhibitors of BasE, an adenylating enzyme in the siderophore biosynthetic pathway of the opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Siderophores are small-molecule iron chelators produced by bacteria and other microorganisms for survival under iron limiting conditions such as found in a mammalian host. Siderophore biosynthesis is essential for the virulence of many important Gram-negative pathogens including Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. We performed high-throughput screening against BasE, which is involved in siderophore biosynthesis in A. baumannii, and identified 6-phenyl-1-(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-4-carboxylic acid 15. Herein we report the synthesis, biochemical, and microbiological evaluation of a systematic series of analogues of the HTS hit 15. Analogue 67 is the most potent analogue with a KD of 2 nM against BasE. Structural characterization of the inhibitors with BasE reveals that they bind in a unique orientation in the active site, occupying all three substrate binding sites, and thus can be considered as multisubstrate inhibitors. These results provide a foundation for future studies aimed at increasing both enzyme potency and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Novel derivatives of polymyxins.
AB  - Polymyxin B and colistin (polymyxin E) are bactericidal pentacationic lipopeptides that act specifically on Gram-negative bacteria, first by disrupting their outermost permeability barrier, the outer membrane (OM), and then damaging the cytoplasmic membrane. Both were discovered in the mid-1950s and subsequently used in intravenous therapy, but soon largely abandoned because of nephrotoxicity. The emergence of extremely multiresistant strains has now forced clinicians to reinstate them in the therapy of severe infections caused by such strains. This article reviews recent attempts to develop novel derivatives of polymyxins that exhibit less toxicity and greater potency than the existing drugs. In addition, studies of novel des-fatty acyl-polymyxin derivatives that display activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa are included. The review also covers recent studies of derivatives that lack potent bactericidal action, but which disrupt the OM, which increases bacterial permeability to other antibiotics, facilitating their entry into the cell.
TI  - [Copper activity against multiresistant Gram negative bacilli isolated from Chilean hospitals].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multiresistant nosocomial pathogens, especially Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), are a serious problem for public health systems worldwide. Due to their antimicrobial properties, copper alloys have been suggested as an alternative for the control of bacterial burden in surfaces in hospital environment. However, antibiotic multiresistance and copper resistance could be associated in GNB, and there is evidence that both kind of resistance genes (antibiotic and copper) can be located on the same genetic structures. For this reason antibiotic-multiresistant strains could survive in the presence of copper, selecting for bacterial phenotypes resistant to both antibacterial agents. AIM: To evaluate antibacterial activity of copper against nosocomial extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) (+) and ESBL (-) GNB, and carbapenems resistant or susceptible strains. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This study included 390 strains of GNB isolated from Chilean hospitals: Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant (CAR R) and susceptible (CAR S) to carbapenem antibiotics, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli producers and non-producers of ESBL. Susceptibility levels to cupric sulphate were determined by agar dilution method and statistical analysis were used to determine the significance of the differences in the copper tolerance levels between the strains groups. RESULTS: Statistically superior copper tolerance levels were found in the CAR R and ESBL producing strains of A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, in relation with the CAR S and ESBL not-producing strains. CONCLUSION: A relation between a diminished susceptibility to ionic copper and to recent generation antimicrobial agents was observed in K. pneumoniae y A. baumannii strains.
TI  - Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria: how to prioritize infection prevention and control interventions in resource-limited settings?
AB  - Emergences of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB) have heightened global awareness of the prioritization of infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions to minimize infections attributed to these bacteria. Effective new antibiotic drugs for CRGNB are estimated to be at least 5 years off completion of trials and approval for use. Hence, effective IPC strategies remain at the core of clinical care and research for patients with CRGNB infection.

AB  - We studied the production of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) in Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to imipenem at the Rabat Mohammed V military teaching hospital, according to Yong et al.'s method, using a sterilized solution of EDTA 0.5 M pH 8. One hundred and five bacterial strains (48 A. baumannii and 57 P. aeruginosa) were identified. 45 (42.9%) with 34 A. baumannii and 11 P. aeruginosa were resistant to imipenem. The prevalence of MBL producing strains was 22.2% (10/45). The existence of this isolates resistant to imipenem by producing metallo-beta-lactamases is an emerging public health problem. It is necessary to implemente infection control programs to avoid spreading of multidrug resistant bacteria.
TI  - Effectiveness of flexible gastrointestinal endoscope reprocessing.
AB  - The practice of reprocessing endoscopes and its effectiveness was evaluated in 37 services. Contamination of at least 1 endoscope could be identified in 34 (91.6%) of 37 services. Bacteria, fungi, and/or mycobacteria were isolated from 84.6% (33/39) of the colonoscopes (110-32,000 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) and from 80.6% (50/62) of the gastroscopes (100-33,000 CFUs/mL). Not all services followed recommended guidelines. Therefore, patients who underwent gastrointestinal endoscopies were exposed to diverse pathogens.
TI  - Molecular viability testing of bacterial pathogens from a complex human sample matrix.
AB  - Assays for bacterial ribosomal RNA precursors (pre-rRNA) have been shown to distinguish viable from inactivated bacterial cells in drinking water samples. Because the synthesis of pre-rRNA is rapidly induced by nutritional stimulation, viable bacteria can be distinguished from inactivated cells and free nucleic acids by measuring the production of species-specific pre-rRNA in samples that have been briefly stimulated with nutrients. Here, pre-rRNA analysis was applied to bacteria from serum, a human sample matrix. In contrast to drinking water, serum is rich in nutrients that might be expected to mask the effects of nutritional stimulation. Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays were used to detect pre-rRNA of four bacterial species: Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. These species were chosen for their clinical significance and phylogenetic diversity (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria). To maximize resolving power, pre-rRNA was normalized to genomic DNA of each pathogen. When viable cells were shifted from serum to bacteriological culture medium, rapid replenishment of pre-rRNA was always observed. Cells of P. aeruginosa that were inactivated in the presence of serum exhibited no pre-rRNA response to nutritional stimulation, despite strong genomic DNA signals in these samples. When semi-automated methods were used, pre-rRNA analysis detected viable A. baumannii cells in serum at densities of </=100 CFU/mL in <5.5 hours. Originally developed for rapid microbiological analysis of drinking water, ratiometric pre-rRNA analysis can also assess the viability of bacterial cells derived from human specimens, without requiring bacteriological culture.
TI  - [Epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of clinical isolates about hospital infection from patients with hematological diseases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of isolates  from hospitalized patients with hematological disease from 2005 to 2011. METHODS: A total of 1453 bacterial strains were isolated from patients with hematological disease from January 2005 to December 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by micro-dilution method. RESULTS: (1) The majority of the bacterial strains were respiratory passage examples (57.5%). The portage of blood examples in our division (13.60%) was higher than of whole hospital (6.26%), with lower positive rate of bacterial culture (52.37%) than of whole hospital (60.24%). Chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis was the main reason for hospital infection. 578 (39.8%) bacterial strains were gram positive, and 875 (60.2%) gram negative bacillus. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. (2) Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 72.8% antibiotic resistance. Detection rates of ESBLs in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9% and 10.4%, respectively. (3) No obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were observed during these years. The Enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to Carbapenems, next to Cefoperazone/sulbactam and Piperacillin/tazobactam. But the resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to Cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems increased. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. The resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems were gradually increasing in the past years.
TI  - Epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance among commonly encountered bacteria associated with infections and colonization in intensive care units in a university-affiliated hospital in Shanghai.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to classify intensive care unit (ICU) bacterial strains as either ICU-acquired or ICU-on-admission and to compare their epidemiological and antibiogram characteristics. METHODS: The study was performed in a 1300-bed university-affiliated hospital from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2010. Based on the time of ICU admission, ICU isolates were classified as ICU-acquired strains (appearing more than 48 hours after admission) or ICU-on-admission strains (appearing 48 hours or less from admission). The microbiological data before ICU admission, the microbiological data, and susceptibility testing were compared between the ICU-acquired and ICU-on-admission bacterial isolates. RESULTS: The most common ICU-acquired strains were Acinetobacter baumannii (19.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (11.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.7%), Enterococcus spp. (10.6%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.7%). There were significant differences between ICU-acquired and ICU-on-admission isolates in the susceptibility rates of Gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics, especially the susceptibility of A. baumannii to imipenem [23.8% (ICU-acquired) vs. 44.4% (ICU-on-admission), p < 0.001] and meropenem (24.1% vs. 37.8%, p < 0.001), and the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to imipenem (39.3% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001) and meropenem (58.5% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, decreased susceptibility rates of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa to carbapenems were correlated with an extended ICU stay (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Because of decreasing susceptibility rates of pathogens (especially ICU-acquired strains) and a significant correlation with the length of ICU stay, intensivists should consider a patient's time of ICU admission and previous microbiological data and should distinguish ICU-acquired strains from non-ICU-acquired strains so as to initiate optimized empirical antibiotic therapy against ICU-acquired infections.
TI  - Biofilm formation by clinical isolates and the implications in chronic infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilm formation is a major virulence factor contributing to the chronicity of infections. To date few studies have evaluated biofilm formation in infecting isolates of patients including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) species in the context of numerous types of infectious syndromes. Herein, we investigated the biofilm forming capacity in a large collection of single patient infecting isolates and compared the relationship between biofilm formation to various strain characteristics. METHODS: The biofilm-forming capacity of 205 randomly sampled clinical isolates from patients, collected from various anatomical sites, admitted for treatment at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) from 2004-2011, including methicillin-resistant/methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/MSSA) (n=23), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=53), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=36), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=54), and Escherichia coli (n=39), were evaluated for biofilm formation using the high-throughput microtiter plate assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Relationships between biofilm formation to clonal type, site of isolate collection, and MDR phenotype were evaluated. Furthermore, in patients with relapsing infections, serial strains were assessed for their ability to form biofilms in vitro. RESULTS: Of the 205 clinical isolates tested, 126 strains (61.4%) were observed to form biofilms in vitro at levels greater than or equal to the Staphylococcus epidermidis, positive biofilm producing strain, with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus having the greatest number of biofilm producing strains. Biofilm formation was significantly associated with specific clonal types, the site of isolate collection, and strains positive for biofilm formation were more frequently observed to be MDR. In patients with relapsing infections, the majority of serial isolates recovered from these individuals were observed to be strong biofilm producers in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate biofilm formation in a large collection of infecting clinical isolates representing diverse types of infections. Our results demonstrate: (1) biofilm formation is a heterogeneous property amongst clinical strains which is associated with certain clonal types, (2) biofilm forming strains are more frequently isolated from non-fluid tissues, in particular bone and soft tissues, (3) MDR pathogens are more often biofilm formers, and (4) strains from patients with persistent infections are positive for biofilm formation.
TI  - Recent trends in resistance to cell envelope-active antibacterial agents among key bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cell envelope-active agents, particularly beta-lactams, play a pivotal role in the treatment of bacterial infections and the extent to which their activity is affected by the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms is of concern. We analyzed the Surveillance Network (TSN) database to evaluate resistant trends for key cell envelope-active drugs among ESKAPE pathogens. Analysis demonstrated that the activity of these drugs has been notably influenced by the emergence of multidrug resistance; this was especially evident for the beta-lactam drugs. For example, Acinetobacter baumannii resistance to imipenem increased from 23.9% to 34.3%, and resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam increased from 37.0% to 49.7% between 2007 and 2011. During the same time period Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to imipenem increased from 0.8% to 3.8%. As beta-lactams are a cornerstone of anti-infective therapy, it is important to closely monitor the activity of the agents being used today and to aggressively pursue new strategies that can augment current drugs and thwart ever-emerging beta-lactam resistance mechanisms that are continuously encountered.
TI  - Increasing the antibacterial activity of gentamicin in combination with extracted polyphosphate from Bacillus megaterium.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this research was production of polyphosphate (poly P) and study on its antibacterial effects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Poly P granules in the cells were observed with the help of Albert staining and extracted by Mussig-Zufika method. Thin layer chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31) P NMR) were used to characterize properties of these granules. Relation of phosphorus consumption and poly P production with growth was determined by the vanado-molybdate colorimetric method. Among the 60 strains of bacteria isolated from the environmental samples, strain G11 showed ability for the formation of high levels of poly P. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this isolate had 98% similarity with Bacillus megaterium. 16S rRNA sequence of isolate was deposited in GenBank with accession number JX115009. The average poly P chain length was 10.5 in this bacterium. The antimicrobial activity of bacterial extracted poly P was much better than chemical poly P, and its interaction with gentamicin increased the activity of this drug. The best synergistic activity of this interaction was observed for Corynebacterium glutamicum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa species. The highest adsorption of phosphorus occurred in stationary phase of growth curve, and then the amount of phosphorus increased in medium by degradation of stored poly P. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we isolated a high-level producer bacterium of poly P and extracted poly P by chemical treatment. In addition, we compared antimicrobial activity of chemical poly P with bacterial poly P and its interaction with gentamicin against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Many studies have shown that bacteria are becoming resistant to gentamicin sulphate. In this study, we approved that Acinetobacter baumannii, a pathogenic gentamicin-resistant bacterium, is sensitive to bacterial poly P, and thus, this poly P can be substituted for gentamicin in treatment.
TI  - Suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppuration (SUP) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. The aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with SUP in patients with chronic (CP) and aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 156 patients with CP and 66 with AgP were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). The counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. Comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Associations between frequency of SUP and bacterial species were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of SUP in patients with CP was 24.4%, and in patients with AgP it was 30.3%, and the percentage of SUP sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (P >0.05). SUP sites from patients with CP had significantly higher counts of Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella nigrescens than SUP sites from patients with AgP (P <0.005). Significant positive correlations between high frequency of SUP and high levels of Actinomyces spp, Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with CP (P <0.05). In patients with AgP, Actinomyces oris, Propionibacterium acnes, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with SUP, whereas Prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with SUP (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUP sites from patients with CP harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than SUP sites from patients with AgP. Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, T. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with SUP.
TI  - Ventilator associated pneumonia in a medical intensive care unit: Microbial aetiology, susceptibility patterns of isolated microorganisms and outcome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common complication of ventilatory support for patients with acute respiratory failure and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was undertaken to do quantitative cultures of aerobic bacteria, perform the antibiotic susceptibility testing from the endotracheal aspirates and clinical outcome of the clinically suspected patients of VAP. METHODS: A prospective study was performed over a period of one year in a tertiary care hospital, enrolling patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) for >/=48 hr. Endotracheal aspirates (ETA) were collected from patients with suspected VAP, and direct gram's stain criteria was used to accept the sample. Quantitative cultures of ETA were performed with the threshold for microbiological diagnosis of VAP was taken as >/=10(5) colony forming units (cfu)/ml. RESULTS: Out of 53 cases, 2 (3.77%) were polymicrobial. Multidrug resistant bacteria, mainly Acinetobacter baumannii 49.09% (27/55) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 30.91% (17/55) were the most common pathogens isolated. Metallo-beta lactamases (MBLs) was produced by 47.06% (8/17) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 62.96% (17/27) of Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: The bacteriological approach for the management of VAP helps the clinicians in choosing the appropriate antibiotics. This study showed that quantitative cultures of endotracheal aspirate at a cutoff point of 10(5) cfu/ml is one of the alternative to bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of clinically suspected ventilator associated pneumonia.
TI  - Emergence of imipenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli in intestinal flora of intensive care patients.
AB  - Intestinal flora contains a reservoir of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) resistant to cephalosporins, which are potentially pathogenic for intensive care unit (ICU) patients; this has led to increasing use of carbapenems. The emergence of carbapenem resistance is a major concern for ICUs. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess the intestinal carriage of imipenem-resistant GNB (IR-GNB) in intensive care patients. For 6 months, 523 consecutive ICU patients were screened for rectal IR-GNB colonization upon admission and weekly thereafter. The phenotypes and genotypes of all isolates were determined, and a case control study was performed to identify risk factors for colonization. The IR-GNB colonization rate increased regularly from 5.6% after 1 week to 58.6% after 6 weeks in the ICU. In all, 56 IR-GNB strains were collected from 50 patients: 36 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 12 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 6 Enterobacteriaceae strains, and 2 Acinetobacter baumannii strains. In P. aeruginosa, imipenem resistance was due to chromosomally encoded resistance (32 strains) or carbapenemase production (4 strains). In the Enterobacteriaceae strains, resistance was due to AmpC cephalosporinase and/or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production with porin loss. Genomic comparison showed that the strains were highly diverse, with 8 exceptions (4 VIM-2 carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa strains, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, and 2 S. maltophilia strains). The main risk factor for IR-GNB colonization was prior imipenem exposure. The odds ratio for colonization was already as high as 5.9 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.5 to 25.7) after 1 to 3 days of exposure and increased to 7.8 (95% CI, 2.4 to 29.8) thereafter. In conclusion, even brief exposure to imipenem is a major risk factor for IR-GNB carriage.
TI  - Comparison of the bacterial etiology of early-onset and late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia in subjects enrolled in 2 large clinical studies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is classified as early-onset or late-onset, in part, to identify subjects at risk for infection with resistant pathogens. We assessed differences in the bacterial etiology of early-onset versus late-onset VAP. METHODS: Subjects enrolled in 2004-2006 in 2 clinical studies of doripenem versus imipenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, with a diagnosis of VAP (n = 500) were included in the analysis. Subjects were classified by ventilator status: early-onset VAP (< 5 d of ventilation) or late-onset VAP (>/= 5 d of ventilation). Baseline demographics and bacterial etiology were analyzed by VAP status. RESULTS: Late-onset VAP subjects had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores (mean 16.6 versus 15.5, P = .008). There were no significant differences in Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score, sex, age, or presence of bacteremia between the groups. A total of 496 subjects had a baseline pathogen, and 50% of subjects in each group had >/= 2 pathogens. With the exception of Staphylococcus aureus, which was common in early-onset VAP, the pathogens (including potentially multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens) isolated from early-onset versus late-onset VAP were not significantly different between groups. Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa with decreased susceptibility to any study drug was observed in early-onset and late-onset VAP subjects. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the prevalence of potential MDR pathogens associated with early-onset or late-onset VAP, even in subjects with prior antibiotics. Empiric therapy for early-onset VAP should also include agents likely to be effective for potential MDR pathogens. Further prospective studies should evaluate microbiology trends in subjects with VAP.
TI  - [Clinical analysis of 105 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia after heart surgery].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the related factors and pathogens of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) after heart surgery. METHODS: VAP was diagnosed in 105 patients out of 1688 cases (6.2%) who underwent heart surgery in our department between January 2004 and January 2011. Clinical data, pathogens and treatments were analyzed. RESULTS: Incidence of VAP was 6.2% (105/1688), and 53.0% (105/198) in patients who required more than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. One hundred and ninety-eight pathogen strains were isolated by bacterial culture, in which Gram negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% (137/198), Gram positive bacteria 27.8% (55/198), and fungi for 3.0% (6/198). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were the main pathogens of VAP. The independent risk factors for VAP were: age > 70 years, emergent surgery, perioperative transfusions, reintubation and days of mechanical ventilation (all P < 0.01). Median length of stay in the ICU for patients who developed VAP or not was (24.7 +/- 4.5) days versus (3.2 +/- 1.5) days, respectively (P < 0.05) and in-hospital mortality was 25.7% (27/105) versus 2.9% (46/1583) respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing heart surgery have a high frequency of developing VAP, especially in patients that require more than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. VAP is associated with high in-hospital mortality. Age > 70 years, emergent surgery, perioperative transfusions, reintubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation use are independent risk factors for VAP in patients following cardiac surgery. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus are the main pathogens of VAP.
TI  - Pyrrolopyrimidine inhibitors of DNA gyrase B (GyrB) and topoisomerase IV (ParE),  Part II: development of inhibitors with broad spectrum, Gram-negative antibacterial activity.
AB  - The structurally related bacterial topoisomerases DNA gyrase (GyrB) and topoisomerase IV (ParE) have long been recognized as prime candidates for the development of broad spectrum antibacterial agents. However, GyrB/ParE targeting antibacterials with spectrum that encompasses robust Gram-negative pathogens have not yet been reported. Using structure-based inhibitor design, we optimized a novel pyrrolopyrimidine inhibitor series with potent, dual targeting activity against GyrB and ParE. Compounds were discovered with broad antibacterial spectrum, including activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli. Herein we describe the SAR of the pyrrolopyrimidine series as it relates to key structural and electronic features necessary for Gram-negative antibacterial activity.
TI  - [Adult hospital acquired pneumonia: a multicenter study on microbiology and clinical characteristics of patients from 9 Chinese cities].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiology and clinical characteristics of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in China and to provide evidence for appropriate therapy. METHODS: We performed a prospective multicenter study in 13 Chinese urban tertiary hospitals. All HAP cases diagnosed at respiratory general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) from August 2008 to December 2010 were studied. Epidemiological data, etiology and clinical characteristics of enrolled patients were collected. Sputum or tracheal aspirate and blood cultures, Legionella antibodies and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen tests were performed. Bacteria to antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed. RESULTS: A total of 610 cases of HAP were diagnosed during the study, with an overall incidence of 1.4% among 42 877 hospitalized patients, while the incidence was 0.9% (362/41 261) in respiratory general ward and 15.4% (248/1616) in RICU. 93.9% (573 cases) of patients had at least one underlying disease, and 91.0% (555 cases) had exposure to at least one antimicrobial agent within 90 days prior to HAP diagnosis. Pathogens were identified in 487 patients, with Acinetobacter baumannii [30.0% (183/610)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [22.0% (134/610)], Staphylococcus aureus [13.4% (82/610)] and Klebsiella pneumonia [9.7% (59/610)] being the most common pathogens. Eighteen patients (3.0%) had infection with fastidious bacteria. A. baumannii and S. aureus were the more frequent pathogens in the ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) cases [50.5% (97/192) and 21.4% (41/192)] as compared to non-VAP cases [20.6% (86/418) and 9.8% (41/418), P < 0.01]. A. baumannii and S. aureus were also frequent pathogens in cases with a score of more than 20 by the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHEII) scoring [45.7% (69/151) and 20.5% (31/151)], as compared to cases with a score of less than 20 of APACHE II [24.8% (114/459) and 11.1% (51/459), P < 0.01]. A. baumannii showed high resistance rates to carbapenems [more than 70% (109/142)], and the susceptibility to cefoperazone/sulbactam, polymyxin B and tigecycline were 40.8% (58/142), 99.3% (141/142) and 95.8% (136/142) respectively. Resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to meropenem and imipenem were 48.8% (40/82) and 70.7% (58/82) respectively. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 87.8% (43/49) in all strains of S. aureus. Mortality rate of VAP cases was 34.5% (61/177), significantly more than that of HAP patients [22.3% (135/605), P < 0.05]. The average hospital stay of patients with HAP was (23.8 +/- 20.5) days, significantly more than that of the average for inpatients [(13.2 +/- 13.6) days, P < 0.01] during the study period. Mean costs of HAP were (108 950 +/- 116 608) yuan, significantly higher than the average hospital costs of respiratory inpatients (17 999 +/- 33 364) yuan. CONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese patients hospitalized in urban tertiary medical centers, HAP incidence and mortality rate were high, which increased the patients' hospital stay and the medical costs. Common pathogens were A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and K. pneumonia. The common bacteria of HAP in China showed high resistance rates to antibiotics.
TI  - Three-year review of bacteriological profile and antibiogram of burn wound isolates in Van, Turkey.
AB  - The risk of infection in burns is well-known. In recent decades, the antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients has increased. For this reason, a retrospective study was conducted at Van Training and Research Hospital to analyze the bacterial isolates from the wounds of patients admitted to the Burn Unit and to determine the susceptibility patterns of the commonly cultured organisms over a 3-year period, January 2009 to December 2011.A total of 250 microorganisms were isolated from burn wounds of 179 patients. Our results revealed that the most frequent isolate was Acinetobacter baumannii (23.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.2%), Escherichia coli (10%) respectively. Multidrug-resistance has emerged as an important concern in our burn unit. Tigecycline, and colistin were found to be the most active drugs against Acinetobacter baumannii. Carbapenems and amikacin, were found to be the most active drugs against other gram negative bacteria. Vancomycin and linezolid were active against gram positive bacteria.Aggressive infection control measures should be applied to limit the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - bla(IMP) and bla(VIM) mediated carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species in India.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The emergence and rapid spread of blaIMP and blaVIM metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producing Gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial infections are of concern worldwide due to limited treatment options. METHODOLOGY: A total of 179 nonreplicate, consecutive, carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (61), Acinetobacter baumannii (116), Acinetobacter lwoffii (1) and Pseudomonas stutzeri (1) isolated from patients hospitalized for 48 hours or more were included in the study. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) to imipenem and meropenem were determined and interpreted according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. The Modified Hodge Test (MHT) and inhibitor potentiated disk diffusion tests with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were used for screening of carbapenamases and MBL production respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for the detection of MBL (blaVIM and blaIMP) genes. Gene sequencing was performed for representative isolates. RESULTS: MHT was positive in 94.4% (n = 169). MBL screening with EDTA was positive in 80.4% (n = 144). MBL genes bla VIM and bla IMP were detected in 92 (51.4%) isolates. Bla VIM alone was detected in 89 isolates while two isolates had bla IMP alone. One isolate had both bla VIM and bla IMP. Among the P. aeruginosa, 36 carried the MBL gene. In A. baumannii, 54 carried the MBL gene. Bla VIM was found in P. stutzeri and A. lwoffii isolates. CONCLUSION: Carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii is chiefly mediated by MBL production. The common MBL gene is the blaVIM.
TI  - Diagnosis of bacterial ventilator-associated pneumonia in children: reproducibility of blind bronchial sampling.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reproducibility of blind bronchial sampling in patients with suspected diagnosis of bacterial ventilator-associated pneumonia. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care, multidisciplinary, teaching hospital in Northern India. PATIENTS: All consecutive patients on mechanical ventilation for >48 hrs were evaluated clinically for ventilator-associated pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: Children with clinical ventilator-associated pneumonia were subjected to blind bronchial sampling twice. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-eight blind bronchial sampling samples from 34 patients were analyzed for polymorphonuclear cells, the presence, type, and number of bacteria. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common organism grown from distal respiratory secretions. For polymorphonuclear cells, the concordance between two blind bronchial samples was 85.3% and kappa coefficient was 0.65. The concordance for the presence and type of bacteria in Gram staining in two samples was 85.3% and kappa coefficient was 0.68. The intraclass coefficients for bacterial index and predominant species index were 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.65-0.91) and 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.78-0.94), respectively. The use of prior antibiotics did not adversely affect the reproducibility of blind bronchial sampling. No major complications were recorded during the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Blind bronchial sampling of lower respiratory tract secretions in mechanically ventilated patients generates reproducible results of quantitative and qualitative cultures. We suggest that blind bronchial sampling may provide valuable clue to the bacterial etiology in ventilated child with suspected clinical ventilator-associated pneumonia.
TI  - Additional risk factors for infection by multidrug-resistant pathogens in healthcare-associated infection: a large cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus regarding the definition of risk factors for healthcare-associated infection (HCAI). The purpose of this study was to identify additional risk factors for HCAI, which are not included in the current definition of HCAI, associated with infection by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, in all hospitalized infected patients from the community. METHODS: This 1-year prospective cohort study included all patients with infection admitted to a large, tertiary care, university hospital. Risk factors not included in the HCAI definition, and independently associated with MDR pathogen infection, namely MDR Gram-negative (MDR-GN) and ESKAPE microorganisms (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species, carbapenem-hydrolyzing Klebsiella pneumonia and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species), were identified by logistic regression among patients admitted from the community (either with community-acquired or HCAI). RESULTS: There were 1035 patients with infection, 718 from the community. Of these, 439 (61%) had microbiologic documentation; 123 were MDR (28%). Among MDR: 104 (85%) had MDR-GN and 41 (33%) had an ESKAPE infection. Independent risk factors associated with MDR and MDR-GN infection were: age (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.7 and 1.5, p = 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively), and hospitalization in the previous year (between 4 and 12 months previously) (adjusted OR = 2.0 and 1,7, p = 0.008 and p = 0.048, respectively). Infection by pathogens from the ESKAPE group was independently associated with previous antibiotic therapy (adjusted OR = 7.2, p < 0.001) and a Karnofsky index <70 (adjusted OR = 3.7, p = 0.003). Patients with infection by MDR, MDR-GN and pathogens from the ESKAPE group had significantly higher rates of inadequate antibiotic therapy than those without (46% vs 7%, 44% vs 10%, 61% vs 15%, respectively, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the inclusion of additional risk factors in the current definition of HCAI for MDR pathogen infection, namely age >60 years, Karnofsky index <70, hospitalization in the previous year, and previous antibiotic therapy, may be clinically beneficial for early diagnosis, which may decrease the rate of inadequate antibiotic therapy among these patients.
TI  - Growth inhibition of pathogenic bacteria by sulfonylurea herbicides.
AB  - Emerging resistance to current antibiotics raises the need for new microbial drug targets. We show that targeting branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis using sulfonylurea herbicides, which inhibit the BCAA biosynthetic enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), can exert bacteriostatic effects on several pathogenic bacteria, including Burkholderia pseudomallei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Our results suggest that targeting biosynthetic enzymes like AHAS, which are lacking in humans, could represent a promising antimicrobial drug strategy.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of triazole-containing N-acyl homoserine lactones as quorum sensing modulators.
AB  - Many bacterial species are capable of assessing their local population densities  through a cell-cell signaling mechanism termed quorum sensing (QS). This intercellular communication process is mediated by small molecule or peptide ligands and their cognate protein receptors. Numerous pathogens use QS to initiate virulence once they achieve a threshold cell number on a host. Consequently, approaches to intercept QS have attracted considerable attention as potential anti-infective therapies. Our interest in the development of small molecule tools to modulate QS pathways motivated us to evaluate triazole-containing analogs of natural N-acyl L-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals as non-native QS agonists and antagonists in Gram-negative bacteria. We synthesized 72 triazole derivatives of five broad structure types in high yields and purities using efficient Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne couplings. These compounds were evaluated for their ability to activate or inhibit two QS receptors from two prevalent pathogens - LasR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and AbaR from Acinetobacter baumannii- using bacterial reporter strains. Several triazole derivatives were identified that were capable of strongly modulating the activity of LasR and AbaR. These compounds represent a new and synthetically accessible class of AHL analogs, and could find utility as chemical tools to study QS and its role in bacterial virulence.
TI  - Pathogenic analysis of sputum from ventilator-associated pneumonia in a pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common and sometimes fatal complication in pediatric intensive care units (PICU). The aim of our study was to characterize the distribution and drug susceptibility of the pathogens isolated from the sputum of patients with VAP in the PICU of our hospital and to provide support to the administration of antibiotics early and reasonably in the clinic. Our study was conducted between January 2007 and December 2011 at the PICU of the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The endotracheal aspirates were collected and transported to a microbiology laboratory within 15 min. The pathogens were routinely analyzed and identified with Vitek 60 and Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion methods. Among the 121 VAP patients, 127 pathogenic strains were isolated from sputum specimens. Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 64.57% (82/127), 29.92% (38/127) and 5.51% (7/127), respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii (25.61%), Escherichia coli (20.27%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (20.27%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.22%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.46%) were frequently identified isolates among gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid. All fungi were sensitive to the antimicrobial agents. The gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent than gram-positive bacteria and fungi in VAP and demonstrated a higher drug resistance. It is important to administer antimicrobial agents early and reasonably for children with VAP. Knowledge of antibiotic resistance and the characteristics of drug resistance is important for VAP prophylaxis and treatment.
TI  - Effect of low-dose gaseous ozone on pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of chronically infected wounds is a challenge, and bacterial environmental contamination is a growing issue in infection control. Ozone may have a role in these situations. The objective of this study was to determine whether a low dose of gaseous ozone/oxygen mixture eliminates pathogenic bacteria cultivated in Petri dishes. METHODS: A pilot study with 6 bacterial strains was made using different concentrations of ozone in an ozone-oxygen mixture to determine a minimally effective dose that completely eliminated bacterial growth. The small and apparently bactericidal gaseous dose of 20 mug/mL ozone/oxygen (1:99) mixture, applied for 5 min under atmospheric pressure was selected. In the 2nd phase, eight bacterial strains with well characterized resistance patterns were evaluated in vitro using agar-blood in adapted Petri dishes (105 bacteria/dish). The cultures were divided into 3 groups: 1--ozone-oxygen gaseous mixture containing 20 mug of O(3)/mL for 5 min; 2--100% oxygen for 5 min; 3--baseline: no gas was used. RESULTS: The selected ozone dose was applied to the following eight strains: Escherichia coli, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to carbapenems, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. All isolates were completely inhibited by the ozone-oxygen mixture while growth occurred in the other 2 groups. CONCLUSION: A single topical application by nebulization of a low ozone dose completely inhibited the growth of all potentially pathogenic bacterial strains with known resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Photoinactivation of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria with the antimicrobial peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) conjugated to the hydrophilic photosensitizer eosin Y.
AB  - We test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) enhances the photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer eosin Y upon conjugation. The conjugate eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) was obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Photoinactivation assays were performed against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii AYE, as well as the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus , and Staphylococcus epidermidis . Partitioning assays were performed with E. coli and S. aureus . Photohemolysis and photokilling assays were also performed to assess the photodynamic activity of the conjugate toward mammalian cells. Eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) photoinactivates 99.999% of 10(8) CFU/mL of most bacteria tested at a concentration of 1 muM or below. In contrast, neither eosin Y nor (KLAKLAK)(2) cause any significant photoinactivation under similar conditions. The increase in photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer conferred by the antimicrobial peptide is in part due to the fact that (KLAKLAK)(2) promotes the association of eosin Y to bacteria. Eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) does not significantly associate with red blood cells or the cultured mammalian cell lines HaCaT, COS-7, and COLO 316. Consequently, little photodamage or photokilling is observed with these cells under conditions for which bacterial photoinactivation is achieved. The peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) therefore significantly enhances the photodynamic activity of eosin Y toward both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria while interacting minimally with human cells. Overall, our results suggest that antimicrobial peptides such as (KLAKLAK)(2) might serve as attractive agents that can target photosensitizers to bacteria specifically.
TI  - MexXY multidrug efflux system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Anti-pseudomonas aminoglycosides, such as amikacin and tobramycin, are used in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. However, their use is linked to the development of resistance. During the last decade, the MexXY multidrug efflux system has been comprehensively studied, and numerous reports of laboratory and clinical isolates have been published. This system has been increasingly recognized as one of the primary determinants of aminoglycoside resistance in P. aeruginosa. In P. aeruginosa cystic fibrosis isolates, upregulation of the pump is considered the most common mechanism of aminoglycoside resistance. Non-fermentative Gram-negative pathogens possessing very close MexXY orthologs such as Achromobacter xylosoxidans and various Burkholderia species (e.g., Burkholderia pseudomallei and B. cepacia complexes), but not B. gladioli, are intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides. Here, we summarize the properties (e.g., discovery, mechanism, gene expression, clinical significance) of the P. aeruginosa MexXY pump and other aminoglycoside efflux pumps such as AcrD of Escherichia coli, AmrAB-OprA of B. pseudomallei, and AdeABC of Acinetobacter baumannii. MexXY inducibility of the PA5471 gene product, which is dependent on ribosome inhibition or oxidative stress, is noteworthy. Moreover, the discovery of the cognate outer membrane component (OprA) of MexXY in the multidrug-resistant clinical isolate PA7, serotype O12 deserves special attention.
TI  - KPC-producer gram negative bacteria among burned infants in Motahari Hospital, Tehran: first report from Iran.
AB  - To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Klebsiella, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC) among burn infants in Iran. The objective of this study was to determine the phenotypic detection of these KPC among isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella spp. A cross-sectional study was performed (February to September 2011) at a tertiary burn hospital in Tehran, Iran. Sixty-four strains were isolated from 20 patients. Strain and genus of isolates were confirmed, antibiotic susceptibility testing was implemented, and KPC determined by Modified Hodge Test. Fifteen of 36 strains (six Pseudomonas aeruginosa, six Acinetobacter baumannii, and three Klebsiella pneumoniae) were resistant to imipenem. Ten strains of 36 Gram negative isolates were resistant to all tested antibiotics except for Colistin. Thirteen of 15 resistant imipenem strains were confirmed as KPC-producer bacteria that isolated from nine patients. Six of 36 isolated strains were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria, of which four strains were both KPC and ESBL. A high percentage of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains in our centre with positive KPC have created a major challenge in terms of mortality and morbidity. The findings of this study highlight the importance of implementing an effective infection control strategy to prevent and decrease the prevalence of KPC-producing organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of copper surfaces against carbapenemase-producing contemporary Gram-negative clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The antimicrobial activity of copper surfaces against a variety of contemporary carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria representative of the most problematic nosocomial pathogens worldwide was evaluated. METHODS: Twenty-four clinical isolates, comprising four of Escherichia coli, two of Enterobacter spp., eight of Klebsiella pneumoniae and five each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii producing either VIM-1 and/or KPC-2 or VIM-2 or OXA-type carbapenemases, were studied. The antimicrobial activity of 99% copper (Cu99%) and a 63% alloy (Cu63%) was evaluated in comparison with that of stainless steel (SS) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) by incubating approximately 10(6) cfu/cm(2) of the tested strains on each surface at room temperature. RESULTS: Copper demonstrated antimicrobial activity against all studied isolates. This effect was observed earlier and was more pronounced for Cu99% than for Cu63%. Cu99% showed a bactericidal effect after <2 h for A. baumannii, 3 h for Enterobacter spp., 5 h for K. pneumoniae and 6 h for P. aeruginosa and E. coli. No viable colonies were recovered from five (20.8%) isolates after 3 h and from nine (37.5%) isolates after 5 h of incubation on Cu99%. CONCLUSIONS: Copper has significant antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant nosocomial Gram-negative pathogens. This supports the hypothesis that replacement of high-contact materials with copper could reduce the high burden of environmental contamination around high-risk patients. However, this strategy should be seen as an adjunctive measure to established cleaning protocols and to good hygiene practices for prevention of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Four Year Trend of Carbapenem-Resistance in Newly Opened ICUs of a University-Affiliated Hospital of South Korea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistance is rapidly evolving among the pathogenic microbes in intensive care units (ICUs). This study aimed to determine annual trend of carbapenem-resistance in the ICU for 4 years, since the opening of a university-affiliated hospital in South Korea. METHODS: From 2005 to 2008, microbial samples from consecutive 6,772 patients were screened in the ICU. Three hundred and ninety-seven patients (5.9%) and their first isolates of carbapenem-resistant pathogens were analyzed. RESULTS: The percentage of patients infected with carbapenem-resistant organisms increased constantly during the initial three years (2.3% in 2005, 6.2% in 2006, 7.8% in 2007), then it declined to 6.5% in 2008. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score at admission was 58.0+/-23.5, the median length of the ICU stay was 37 days, and the mortality rate was 37.5%. The sampling sites were endotracheal suction (67%), catheterized urine (17%), wound (6%) and others (10%). Bacteria with carbapenem-resistance were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (247 isolates, 62%), Acinetobacter baumannii (117 isolates, 30%), Enterobacteriaceae (12 isolates, 3%), and others (21, 5%). Of note, peak isolation of carbapenem-resistant microorganisms in medical ICU was followed by the same epidemic at surgical ICU. CONCLUSION: Taken together, carbapenem-resistant pathogens are of growing concern in the ICU.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  - Immunocompromised hosts are at high risk for bloodstream infections (BSIs); the outcome is unpredictable (even with adequate therapy), frequently severe (mortality 27%). A 26 months survey in a haematology/oncology hospital was set-up; it comprised 158 patients and detected 171 positive blood cultures. The origin of the infections was primitive in 27.22% and secondary in 72.78% of the cases; the most frequent cause was the presence of a vascular catheter (23.41%). The second most important cause were the respiratory infections (19.62%), followed by the urinary tract infections (UTIs) (11.39%). Gram negative bacilli represented 59.4%, the enterobacteriaceae were predominant (35.59%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.73%) and species like Serratia marcescens and Acinetobacter baumannii. Although isolated at low level, they worry by an increasing frequency. Among Gram positive cocci (43.51%) coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) were the most frequent (25.42%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18.08%); Enterococcus faecalis (5.65%) was isolated from polymicrobial (associated) infections. The strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were constantly susceptible to carbapenems, demonstrating otherwise various susceptibility patterns, generally elevated to the antibiotics we tested. The production of extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL) was 22.58%. The methicillin resistance was 54.4% in S. aureus strains; the susceptibility was variable among 7 other antibiotics tested. One Staphylococcus strain had reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. A multidisciplinary survey is necessary for the control of the multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO).
TI  - Intraventricular antimicrobial therapy in postneurosurgical Gram-negative bacillary meningitis or ventriculitis: a hospital-based retrospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postneurosurgical Gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM) or ventriculitis is a serious issue. Intraventricular (IVT) therapy has been applied; however, its effectiveness remains controversial, and the adverse drug effects are considerable. METHODS: The demographic data, treatment strategies, and clinical outcomes of patients with postneurosurgical GNBM or ventriculitis were recorded. RESULTS: From 2003 to 2011, data on 127 episodes of infection in 109 patients were collected, and 15 episodes in 14 patients were treated using a sequential combination of intravenous antibiotics and IVT therapy; others received intravenous antibiotics alone. The average age of patients who received a sequential combination with IVT therapy was 48.9 years, and 71.4% of the patients were men. The regimens used for IVT therapies included gentamicin (n = 4), amikacin (n = 7), and colistin (n = 4). After meningitis had been diagnosed, the average period that elapsed before initiation of IVT therapy was 25.4 days, and the average duration of IVT therapy was 13.3 days. The most frequently isolated pathogen from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was Acinetobacter baumannii, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. The cure rate was 73.3%. Of note, the mean period to sterilize the CSF after appropriate IVT antibiotic treatment was 6.6 days. There were no incidents of seizure or chemical ventriculitis during this IVT therapy. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that IVT antibiotic therapy is a useful option in the treatment of postneurosurgical GNBM or ventriculitis, especially for those with a treatment-refractory state.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acid exhibit potent bactericidal activity against ESKAPE pathogens.
AB  - A series of 36 synthetic antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acids  were screened to determine their effectiveness to treat Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pnemoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens, which are known to commonly infect chronic wounds. The primary amino acid sequences of these peptides incorporate either three or six dipeptide units consisting of the unnatural amino acids Tetrahydroisoquinolinecarboxylic acid (Tic) and Octahydroindolecarboxylic acid (Oic). The Tic-Oic dipeptide units are separated by SPACER amino acids with specific physicochemical properties that control how these peptides interact with bacterial cell membranes of different chemical compositions. These peptides exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against these pathogens in the range from >100 to 6.25 mug/mL. The observed diversity of MIC values for these peptides against the various bacterial strains are consistent with our hypothesis that the complementarity of the physicochemical properties of the peptide and the lipid of the bacteria's cell membrane determines the resulting antibacterial activity of the peptide.
TI  - Use of nebulized antimicrobial agents in burned and mechanically ventilated patients with persistent Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Enterobacteriacea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nebulized antibiotics are used to locally treat colonizations of multi-resistant organisms. Prior systemic nephrotoxic antibiotic use with serum creatinine rises warranted an alternative therapy in 69 ventilator-dependent patients with persisting sputum cultures and need for ventilatory support. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following IRB approval, retrospective patient data were reviewed. Analysis included comparison of these 69 patients (71 treatments) to 142 Gram-negative infected burn patients matched for age and burn size. RESULTS: Mean pooled age and burn wound percent for the 71 triplicates (n=211 patients) were 55.6+/-18.3 years and 27.4+/-22.3% burns. Fifty-seven of 69 (83%) patients had inhalation injuries and 54 of 69 (78%) patients survived. Nebulizations averaged 6.8+/-3.3 days (range 3-12 days). Serum creatinine rose in 2 patients receiving colistimethate nebulizations, known to cause nephrotoxicity following nebulization. Triplicate comparisons via ANOVA noted prolonged ventilatory support (F=13.39; p<<0.05) and length of stay (F=6.11; p<<0.5). Variance was attributed to the sicker nebulized patients. Twenty-four inhalation injury-only triplicates further confirmed that nebulized patient subgroup was more ill. CONCLUSION: Short duration antibiotic nebulization may allow higher intra-tracheal antibiotic concentrations and may facilitate weaning from the ventilator by reducing bacterial bioburden.
TI  - Comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: India.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of Salmonella typhi and Candida albicans. Reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. A very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. Daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. RESULTS: The highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by DesNet (5.05) and Bacillocid special (5.02). A comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for Lysol, Bacillocid sp. and DesNet, respectively. In the discard jars, Bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, DesNet for 3 days and Hi-giene Germitol for 1 day. The remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on Day 1. Phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like DesNet and Bacillocid special. CONCLUSIONS: Newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.
TI  - Role of the moth fly Clogmia albipunctata (Diptera: Psychodinae) as a mechanical  vector of bacterial pathogens in German hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The formerly Mediterranean moth fly species Clogmia albipunctata (Diptera: Psychodidae) is now present in Germany, where it has become a common, year-round pest in hospital buildings. AIM: To investigate the potential of C. albipunctata to transport and transmit bacterial pathogens in infested German hospitals. METHODS: From June 2011 to May 2012, 271 adult C. albipunctata were collected from four infested hospitals and analysed qualitatively and, in part, quantitatively, for bacterial colonization. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for selected nosocomial pathogens. FINDINGS: Forty-five bacterial species representing 40 genera were found to be colonizing C. albipunctata. Among the bacteria isolated were Acinetobacter baumannii, Aeromonas hydrophila, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, with colonization rates of 0-17.5%, 0-16.7%, 0-12.5%, 0-62.1%, 0-2.5%, 0-4.1%, 0-12.5%, 0-7.6% and 0-10%, respectively. Additionally, one strain of both Yersinia frederiksenii and Nocardia spp. was detected. Unlike 11 strains of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) S. maltophilia collected from one hospital, no MDR Enterobacteriaceae were isolated. Acinetobacter spp. colonized C. albipunctata at rates from 2.9% to 36.8%, and revealed a high affinity for the exoskeleton, with up to 2080 colony-forming units per moth fly for A. baumannii. CONCLUSION: C. albipunctata is a potential mechanical vector of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  - Postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (LVFX) has been conducted continuously since 1992. The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs.
TI  - [Clinical analysis of early postoperative pulmonary infection in children after living donor liver transplantation].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the condition of early (</= 30 d) postoperative pulmonary infection in children after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). METHOD: The clinical data of 36 cases undergoing LDLT in Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were analyzed retrospectively from June 2006 to December 2009. RESULT: Of 36 cases without preoperative respiratory disease, 17 were boys, 19 were girls. Their age ranged from 2 months to 14 years. Pulmonary infection developed in 24 patients, of whom 4 cases died (17%) and 3 deaths were related to pulmonary infection. Pulmonary infection occurred in 17 of 20 infants (85%) and 10 of 11 cases (91%) with liver function of Child-Pugh grade C. Twenty cases (83%) developed pulmonary infection within first 2 weeks after LDLT. Totally 65 pathogenic strains of microorganisms were isolated, in which Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and fungi were 46 strains, 5 strains, 14 strains respectively. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8 strains) and Acinetobacter baumannii (8 strains). Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed a resistance rate of almost 100% to cotrimoxazole, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, the first, the second and some of the third generation cephalosporins. Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase had a resistance rate of almost 100% to beta-lactams except carbapenems. Acinetobacter baumannii was exquisitely susceptible to carbapenems, but showed a high resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins. Candida albicans, which was the most common fungus, showed a susceptibility rate of 100% to amphotericin B. In the LDLT recipients of pulmonary infection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections occurred in 2 patients and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection in 1 patient. CONCLUSION: The incidence of early postoperative pulmonary infection was high in children undergoing LDLT, especially in infants. And the mortality should not be ignored. The high risk period for infection was within the first 2 weeks after operation. The pathogens were mainly Gram-negative bacteria, which showed high and multidrug resistance.
TI  - Carbapenem-associated multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii are sensitised  by aztreonam in combination with polyamines.
AB  - Carbapenem-associated multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-Ab) are common among clinical isolates worldwide and are a major therapeutic challenge. Previously it was shown that exogenous polyamines (spermine and spermidine) enhanced susceptibility to beta-lactams but induced resistance to polymyxins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study aimed to explore the possible availability of exogenous polyamines in treating carbapenem-associated MDR-Ab. The effects of polyamines on the growth rate of A. baumannii, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibiotics, and time-kill and chequerboard assays were determined. Roles of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and beta-lactamase activity of A. baumannii were also assessed for the polyamine effects. Growth of A. baumannii was unaffected at 4mM spermine and 16 mM spermidine alone, but was significantly inhibited by a subinhibitory concentration of aztreonam (AZT) (8 mug/mL) and those concentrations of the polyamines. MICs to AZT alone (>/=128 mug/mL) were reduced to the range 0.25-8 mug/mL in combination with polyamines in all carbapenem-associated MDR-Ab. MICs to penicillins, but not to ceftazidime and meropenem, were also significantly reduced, whilst MICs to other antibiotics, including polymyxin B, were unaffected in combination with polyamines for all tested A. baumannii. Polyamine effects on AZT were strongly synergistic with bactericidal activity and were retained at concentrations of 5mM MgCl(2) (or CaCl(2)) or 200 mM NaCl. Roles of LPS and beta-lactamase in the polyamine effects were excluded. Overall results suggest that AZT in combination with polyamines may be useful for the treatment of carbapenem-associated MDR-Ab.
TI  - Biocidal activity of metalloacid-coated surfaces against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial effects of a coating of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)  has been recently described. The metalloacid material produces oxonium ions (H3O+), which creates an acidic pH that is an effective, non specific antimicrobial. We determined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of molybdenum trioxide metalloacid-coated surfaces. METHODS: Metalloacid-coated and non-coated (control) surfaces were contaminated by exposing them for 15 minutes to microbial suspensions containing 105 cfu/mL. Eleven microorganisms responsible for nosocomial infections were tested: two Staphylococcus aureus strains (the hetero-vancomycin intermediate MRSA Mu50 strain and a ST80-PVL-producing MRSA strain); a vancomycin-resistant vanA Enterococcus faecium strain; three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains; a MBL-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain; a multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain; a toxin-producing Clostridium difficile strain; and two fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus). The assay tested the ability of the coated surfaces to kill microorganisms. RESULTS: Against all non-sporulating microorganisms tested, metalloacid-coated surfaces exhibited significant antimicrobial activity relative to that of the control surfaces within two to six hours after contact with the microorganisms (p < 0.001). Microorganism survival on the coated surfaces was greatly impaired, whereas microorganism survival on control surfaces remained substantial. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that, facing the continuing shedding of microorganisms in the vicinity of colonized or infected patients, the continuous biocidal effect of hydroxonium oxides against multidrug-resistant microorganisms may help limit environmental contamination between consecutive cleaning procedures.
TI  - Detection of bacterial 16S rRNA and identification of four clinically important bacteria by real-time PCR.
AB  - Within the paradigm of clinical infectious disease research, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa represent the four most clinically relevant, and hence most extensively studied bacteria. Current culture-based methods for identifying these organisms are slow and cumbersome, and there is increasing need for more rapid and accurate molecular detection methods. Using bioinformatic tools, 962,279 bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned, and regions of homology were selected to generate a set of real-time PCR primers that target 93.6% of all bacterial 16S rRNA sequences published to date. A set of four species-specific real-time PCR primer pairs were also designed, capable of detecting less than 100 genome copies of A. baumannii, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. All primers were tested for specificity in vitro against 50 species of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Additionally, the species-specific primers were tested against a panel of 200 clinical isolates of each species, randomly selected from a large repository of clinical isolates from diverse areas and sources. A comparison of culture and real-time PCR demonstrated 100% concordance. The primers were incorporated into a rapid assay capable of positive identification from plate or broth cultures in less than 90 minutes. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that current targets, such as the uidA gene in E.coli, are not suitable as species-specific genes due to sequence variation. The assay described herein is rapid, cost-effective and accurate, and can be easily incorporated into any research laboratory capable of real-time PCR.
TI  - Burn unit: colonization of burn wounds and local environment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We present the results of a comparative prospective study of the resistance profile of strains isolated from pathological material of patients hospitalized in the burn unit of the military hospital in Rabat and from their environment over a period of one and a half years (July 2009-February 2011). METHODS: The study concerned 125 pathological products from patients (40 men, 20 women; mean age 38+/-14.8 years; range 2 to 80 years) hospitalized with burns. This allowed the isolation of 86 non-redundant bacterial strains during the first period and 50 during the second. RESULTS: The dominant species were Acinetobacter baumannii (15.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (11%). During the second period, we noted the abundance of A. baumannii (15.5%), followed by P. aeruginosa (11.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.5%). Of the 104 environmental samples of burn patients, 139 microorganisms were isolated. Coagulase-negative staphylococcus was the most abundant strain in the two study periods (69.2% and 64.6%). CONCLUSION: All species showed an almost identical sensitivity to the various antibiotics tested.
TI  - Verification of monoplex and multiplex linear-after-the-exponential PCR gene-specific sepsis assays using clinical isolates.
AB  - AIMS: To verify monoplex and multiplex gene-specific linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (LATE-PCR) assays for identifying 17 microbial pathogens (i.e., Klebsiella sp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase negative staphylococci, Enterococcus sp., Candida sp.) commonly associated with septicaemia using clinical isolates. METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical isolates of each target pathogen were collected from the University of California, Davis Medical Center (UCDMC) microbiology laboratory. Five microlitres (mul) of each culture suspension (1 x 10(8) CFU ml(-1) ) were added to 20 mul of monoplex mastermix. DNA extracted from clinical isolates was tested in multiplex. Monoplex assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity at this input level, except Enterobacter cloacae (2.7%), Ac. baumannii (57%) and Ps. aeruginosa (97.8%). All clinical isolates were positive in multiplex, with the exception of two Ac. baumannii, two Klebsiella oxytoca and two Candida parapsilosis isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Sixteen pathogens can be identified by monoplex LATE-PCR assays with sensitivities >/= 97.8%. The multiplex assay demonstrated 91.4% sensitivity when tested with DNA extracted from 70 different target strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates the potential of LATE-PCR to serve as an adjunct to culture if the reagents are optimized for sensitivity. Results warrant further testing through analytical and clinical validation of the multiplex assay.
TI  - Design of a single-tube, endpoint, linear-after-the-exponential-PCR assay for 17  pathogens associated with sepsis.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to construct a single-tube multiplex molecular diagnostic assay using linear-after-the-exponential (LATE)-PCR for the detection of 17 microbial pathogens commonly associated with septicaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: The assay described here detects 17 pathogens associated with sepsis via amplification and analysis of gene-specific sequences. The pathogens and their targeted genes were: Klebsiella spp. (phoE); Acinetobacter baumannii (gyrB); Staphylococcus aureus (spa); Enterobacter spp. (thdF); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (toxA); coagulase-negative staphylococci (tuf), Enterococcus spp. (tuf); Candida spp. (P450). A sequence from an unidentified gene in Lactococcus lactis, served as a positive control for assay function. LATE-PCR was used to generate single-stranded amplicons that were analysed at endpoint over a wide range of temperatures in four fluorescent colours. Each target was detected by its pattern of hybridization to a sequence-specific low-temperature fluorescent probe derived from molecular beacons. CONCLUSIONS: All 17 microbial targets were detected in samples containing low numbers of pathogen genomes in the presence of high levels of human genomic DNA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This assay used new technology to achieve an advance in the field of molecular diagnostics: a single-tube assay for detection of pathogens commonly responsible for septicaemia.
TI  - Management and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens  is a leading healthcare-associated infection in mechanically ventilated patients. The incidence of VAP due to MDR pathogens has increased significantly in the last decade. Risk factors for VAP due to MDR organisms include advanced age, immunosuppression, broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, increased severity of illness, previous hospitalization or residence in a chronic care facility and prolonged duration of invasive mechanical ventilation. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and several different species of Gram-negative bacteria can cause MDR VAP. Especially difficult Gram-negative bacteria include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteraciae and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing bacteria. Proper management includes selecting appropriate antibiotics, optimizing dosing and using timely de-escalation based on antiimicrobial sensitivity data. Evidence-based strategies to prevent VAP that incorporate multidisciplinary staff education and collaboration are essential to reduce the burden of this disease and associated healthcare costs.

TI  - Efficacy of high-dose nebulized colistin in ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colistin often remains the only active agent against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The aim of the study was to assess efficacy of nebulized colistin for treating ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-five patients with VAP caused by P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were enrolled in a prospective, observational, and comparative study. The sensitive strain group included 122 patients with VAP caused by P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii susceptible to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, or quinolones and treated with intravenous antibiotics for 14 days. The multidrug-resistant strain group included 43 patients with VAP caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii and treated with nebulized colistin (5 million international units every 8 h) either in monotherapy (n=28) or combined to a 3-day intravenous aminoglycosides for 7-19 days. The primary endpoint was clinical cure rate. Aerosol was delivered using vibrating plate nebulizer. RESULTS: After treatment, clinical cure rate was 66% in sensitive strain group and 67% in multidrug-resistant strain group (difference -1%, lower limit of 95% CI for difference -12.6%). Mortality was not different between groups (23 vs. 16%). Among 16 patients with persisting or recurrent P. aeruginosa infection, colistin minimum inhibitory concentration increased in two patients. CONCLUSION: Nebulization of high-dose colistin was effective to treat VAP caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii. Its therapeutic effect was noninferior to intravenous beta-lactams associated with aminoglycosides or quinolones for treating VAP caused by susceptible P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.
TI  - [Analysis on the clinical pulmonary infection score on the detection of multidrug resistance organisms in lower respiratory tract in ventilated patients in intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of multidrug resistance (MDR) organisms from the lower respiratory tract in ventilated patients, and the constitution, detection time and mortality of the intensive care unit (ICU) patients with different clinical pulmonary infection scores (CPIS). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. The clinical data of 72 cases with lower respiratory tract MDR on ventilation more than 48 hours were collected from April 2010 to December 2011. CPIS were calculated at the same time. Thirty-three patients with CPIS>6 were diagnosed as ventilation associated pneumonia (VAP), while 39 having CPIS </=6 (non-VAP). The characteristics of MDR, the detection time and mortality of the patients were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The first five MDR were Baumannii [49.5%(34/74)], Klebsiella pneumoniae [24.3%(18/74)], Escherichia coli [20.3%(15/74)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [5.4%(4/74)] and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA, 4.1%(3/74)] in VAP group, while the first five were Escherichia coli [40.2%(37/92)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [33.7%(31/92)], Klebsiella pneumoniae [13.1%(12/92)], Baumannii [8.7%(8/92)] and MRSA [4.3%(4/92)] in non-VAP group. There was no significant difference in average detection time between VAP group and non-VAP group (10.7+/-1.5 days vs. 9.4+/-1.8 days, P>0.05). The mortality rate in VAP group was significantly higher than that in non-VAP group (39.4% vs. 23.1%, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different MDR may be detected in lower respiratory tracts no matter the ventilated patients having VAP or not, which influence the patients prognosis and should be monitored intensively. Antibiotics should be empirically prescribed and adjusted dynamically.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic profiling of doripenem, imipenem and meropenem against prevalent  Gram-negative organisms in the Asia-Pacific region.
AB  - Carbapenems are increasingly being utilised owing to the escalating prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacteria from community and hospital settings. In this study, pharmacodynamic profiles of doripenem, imipenem and meropenem were evaluated against Gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalised patients. MICs for carbapenems were determined for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii obtained from the COMPACT II programme conducted in the Asia-Pacific region. Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken to assess the pharmacodynamic profile of carbapenems against each of the pathogens. All carbapenem regimens achieved optimal exposures [cumulative fraction of response (CFR) >/=90%] against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Against P. aeruginosa, doripenem achieved 81.3-95.3% CFR, imipenem achieved 55.2-77.9% CFR and meropenem achieved 71.9-91.3% CFR; only doripenem regimens of 4-h infusion of 1000 mg every 8h (q8h) and 1-h and 4-h infusion of 2000 mg q8h and a meropenem regimen of 3-h infusion of 2000 mg q8h obtained optimal exposures; all carbapenem regimens showed slight (1-7%) improvement in CFRs in favour of isolates collected from ICU sources. Against A. baumannii, CFRs were much lower (25.9-46.7% CFR) and no carbapenem regimens achieved optimal exposure in or outside the ICU. Owing to the high potency of carbapenems against these Enterobacteriaceae populations, standard regimens are likely to perform well in the Asia-Pacific region. However, larger doses combined with prolonged infusions will be required to increase the CFR for these carbapenems against resistant non-fermenting Gram-negatives such as P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii that are prevalent in these countries.
TI  - Comparison of polymyxin B with other antimicrobials in the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia and tracheobronchitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to compare the efficacy of polymyxin B with other antimicrobials in the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and tracheobronchitis (VAT) by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed. Patients >18 years of age with the diagnosis of VAP or VAT who received appropriate therapy for >48 h were analyzed. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Clinical covariates were assessed and compared between the groups. RESULTS: A total of 67 episodes were analyzed: 45 (67 %) treated with polymyxin B and 22 (33 %) with comparators. The crude 30-day mortality was 53 % (24 of 45) in the polymyxin B group and 27 % (6 of 22) in the comparator group (P = 0.08). Multivariable analysis using Cox regression models indicated that polymyxin B treatment was independently associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Polymyxin B treatment in the currently recommended dosage may be inferior to other drugs in the treatment of VAP and VAT caused by organisms tested as susceptible in vitro to this agent.
TI  - Impact of susceptibility profiles of Gram-negative bacteria before and after the  introduction of ertapenem at a medical center in northern Taiwan from 2004 to 2010.
AB  - This retrospective observational study evaluated the impact of antimicrobial consumption on antimicrobial susceptibility among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria after introducing ertapenem to the formulary of a teaching hospital (1130 beds) in northern Taiwan. Data on consumption of various antimicrobial agents, expressed as defined daily dose/1000 patient-days (DDD/1000 PD), were collected retrospectively from hospital pharmacy records 2 years before and 5 years after the introduction of ertapenem (October 2005). During the study period, the consumption of ampicillin and aminoglycosides decreased significantly. In contrast, the consumption of cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) increased significantly over time. There was a significant increase in the rate of susceptibility of Escherichia coli to ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefpirome, amikacin, and levofloxacin; an increase in the rate of susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, levofloxacin, and amikacin; a significant decrease in the rate of susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to meropenem; and a significant decrease in the rate of susceptibility of Acinetobacter baumannii to ceftazidime, carbapenems, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. The rate of antibiotic susceptibility to ertapenem of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers, including E. coli and K. pneumoniae, remained stable. Usage of ertapenem was found to be negatively and significantly associated with the susceptibility rates of P. aeruginosa to meropenem and gentamicin. Significantly negative correlations were noted between the use of ertapenem and the rates of susceptibility of A. baumannii to ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem), ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin.
TI  - [Carbapenemases in gram-negative bacteria. Current data and trends of resistance  resulting from the work of national reference centres].
AB  - The spread of carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria is one of the major  challenges of the present. Since 2009, the National Reference Laboratory for gram-negative nosocomial pathogens has observed the molecular epidemiology of carbapenemases in Germany. In 2011, 1,454 referred bacterial isolates were tested for the presence of carbapenemases. Carbapenemase was found in 34.4% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates, in 19.9% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and in 96.3% of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. The most frequent carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae were OXA-48, KPC and VIM-1; in P. aeruginosa it was VIM-2 and in A. baumannii OXA-23.
TI  - Activities of doripenem against nosocomial bacteremic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in a medical center in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of nosocomial infections in Taiwan hospitals are caused  by drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and various species of Enterobacteriaceae. Carbapenems are important agents for treating infections caused by these GNB. Recently, doripenem was approved for use in Taiwan in August 2009. However, data on its in vitro activity against nosocomial GNB isolated from Taiwan remain limited. The study was designed to look into this clinical issue. METHODS: A total of 400 nonduplicated nosocomial blood isolates isolated in 2009, inclusive of P. aeruginosa (n = 100), A. baumannii (n = 100), and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 200), were randomly selected from the bacterial bank preserved at National Taiwan University Hospital. Susceptibilities of these 400 isolates to various antibiotics, including doripenem, imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, colistin, and tigecycline were determined by using Etest. RESULTS: Doripenem demonstrated similar in vitro activity to imipenem and meropenem against P. aeruginosa (87%, vs. 85% and 89%), A. baumannii (56%, vs. 60% and 60%), and Enterobacteriaceae (100%, vs. 98.5% and 99.5%). The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant (any one of three tested carbapenems) P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and Enterobacteriaceae isolates was 15%, 44%, and 0.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Doripenem was as effective as imipenem and meropenem in our study. However, there was a significant proportion of carbapenem resistance among the tested isolates. Hence, longitudinal surveillance is necessary to monitor the resistance trend.
TI  - Detection of SPM-1-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and class D beta-lactamase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii isolates by use of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - This study evaluates the accuracy of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) for detecting carbapenem hydrolytic activity among SPM-1-, GIM-1-, and GES-5-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and OXA-143-, IMP-10-, and OXA-58-producing Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Class A and B carbapenemase activities were rapidly detected by MALDI-TOF in a 2-h assay. However, an extended incubation time was necessary for detection of carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D beta-lactamase (CHDL) activity in Acinetobacter spp.
TI  - [Cancer, febrile neutropenia and pulmonary images: Findings in bronchoalveolar lavage in children].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lung infections are a serious complication in children with cancer. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been demonstrated to be an effective procedure for achieving etiologic diagnosis. METHOD: We did a retrospective analysis of BAL data performed between November 2005 and October 2008 in children with cancer, severe neutropenia and lung infiltrates for assessing its performance, clinical utility and safety. Thirty-seven BAL were evaluated in 35 patients. RESULTS: Focal infiltrates were demonstrated in imaging studies associated with 19/37 BAL; in 8 an infectious agent was found. Interstitial pattern was observed in 15/37, in which there were 4 positive studies, proving a higher microbiological performance in BAL associated with focal lesions. BAL yielded significant microbiological findings in 32.4% (12/37). Sixteen microorganisms were identified in the study: bacteria in 8 cases, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n: 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n: 2), Acinetobacter baumannii (n: 1), A. Iwoffii (n: 1), group viridans Streptococcus (n: 1), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n: 1); viruses in 3 cases, metapneumovirus (n: 2) cytomegalovirus (n: 1) and fungal infection in 5 cases, Pneumocystis jiroveci (n: 2) Aspergillus fumigatus (n: 1), Aspergillus niger (n: 1), Candida albicans (n: 1). Therapeutic adjustments were done in 6/37 episodes (16.2%). CONCLUSION: BAL has a significant role in the evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in pediatric oncological patients, requiring a prompt and safe diagnosis, which is crucial for the survival with minimal morbidity. Our results suggest that BAL by fiberbronchoscopy should be considered as an initial diagnostic tool in these patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in internal medicine wards.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a global medical problem, affecting most bacterial pathogens. The major challenges are currently posed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenemases, and multi-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Therapeutic options are very limited and, in some cases, virtually unavailable. This article provides an overview of the recent epidemiological trends exhibited by the most important multi-resistant pathogens, and of the treatment options that are currently available for these infections.
TI  - Efflux: how bacteria use pumps to control their microenvironment.
AB  - Efflux pumps are a potent and clinically important cause of antibiotic resistance. The particular focus of this chapter is on the efflux pump as a target for antimicrobial therapy and the development of new antibacterials to address the efflux problem.Tigecycline is an example of how old antibiotics, in this case tetracyclines, which have become substrates for efflux pumps, can be extensively modified to restore antimicrobial activity and clinical efficacy.
TI  - Human serum albumin stabilized gold nanoclusters as selective luminescent probes  for Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In this work, human serum albumin (HSA) stabilized gold nanoclusters (HSA-AuNCs)  with reddish photoluminescence were used as sensing probes for pathogenic bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli J96, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (PDRAB), Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). We discovered that HSA-AuNCs have unique affinity with S. aureus and MRSA. In addition to demonstrating the selective sensing ability of HSA-AuNCs toward S. aureus and MRSA, the binding peptide motifs identified from HSA-AuNCs were characterized by mass spectrometry. The identified binding peptides were further used as the reducing and stabilizing agents for generation of peptide-bound AuNCs (Pep-AuNCs). The generated Pep-AuNCs were demonstrated to have the binding affinities with S. aureus and MRSA.
TI  - Class 1 integrons in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolated  from clinical isolates.
AB  - Resistance to various antimicrobial agents is an increasing problem in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii infections. In this study, the roles of integrons were examined in 101 P. aeruginosa isolates and 176 A. baumannii isolates from patients. The frequencies and characteristics of class 1, 2 and 3 integrons were investigated and the horizontal transfer of integrons was assessed. Among these isolates, class 1 integrons with a resistance gene cassette were detected in 69.3% of P. aeruginosa and 31.8% of A. baumannii isolates, but class 2 and 3 integrons were not found. Five novel gene cassette arrays were identified in P. aeruginosa: aacA7-cmlA, aadB-blaOXA,-o-aadA1, aadB-arr-2-cmlA-blaOXA,-o-aadA1, aadB-cmlA-aadA1 and aadB-cmlA-blaOXA-10-aadA15. The integrons found in A. baumannii isolates in this study were previously reported. Horizontal transfer of some class 1 integrons was detected in both P. aeruginosa (2/70) and A. baumannii (5/57). These data confirm the high prevalence of class 1 integrons with a variety of gene cassette combinations among multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii clinical isolates.
TI  - [Etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia at the Cardiovascular Surgery Clinic of Iasi].
AB  - AIM: We want to assess the etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and  emergence of resistant phenotypes for greater efficiency of the first-line antimicrobial treatment post-cardiac surgery. The study focuses on patients with VAP post-cardiac surgery at the Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery between April 2nd 2002 and August 27th 2008, divided in two groups, before and after June 14th, 2005. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The tracheal aspirates were examined quantitatively (microscopy, culture). The isolates with clinical significance (> or = 106 CFU/mL) were identified by standard methods and tested by disk difussion or with the breakpoints method for susceptibility to antibiotics. RESULTS: Among the 1527 operated patients, 28 of them were diagnosed with VAP through the clinical pulmonary infection score > or = 6. The 9 most common pathogens in VAP etiology were Pseudomonas aeruginosa 23.81%, Acinetobacter baumannii 19.05%, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 11.91%, Candida albicans 9.53%, while Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium striatum/amycolatum, Pneumocystis jirovecii amounted 4.76% each. Acinetobacter baumannii and S.maltophilia appear starting with June 15th, 2005. From that moment on we isolated with a higher frequency the gram-negative bacilli which produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases 15.62%, with multidrug resistance (MDR) 46.86%. The MDR phenotype was more frequent at A.baumannii (15.62%), S. maltophilia (15.62%) and P. aeruginosa (12.50%) compared to K .pneumoniae (3.12%) or E. coli (0%). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was isolated with a 6.25% frequency. CONCLUSIONS: The most common etiologic agents of ventilator-associated pneumonia post-cardiac surgery are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Candida albicans. The large use of antibiotics selects infectious agents with intrinsic resistance and multiresistant
TI  - Rapid detection and statistical differentiation of KPC gene variants in Gram-negative pathogens by use of high-resolution melting and ScreenClust analyses.
AB  - In the United States, the production of the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is an important mechanism of carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative pathogens. Infections with KPC-producing organisms are associated with increased morbidity and mortality; therefore, the rapid detection of KPC-producing pathogens is critical in patient care and infection control. We developed a real-time PCR assay complemented with traditional high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, as well as statistically based genotyping, using the Rotor-Gene ScreenClust HRM software to both detect the presence of bla(KPC) and differentiate between KPC-2-like and KPC-3-like alleles. A total of 166 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii with various beta-lactamase susceptibility patterns were tested in the validation of this assay; 66 of these organisms were known to produce the KPC beta-lactamase. The real-time PCR assay was able to detect the presence of bla(KPC) in all 66 of these clinical isolates (100% sensitivity and specificity). HRM analysis demonstrated that 26 had KPC-2-like melting peak temperatures, while 40 had KPC-3-like melting peak temperatures. Sequencing of 21 amplified products confirmed the melting peak results, with 9 isolates carrying bla(KPC-2) and 12 isolates carrying bla(KPC-3). This PCR/HRM assay can identify KPC-producing Gram-negative pathogens in as little as 3 h after isolation of pure colonies and does not require post-PCR sample manipulation for HRM analysis, and ScreenClust analysis easily distinguishes bla(KPC-2-like) and bla(KPC-3-like) alleles. Therefore, this assay is a rapid method to identify the presence of bla(KPC) enzymes in Gram-negative pathogens that can be easily integrated into busy clinical microbiology laboratories.
TI  - Novel antimicrobial agents against multi-drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria: an overview.
AB  - No novel antimicrobial agents against multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria have been available to daily clinical practice during the last 5 years. On the other hand, resistance rates and mechanisms of those pathogens are increasing worldwide. Pan-resistant (against which none of the currently available antibiotics is effective) strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been described. Encouraging is the fact that several novel compounds (some of them with mechanisms of action different to those of the antibiotics commercially available) are through the development stages. We summarize the main such compounds that show potential for offering solution to the treatment of Gram-negative multi-resistant bacteria along with the discussion of some patents associated with the topic.

AB  - Polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. An in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. Three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using USP <51> methodology. Growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except Aspergillus brasiliensis. A range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. faecalis. For A. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. The results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. Research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.
TI  - Colistin: an update on the antibiotic of the 21st century.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria that cause nosocomial infections is a growing problem worldwide. Colistin was first introduced in 1952 and was used until the early 1980s for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli. In vitro, colistin has demonstrated excellent activity against various Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria, including multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Recent clinical findings regarding colistin activity, pharmacokinetic properties, clinical uses, emerging resistance, toxicities and combination therapy have been reviewed. Recent approaches to the use of colistin in combination with other antibiotics hold promise for increased antibacterial efficacy. It is probable that colistin will be the 'last-line' therapeutic drug against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens in the 21st century.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary diffraction studies of GIM-1, a class B carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase.
AB  - GIM-1 is a member of the class B carbapenemases (metallo-beta-lactamases; MBLs) and has a wide spectrum of activity against carbapenems, penicillins and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, but not aztreonam. GIM-1 presents an enormous challenge to infection control, particularly in the eradication of Gram-negative pathogens including Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and nonfermenters. There are presently few or no drugs in late-stage development for these pathogens and GIM-1 is a potential target for the development of antimicrobial agents against pathogens producing MBLs. In this study, GIM-1 was cloned, overexpressed and crystallized. The GIM-1 crystals diffracted to 1.4 A resolution and belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 38.5, b = 67.6, c = 72.8 A. One molecule is present in the asymmetric unit, with a corresponding V(M) of 1.69 A(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 27.1%.
TI  - Adenylate kinase release as a high-throughput-screening-compatible reporter of bacterial lysis for identification of antibacterial agents.
AB  - Adenylate kinase (AK) is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is released into  the extracellular space upon cell lysis. We have shown that AK release serves as a useful reporter of bactericidal agent activity and can be exploited for antimicrobial screening purposes. The AK assay exhibits improved sensitivity over that of growth-based assays and can detect agents that are active against bacteria in clinically relevant growth states that are difficult to screen using conventional approaches, such as small colony variants (SCV) and bacteria within established biofilms. The usefulness of the AK assay was validated by screening a library of off-patent drugs for agents that exhibit antimicrobial properties toward a variety of bacterial species, including Escherichia coli and all members of the "ESKAPE" pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species). The assay detected antibiotics within the library that were expected to be active against the organism screened. Moreover, 38 drugs with no previously reported antibacterial activity elicited AK release. Four of these were acquired, and all were verified to exhibit antimicrobial activity by standard susceptibility testing. Two of these molecules were further characterized. The antihistamine, terfenadine, was active against S. aureus planktonic, SCV population, and biofilm-associated cells. Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist, was active toward E. faecium in vitro and also reduced E. faecium pathogenesis in a Galleria mellonella infection model. Our data demonstrate that the AK assay provides an attractive screening approach for identifying new antimicrobial agents. Further, terfenadine and tamoxifen may represent novel antimicrobial drug development scaffolds.
TI  - Clinical and epidemiological features of Chryseobacterium indologenes infections: analysis of 215 cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigates the clinical and epidemiological features of Chryseobacterium indologenes infections and antimicrobial susceptibilities of C indologenes. METHODS: With 215 C indologenes isolates between January 1, 2004 and September 30, 2011, at a medical center, we analyzed the relationship between the prevalence of C indologenes infections and total prescription of colistin and tigecycline, clinical manifestation, antibiotic susceptibility, and outcomes. RESULTS: Colistin and tigecycline were introduced into clinical use at this medical center since August 2006. The increasing numbers of patients with C indologenes pneumonia and bacteremia correlated to increased consumption of colistin (p = 0.018) or tigecycline (p = 0.049). Among patients with bacteremia and pneumonia, the in-hospital mortality rate was 63.6% and 35.2% (p = 0.015), respectively. Administration of appropriate antibiotics showed significant benefit in 14-day survival in patients with C indologenes bloodstream infection (p = 0.040). In bacteremic patients, old cardiovascular accident (p = 0.036) and cancer (p = 0.014) were the most common comorbidity. The most common co-infection pathogen in patients with C indologenes pneumonia was Acinetobacter baumannii (36/91, 39.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23/91, 25.3%), carbapenem-resistant A baumannii (22/91, 24.2%), and Klebseilla pneumoniae (13/91, 14.3%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 215 isolates showed that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the most active agent (susceptibility rate: 87.4%), followed by cefoperazone-sulbactam (48.0%). CONCLUSION: The present study showed a trend of increasing prevalence of C indologenes infection after introduction of colistin and tigecycline usage. The bacteremia group had higher mortality rate than the pneumonia group. Increasing resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, and newer fluoroquinolone were noticed in our analysis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was a potential antimicrobial agent in vitro for C indologenes. To avoid collateral damage, we emphasize the importance of antibiotic stewardship program.
TI  - Epidemiology and antimicrobial sensitivities of 536 multi-drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients treated on surgical wards.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, infections caused by multi-drug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacilli (GNB) are becoming more common and pose a challenge to all clinicians, including surgeons. METHODS: We evaluated the epidemiology and antimicrobial sensitivities of GNB isolated from patients treated on surgical wards at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, from 2004 to 2009. The MDR isolates were defined according to an international expert proposal supported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. RESULTS: A total of 1,153 GNB were isolated; 536 (46.5%) were MDR. The most common isolates were Escherichia coli (312 [27.8%]; MDR rate 50.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (298 [25.8%]; MDR rate 39.6%), Acinetobacter baumannii (137 [11.9%]; MDR rate 83.9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (112 [9.7%]; MDR rate 44.6%). Most pathogens were isolated from patients hospitalized in the Departments of Surgical Oncology (32.3%), Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (31.8%), General Surgery (18.1%), and Pediatric Surgery (15.5%). The clinical specimens comprised pus (45.1%), normally sterile fluids (22.5%), urine (16.8%), blood (6.3%), and other body fluids. Most effective in vitro against all MDR pathogens were colistin (83%), meropenem (57%), and imipenem-cilastatin (56%). The MDR P. aeruginosa was susceptible most often to colistin (94%) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin 56%, amikacin 55%), MDR A. baumannii only to colistin (94%), and MDR K. pneumoniae to meropenem (92%) and aminoglycosides (amikacin 76%, gentamicin 74%). CONCLUSION: In a region with a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance, almost one-half of GNB isolated from surgical patients were MDR. Surgeons may consider these developments to guide empiric antibiotic therapy for infections caused by gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Synergistic combination dry powders for inhaled antimicrobial therapy: formulation, characterization and in vitro evaluation.
AB  - In combination antimicrobial therapy, the desired outcome is to broaden the antimicrobial spectrum and to achieve a possible synergistic effect. However, adverse antagonistic species may also emerge from such combinations, leading to treatment failure with serious consequences. It is therefore imperative to screen the drug candidates for compatibility and possible antagonistic interactions. The aim of this work was to develop a novel synergistic dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation for antimicrobial combination therapy via the pulmonary route. Binary (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and gatifloxacin hydrochloride, SD-CIP/GAT) and ternary (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, gatifloxacin hydrochloride, and lysozyme, SD-CIP/GAT/LYS) combinations were prepared via spray-drying on a BUCHI(R) Nano Spray Dryer B-90. The powder morphologies were spherical with a slightly corrugated surface and all within the respirable size range. The powders yielded fine particle fractions (of the loaded dose) of over 40% when dispersed using an Aerolizer(R) at 60 L/min. Time-kill studies carried out against the respiratory tract infection-causing bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Acinetobacter baumannii at 1 x the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) over 24h revealed no antagonistic behavior for both the binary and ternary combinations. While the interactions were generally found to be indifferent, a favorable synergistic effect was detected in the dual combination (SD-CIP/GAT) when it was tested against P. aeruginosa bacteria.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance of the most frequently isolated microorganisms in the Hospital General La Mancha Centro between June 2009 and May 2010].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the last two decades an increased incidence of infections caused by multiresistant bacteria has been observed. The spread of these microorganisms in the hospital is a major therapeutic and epidemiological problem. The aim of this study was to determine local resistance patterns of microorganisms causative of multirresistant infections in patients admitted to our hospital. METHODS: A retrospective study was designed, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from clinical and surveillance samples of patients admitted to the Hospital General La Mancha Centro, between June 2009 and May 2010. RESULTS: The rate of S. aureus isolates resistant to oxacillin was 50%, with 0% resistance to vancomycin. The percentage of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins in E. coli and K. pneumoniae was 17 and 19%, respectively; the ESBL-production in enterobacterial strains was 15 and 19%, respectively, and the quinolone resistance was 41 and 28%, respectively. The resistance of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime and imipenem was 30 and 40%, respectively. Most strains of A. baumannii studied came from a single multidrug-resistant clone, endemic in the ICU of our hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Of particular concern is the high rate of MRSA, E. coli and K. pneumoniae ESBL producers and resistant to fluoroquinolones as well as P. aeruginosa multiresistant. A. baumannii isolates belong mainly to endemic multidrug-resistant clone from the ICU.
TI  - Nitric oxide (NO)-induced death of gram-negative bacteria from a light-controlled NO-releasing platform.
AB  - A NO-delivery platform has been fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Pluronic((R)) F127 gel that contains the light-sensitive NO donor, [Mn(PaPy(3))(NO)]ClO(4). The material was assembled layer-by-layer. First, a thin PDMS membrane was cast. It was then layered with cold 25% (w/v) Pluronic((R)) F127 gel mixed with [Mn(PaPy(3))(NO)]ClO(4). Finally, it was covered with a thick layer (nearly impermeable to NO) of PDMS (=polydimethoxysiloxane) to allow release of NO only from the thinner side upon exposure to light. Light-induced NO release from this layered material has been confirmed via NO-specific electrode and by a modified soft Griess-agar assay. Incorporation of ca. 8 mg/g of [Mn(PaPy(3))(NO)]ClO(4) in the Pluronic gel layer affords a material that drastically reduces the microbial loads of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa via the antibiotic effects of the photoreleased NO. Application of this flexible layered NO-donating composite as bandage material has been proposed.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characterization of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize mechanical ventilation-associated pneumonia (MVAP). METHOD: This is an observational descriptive study to characterize MVAP in 61 ventilated patients admitted in the intensive care units of the Hermanos Ameijeiras hospital during 2011. This study also aimed to isolate the bacteria causing MVAP and characterize their resistance to antibiotics. RESULTS: 51 (83.60%) patients presented pulmonary infiltrates and 35 (50.81%) presented a clinical score >/= 6 according to the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score. Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated microorganisms from patients with MVAP. Both microorganisms showed a high resistance to antibiotics. Carbapenems were the most frequent used antimicrobial therapeutic agents; elective antibiotic combinations were directed against both bacterial wall structure and nucleic acid synthesis. CONCLUSION: Patients with MVAP identified during the studied period showed similar frequency to those reported in medical literature. Thus, this study corroborated that this is still a relevant medical problem in this hospital. Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated microorganisms from patients with MVAP. Antimicrobial treatment, empirical or not, are still the main risk factors for the development of multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria. The rate of resistance to antibiotics of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from patients with MVAP was higher than those isolated from infected patients without MAVP. Tigecycline and colistin were the only antibiotics fully effective against Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated in 2011 from patients with MVAP; against Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, only colistin was fully effective.
TI  - The effect of d-amino acid substitution on the selectivity of temporin L towards  target cells: identification of a potent anti-Candida peptide.
AB  - The frog skin peptide temporin L (TL, 13-residues long) has a wide and potent spectrum of antimicrobial activity, but it is also toxic on mammalian cells at its microbicidal concentrations. Previous studies have indicated that its analogue [Pro(3)]TL has a slightly reduced hemolytic activity and a stable helical conformation along residues 6-13. Here, to expand our knowledge on the relationship between the extent/position of alpha-helix in TL and its biological activities, we systematically replaced single amino acids within the alpha-helical domain of [Pro(3)]TL with the corresponding d isomers, known as helix breakers. Structure-activity relationship studies of these analogues, by means of CD and NMR spectroscopy analyses as well as antimicrobial and hemolytic assays were performed. Besides increasing our understanding on the structural elements that are responsible for cell selectivity of TL, this study revealed that a single l to d amino acid substitution can preserve strong anti-Candida activity of [Pro(3)]TL, without giving a toxic effect towards human cells.
TI  - Oxybiotest project: microorganisms under pressure. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) and simple pressure interaction on selected bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: HyperBaric Oxygen (HBO) therapy involves exposure to pure oxygen in a pressurized room, and it is an already well-established treatment for various conditions, including those originated by serious infections. Starting from the observation of an increased number of patients who were accessing our HBO units for diseases supported from concomitant multidrug-resistant microorganisms, as well as considering the evident clinical benefit and laboratory final outcome of those patients at the end of the treatment, aim of our study was to measure, or better define at least, if there was any interaction between a hyperbaric environment and some selected microorganisms and if those positive results were due to the increased oxygen partial pressure (pO2) value or just to the increased pressure, regardless of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) applied (21/100%). DESIGN AND METHODS: We applied various increased pO2 values in a hyperbaric environment. Our study design was tailored in four steps to answer four specific questions, ordered in a progressive process: OxyBioTest (OBT)-1,2,3, and 4. Specifically, we chose to investigate possible changes in the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and in the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of multi-resistant microorganisms after a single session of hyperbaric therapy. RESULTS: OBT-1 and OBT-2 provide a semi-quantitative confirmation of the bacterio-cidal and cytostatic effects of HBO. HBO is cidal only if the total exposure pressure is elevated, and cidal or cytostatic effect are not always dependent on the pO2 applied.OBT-4 has shown the adjuvant effect of HBO and antimicrobial drug against some selected bacteria. DISCUSSION: We seem allowed to hypothesize that only in case of a good approach to a lesion, permitting smaller bacterial loads thanks to surgical debridement and/or eventual antibiotic therapy for example, You can observe the clear effectiveness of the HyperBaric Oxygen (HBO) exposure as a valid adjuvant therapy, even when that lesion is substained from multidrug-resistant micro-organisms. On the contrary when the bacterial load is very high we observe an unchanged situation or a just a slightly diminishing in the number of cfu/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Even if confined in this 'in vitro' environment and in a single treatment, just knowing the microorganism strain responsible of the lesion we seem allowed to both weight the possible related effectiveness using HBO Therapy (HBOT) and derive the best pO2 to treat the case. A further possible development of the study highlights a comparison between Acinetobacter baumannii (ACBA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSAE), and Escherichia coli (ESCO) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (KLPN).
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 'old' polymyxins: what is new?
AB  - 'Old' colistin and polymyxin B are increasingly used as last-line therapy against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. For intravenous administration, colistin is dosed as its inactive prodrug colistin methanesulfonate (sodium), while polymyxin B is used as its sulfate (active antibacterial). Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in understanding their chemistry, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD). The first scientifically based dosing suggestions are now available for colistin methanesulfonate to generate a desired target steady-state plasma concentration of formed colistin in various categories of critically ill patients. As simply increasing polymyxin dosage regimens is not an option for optimizing their PK/PD due to nephrotoxicity, combination therapy with other antibiotics has great potential to maximize the efficacy of polymyxins while minimizing emergence of resistance. We must pursue rational approaches to the use of polymyxins and other existing antibiotics through the application of PK/PD principles.
TI  - National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Funding for Studies  of Hospital-Associated Bacterial Pathogens: Are Funds Proportionate to Burden of Disease?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-associated infections (HAIs) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. The pathogens that cause the majority of serious HAIs are Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species, referred as ESCKAPE. We aimed to determine the amount of funding the National Institute of Health (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly ESCKAPE pathogens. METHODS: The NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT) database was used to identify NIAID antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." RESULTS: Funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. Antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. The total funding for all ESKCAPE pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. S. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in FY2009, the highest funding amount of all the ESCKAPE pathogens. Based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per S. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per C. difficile related death. CONCLUSIONS: Although the funding for ESCKAPE pathogens has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. Efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.
TI  - Prevention and treatment of virulent bacterial biofilms with an enzymatic nitric  oxide-releasing dressing.
AB  - The use of percutaneous medical devices often results in nosocomial infections. Attachment of microorganisms to the surfaces of these medical devices triggers biofilm formation, which presents significant complications to the health of a patient and may lead to septicemia, thromboembolism, or endocarditis if not correctly treated. Although several antimicrobials are commonly used for prevention of biofilm formation, they have limited efficacy against formed biofilms. In this study, we report the use of an enzymatic, gaseous nitric oxide (gNO)-releasing dressing for the prevention and treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Results show that the bactericidal activity against biofilms of the test strains was dependent on time and rate of gNO release from the dressing. Following 6 h of treatment, gNO-releasing dressings significantly inhibited the growth of test strains relative to vehicle control dressings, demonstrating eradication of bacterial concentrations of up to 10(5) CFU/cm(2). Complete cell death was observed for both prevention of biofilm formation and treatment of 24-h-grown biofilms after 6 h of treatment with the gNO-releasing dressings. Further, gNO-releasing dressings were more efficient against formed biofilms than other antimicrobial agents currently used. These results demonstrate that the gNO-releasing dressing can produce sufficient levels of gNO over a therapeutically relevant duration for maximal bactericidal effects against virulent bacterial strains known to cause nosocomial infections.
TI  - [The clinical efficacy and safety of panipenem-betamipron in treatment of moderate to severe pulmonary infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of intravenous panipenem-betamipron in the treatment of moderate to severe pulmonary infection. METHODS: An open, perspective, multicenter clinical trial was conducted. Among the enrolled 665 patients, 621 patients with moderate to severe pulmonary infection were treated with intravenous panipenem-betamipron at a dose of 500 mg every 6 hours per day for 7 - 14 days. Among them, the community acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) patients were 55.6% (345/621), 37.0% (230/621) and 7.4% (46/621), respectively. All the adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: The overall effective rate of panipenem-betamipron was 84.4% with CAP of 91.9%, HAP of 76.1% and VAP of 69.6%. The effective rates in the patients with moderate and severe pulmonary infection were 87.5% and 82.8%, respectively. Bacterial separation rate was 54.8% and bacterial eradication rate was 80.9%. Bacterial eradication rates to pseudomonas aeruginosa, pneumobacillus, Escherichia coli. and acinetobacter baumannii were 74.7%, 95.6%, 89.5% and 50.9%, respectively. The adverse events rate was 1.8% (12/665). CONCLUSION: Intravenous panipenem-betamipron is effective in treating moderate to severe pulmonary infection with low adverse events rate.
TI  - Ceftazidime for respiratory infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ceftazidime is a third-generation cephalosporin that has activity against Gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and the limited number of antimicrobial agents in development have necessitated a review of the current status of treatments involving ceftazidime. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on studies examining the in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftazidime against recent clinical isolates and recent randomized controlled trials studying the clinical efficacy of ceftazidime, and discusses strategies for the optimal use of ceftazidime for treating respiratory tract infections, mainly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). EXPERT OPINION: Although ceftazidime remains an important option for HAP treatment, its role as an effective antimicrobial agent has been compromised by the sharp increase in resistance rates over the last decade, especially in P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. To maintain or improve the clinical use of ceftazidime in patients with severe HAP, it will be essential to gain a thorough understanding of local resistance patterns, reserve ceftazidime use when pathogens are susceptible to other third-generation cephalosporins, optimize ceftazidime therapy using prolonged or continuous infusion, determine the effectiveness of the combination of ceftazidime with inhibitors of broad-spectrum beta-lactamases and role of combination therapy for P. aeruginosa infections, and judiciously use antimicrobial agents through individualization of antimicrobial therapy for HAP.
TI  - The role of maxillary sinus puncture on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hospital-acquired rhinosinusitis.
AB  - Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common causes of fever of unknown origin in critically ill patients and should be systematically searched. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic effect of maxillary sinus puncture performed at the bedside in patients with infective rhinosinusitis hospitalized in an Intensive Care Unit of a high complexity care hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study looks into patients on mechanical ventilation with fever of unknown origin and signs of rhinosinusitis on CT images who were submitted to inferior meatus maxillary sinus puncture. RESULTS: The total study sample consisted of 27 patients (70.3% male; mean age 45.3 years). The most common Intensive Care Unit admission diagnoses were head trauma and stroke. CT scans revealed the maxillary (85.2%) and sphenoid (74.1%) sinuses were the most involved paranasal sinuses. Middle meatus purulent drainage was seen in 30.7% of the nasal cavities. Fever was reduced in 70.4% of the patients after puncture (p < 0.001). The most commonly found organisms in sinus aspirates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: Maxillary sinus puncture performed at the bedside of the patients is an important diagnostic and therapeutic tool for critically ill patients.
TI  - Cationic amphiphilic alpha-helical peptides for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, in particular Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is a critical clinical problem worldwide. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have received increasing attention due to their ability to overcome multidrug-resistant microbes. We recently reported that cysteine-functionalized alpha-helical peptides LLKKLLKKC and CLLKKLLKKC effectively eradicated Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. In this study, the antibacterial properties of these peptides against carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates of A. baumannii were studied both in vitro and in vivo. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the peptides against 20 clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii were determined in comparison with imipenem. The results showed that the A. baumannii isolates were more susceptible to (LLKK)(2)C than to C(LLKK)(2)C in vitro, and 90% of the 20 tested strains had an MIC of lower than or equal to 36.8 and 63.1 mumol/L, respectively. However, the bactericidal effect of C(LLKK)(2)C was much faster than that of (LLKK)(2)C. Furthermore, these peptides also showed excellent potency in mouse models of peritonitis and pneumonia infections caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Importantly, both peptides had a high therapeutic index (>25), but caused no significant adverse effects on the liver and kidney functions and the balance of electrolytes in the blood. These peptides can be a promising alternative treatment modality to traditional antibiotics for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, especially carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Laboratory confirmed bloodstream infection aetiology in an intensive care unit: eight years study.
AB  - To evaluate laboratory confirmed bloodstream infection (LC-BSI) aetiology we carried out a prospective study in the general 13 bed ICU of the teaching hospital Policlinico Umberto I in Rome. According to CDC case definitions for LC-BSI, all patients admitted >48h between 2000-2007 to ICU were included. Risk factors (i.e. age, sex, SAPS II), invasive procedures (i.e. endotracheal intubation, vascular and urinary catheterisation), microbiological isolates and their antibiotic susceptibility were screened. Overall 1741 patients (64.8% males, 35.2% females) were included, mean age was 58.1 +/- 19.8, SAPS II score 45.1 +/- 17 and ICU stay 14.0 +/- 21.1 days. Finally, 167 (9.6%) patients developed 203 (11.7%) ICU-acquired LC-BSI and sources of infection were CVC (39.8%), unknown (39.3%), respiratory tract (12.4%), surgical wound (6.5%) and urinary tract (2.0%). Between 2000 and 2007 the incidence of LC-BSI/1000 patient days (14.8 per thousands vs. 7.8 per thousands: p<0.05) and LC-BSI/1000 CVC days (20.7 per thousands vs. 11.4 per thousands; p<0.05) decreased. The onset of infection followed ICU admission by 19.5 +/- 17.7 (mean) and 13 days (median). Crude mortality was 34.8%, and mortality associated with LC-BSI showed a RR 1.61; 95%CI 1.37 - 1.89; p<0.01. The most common pathogens were coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (26.2%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (14.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.5%), enterococci (9.3%) and Acinetobacter bawnumannii (7.5%). Onset time (days) between ICU admission and LC-BSI was higher (p<0.01) among Gram-negative (22.9 +/- 18.4) compared to Gram-positive (16.6 +/- 15.9), fungi (23.8 +/- 25.3). High early death (<7 days after BSI diagnosis) was associated to A. baumannii (37.5%), Candida spp. (30.0%) and S. aureus (29.7%). Staphylococci presented a very high methicillin resistance (>85%). P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii showed respectively 25% and 68.7% multidrug-resistance. Over 1/3 of Eneterobacteriaceae isolates were extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), but non resulted resistant to carbapenems. Surveillance showed a high incidence of LC-BSI associated to invasive procedures and the presence of multiresistant bacteria.
TI  - In vivo-validated essential genes identified in Acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  - A critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. For bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media. This study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. Mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. A subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. The putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, DNA/RNA synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. These A. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other Gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the Database of Essential Genes (DEG), including those of Acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. However, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. None of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of FDA-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. IMPORTANCE: The human pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. This scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective against antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Escherichia coli. This study identified a set of A. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. Furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the Database of Essential Genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. Lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria has been identified.
TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of pathogenic bacteria from hospitalized trauma patients who survived Wenchuan earthquake.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the microbiological characterization  of pathogenic bacteria isolated from trauma patients after Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. Most infections were identified in the patients over 60 years of age, with an incidence rate of 78.5%, and more infections in wound (43.3%) and respiratory tract (37.1%) sites were identified. A total of 97 non-duplicated clinical pathogens were isolated from 91 trauma patients. Of those pathogens, 62 (63.9%) were Gram-negative bacilli, 23 (23.7%) were Gram-positive cocci, 9 (9.3%) were fungi, and 3 (3.1%) were anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens. The distribution spectrum of pathogens isolated from trauma patients after earthquake was different to that from non-earthquake trauma patients in our hospital at the same time. The most prevalent pathogenic isolates were Escherichia coli (15.4%), Acinetobacter baumannii (14.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.3%), Burkholderia cepacia (11.3%), and Enterococcus spp. (9.3%). The drug susceptibility results showed that most of the Gram-negative bacilli, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, were susceptible to imipenem, but resistant to the first- and the second-generation cephalosporins. Most of the Gram-positive cocci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and Synercid/dalfopristin. Characteristics of pathogenic bacterium isolated from trauma patients after earthquake have been demonstrated which play an important role in the appropriate treatment of infections.
TI  - Assessment of the Phoenix automated system and EUCAST breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing against isolates expressing clinically relevant resistance mechanisms.
AB  - EUCAST breakpoint criteria are being adopted by automatic antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems. The accuracy of the Phoenix Automated System in combination with 2012 EUCAST breakpoints against recent clinical isolates was evaluated. A total of 697 isolates (349 Enterobacteriaceae, 113 Pseudomonas spp., 25 Acinetobacter baumannii, 11 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 95 Staphylococcus aureus, 6 coagulase negative staphylococci, 77 enterococci and 21 Streptococcus pneumoniae) with defined resistance phenotypes and well-characterized resistance mechanisms recovered in Spain (n = 343) and Italy (n = 354) were tested. Comparator antimicrobial susceptibility testing data were obtained following CLSI guidelines. Experimental agreement (EA), defined as MIC agreement +/-1 log(2) dilution, category agreement (CA) and relative discrepancies (minor (mD), major (MD) and very major discrepancies (VMD)) were determined. The overall EA and CA for all organism-antimicrobial agent combinations (n = 6.294) were 97.3% and 95.2%, respectively. mD, MD and VMD were 4.7%, 1.3% and 2.7%, all of them in agreement with the ISO (ISO20776-2:2007) acceptance criteria for assessment of susceptibility testing devices. VMD were mainly observed in amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefuroxime in Enterobacteriaceae and gentamicin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas MD were mainly observed in amoxicillin-clavulante in Enterobacteriaceae. mD were mainly observed in Enterobacteriaceae but distributed in different antimicrobials. For S. aureus and enterococci relative discrepancies were low. The Phoenix system showed accuracy assessment in accordance with the ISO standards when using EUCAST breakpoints. Inclusion of EUCAST criteria in automatic antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems will facilitate the implementation of EUCAST breakpoints in clinical microbiology laboratories.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the potential for resistance development to ceragenin CSA-13.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Though most bacteria remain susceptible to endogenous antimicrobial peptides, specific resistance mechanisms are known. As mimics of antimicrobial peptides, ceragenins were expected to retain antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, even after prolonged exposure. Serial passaging of bacteria to a lead ceragenin, CSA-13, was performed with representative pathogenic bacteria. Ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and colistin were used as comparators. The mechanisms of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria were elucidated. METHODS: Susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were serially exposed to CSA-13 and comparators for 30 passages. MIC values were monitored. Alterations in the Gram-negative bacterial membrane composition were characterized via mass spectrometry and the susceptibility of antimicrobial-peptide-resistant mutants to CSA-13 was evaluated. RESULTS: S. aureus became highly resistant to ciprofloxacin after <20 passages. After 30 passages, the MIC values of vancomycin and CSA-13 for S. aureus increased 9- and 3-fold, respectively. The Gram-negative organisms became highly resistant to ciprofloxacin after <20 passages. MIC values of colistin for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii increased to >/=100 mg/L after 20 passages. MIC values of CSA-13 increased to approximately 20-30 mg/L and plateaued over the course of the experiment. Bacteria resistant to CSA-13 displayed lipid A modifications that are found in organisms resistant to antimicrobial peptides. CONCLUSIONS: CSA-13 retained potent antibacterial activity against S. aureus over the course of 30 serial passages. Resistance generated in Gram-negative bacteria correlates with modifications to the outer membranes of these organisms and was not stable outside of the presence of the antimicrobial.
TI  - Doripenem vs meropenem against Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter.
AB  - Recently, doripenem has been approved for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (NP), including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The E-test was performed to determine the MICs of doripenem and meropenem in 203 endotracheal aspirate isolates that consisted of 140 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complexes and 63 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Doripenem showed minimum concentration necessary for inhibition of 50% (MIC 50 ) of P. aeruginosa isolates at 0.38 mg/L which is several times (84.2 times) lower than the corresponding MIC 50 value of >32 mg/L for meropenem. The MIC 50 and MIC 90 were similar for both the drugs against A. baumannii. Thus, P. aeruginosa was consistently more susceptible than the A. baumannii.
TI  - Is there a direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type A?
AB  - Study Type--Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence 4. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Several studies describe a reduction of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after intradetrusor injections of botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A). It was, however, unclear if a direct antibacterial effect of BoNT/A plays a role in this clinical observation. This is the first study to investigate a potential antibacterial effect of two frequently used BoNT/A formulations (i.e. Botox(R) and Dysport(R)), providing evidence that BoNT/A does not exert an antibacterial effect on lower urinary tract pathogens. OBJECTIVE: * To determine a potential direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A). MATERIALS AND METHODS: * A prospective study was carried out using onabotulinumtoxin A (Botox(R)) and abobotulinumtoxin A (Dypsort(R)) in agar diffusion and broth microdilution assays with various clinical urinary tract isolates (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca and Bacillus subtilis). * Inhibition zones (mm) of bacteria around a disc containing 20 microL saline with 4 IU of Botox(R) were measured in the agar diffusion assay. * Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs, IU/mL) of both toxins for all bacteria were determined in the broth microdilution assay after overnight incubation at 35 degrees C. RESULTS: * There was no inhibition zone in the agar diffusion assays with any bacterial strain. * The microdilution test using Botox(R) and Dysport(R) showed bacterial growth in all dilutions, i.e. MICs > 20 and >100 IU/mL for Botox(R) and Dysport(R), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: * BoNT/A has no direct antimicrobial effect. * The reduced frequency of symptomatic urinary tract infections (sUTIs) in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) after BoNT/A intradetrusor injections seems to be caused by different indirect mechanisms, which are still not completely understood.
TI  - N-acyl homoserine lactone mediated interspecies interactions between A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are pathogens capable of colonizing the same infection sites and employing N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) based quorum-sensing systems to co-ordinate biofilm formation. Hence, the effect of P. aeruginosa AHLs on biofilm formation by A. baumannii and vice versa were investigated using the biofilm impaired quorum sensing mutants, A. baumannii M2 (abaI::Km) and P. aeruginosa PAO-JP2. Complementing the mutants with heterologous, extracted and pure AHLs increased biofilm mass significantly. The surface area coverage and biovolume also increased significantly as observed by confocal scanning laser microscopy which corroborated scanning electron microscope analysis. Autoinducer synthase gene promoters of A. baumannii, P( abaI)-lacZ, and P. aeruginosa, P( lasI)-lacZ, were induced (p < 0.05) by heterologous AHLs. Growth of A. baumannii was not inhibited by pyocyanin of P. aeruginosa which may allow their co-existence and interaction in the clinical setting, thereby affecting the severity of combined infections and therapeutic measures to control them.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of iron chelators against common nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - The activities of iron chelators (deferoxamine, deferiprone, Apo6619, and VK28) were evaluated against type strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Deferiprone, Apo6619, and VK28 each inhibited growth in standard and RPMI tissue culture medium, while deferoxamine had no effect. Additionally, time-kill assays revealed that VK28 had a bacteriostatic effect against S. aureus. Therefore, these newly developed iron chelators might provide a nontraditional approach for treatment of bacterial infections.
TI  - Rapid identification of ESKAPE bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  - This article describes Bacteria ID Chips ('BacChips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. BacChips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. Pressing the layer of PDMS into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). After assembly, BacChips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. To use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased PDMS draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. After the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air is drawn into the BacChip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. A pH indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. Importantly, BacChips operate without external equipment or instruments. By visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that BacChips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the ESKAPE panel of pathogens, including strains of: Enterococcus faecalis, Enteroccocus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. This article describes a BacChip for point-of-care detection of ESKAPE pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.
TI  - Volatile compound profiling for the identification of Gram-negative bacteria by ion-molecule reaction-mass spectrometry.
AB  - AIMS: Fast and reliable methods for the early detection and identification of micro-organism are of high interest. In addition to established methods, direct mass spectrometry-based analysis of volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by micro-organisms has recently been shown to allow species differentiation. Thus, a large number of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, which comprised Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens, were subjected to headspace VC composition analysis using direct mass spectrometry in a low sample volume that allows for automation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ion-molecule reaction-mass spectrometry (IMR-MS) was applied to headspace analysis of the above bacterial samples incubated at 37 degrees C starting with 10(2) CFU ml(-1) . Measurements of sample VC composition were performed at 4, 8 and 24 h. Microbial growth was detected in all samples after 8 h. After 24 h, species-specific mass spectra were obtained allowing differentiation between bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: IMR-MS provided rapid growth detection and identification of micro-organisms using a cumulative end-point model with a short analysis time of 3 min per sample. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Following further validation, the presented method of bacterial sample headspace VC analysis has the potential to be used for bacteria differentiation.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii against carbapenems, colistin, and tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii ) against carbapenems along with colistin and tigecycline as alternative therapeutic options. METHODS: A total of 117 strains of multidrug-resistant (MDR) non-fermenting Gram negative bacteria isolated from non-duplicate samples were collected consecutively. We included one sample from each patient (84 isolates of A. baumannii and 33 isolates of P. aeruginosa isolated from patients seen at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from June to December 2010). Isolates were identified by the MicroScan WalkAway 96 Plus system. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by E-test following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint recommendations. RESULTS: Most A. baumannii strains were resistant to imipenem (90.5%), meropenem (90.5%), and doripenem (77.4%). Whereas, a higher percentage of P. aeruginosa was resistant to imipenem (90.9%), and meropenem (81.8%), only 39.4% were resistant to doripenem. Colistin had excellent activity against both A. baumannii (100%) and P. aeruginosa (93.9%), while 89.3% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to tigecycline. CONCLUSION: Among the carbapenems, doripenem was found to be the most potent antimicrobial agent against P. aeruginosa, whereas colistin proved to be an effective alternative antimicrobial agent for treatment of A. baumannii or P. aeruginosa. Tigecycline remains the best therapeutic option for MDR A. baumannii.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of inhaled colistimethate sodium (CMS) in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe inhaled colistin pharmacokinetics in patients with ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) due to polymyxin-only susceptible Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). METHODS: Inhaled colistimethate sodium (CMS) was administered at a dose of 80 mg every 8 h for 7 days. Mini bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed before and at 1, 4 and 8 h, while blood samples were collected before and at 0.16, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after the first dose. Colistin concentrations in BAL and serum were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Our study population included 20 patients. At the end of treatment, cure was achieved in 16 patients and favorable microbiological response in 12 patients. Median (25-75 % interquartile range) colistin concentrations in epithelial lining fluid (ELF) were 6.7 (4.8-10.1), 3.9 (2.5-6.0) and 2.0 (1.0-3.8) mug/ml at 1, 4 and 8 h, respectively, and fivefold higher than those achieved in serum. Median ELF concentrations at 1 and 4 h were above the minimum inhibitory concentrations of all isolated pathogens; however, the 4-h median was below the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Guidelines (EUCAST) breakpoints for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the 8-h median was low relative to EUCAST breakpoints for all GNB. Colistin pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters in ELF were associated with favorable microbiological response at the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: Inhaled colistin may achieve high drug concentrations in the lung. However, a dose of 80 mg of inhaled CMS every 8 h may not be adequate for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections due to multi-drug resistant GNB.
TI  - [Occurrence of alert pathogens in hospital environment Part II. Multidrug-resistant non-fermenting bacilli].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multidrug-resistant gram-negative non-fermenting bacilli are an important cause of nosocomial infection. Aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of rods of the species Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, belonging to multidrug-resistant alert pathogens. METHODS: 105 (70%) strains of A. baumannii and 46 (30%) strains of P. aeruginosa were isolated from 125 patients hospitalized in the Specialistic Hospital in Krakow, in the years 2008-2010. Taken into account first isolate from the patient. The condition for inclusion in the study was the resistance or reduced susceptibility to selected groups of antibiotics, such as beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. Bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed by automated system Vitek 2 Compact (bioMerieux, Poland). All strains were tested with phenotypic method Etest MBL (AB Biodisk, Sweden) for the presence of resistance mechanism associated with the production of metallo-beta-lactamases. RESULTS: Bacilli of the species A. baumannii were isolated most frequently from patients from the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (52%) and Burn Therapy Unit (25%), with clinical materials collected from the respiratory tract (51%), the wound swabs (18%), urine (11%) and blood (11%). Production of metallo-beta-lactamases was found in 24 (22.9%) strains of A. baumannii. Drugs effective against multidrug-resistant isolates of A. baumannii were colistin and amikacin. Department of anesthesiology and intensive care (59%) and unit of internal medicine (11%) were the main source of multidrug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa. Pathogens were mainly isolated from clinical specimens collected from the respiratory tract (61%), urine (15%) and wound swabs (13%). Seven (15.2%) strains of P. aeruginosa produced the metallo-beta-lactamases. With regard to colistin and piperacillin with tazobactam was noted the highest percentage of susceptible isolates. CONCLUSIONS: MDR bacteria belonging to alert pathogens are an important cause of many severe and difficult to treat infections which greatly increases the morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients worldwide. Epidemiological studies and detection of local resistance patterns can provide useful information which can be used in the development of strategies to combat the rising tide of microbial antibiotic resistance.
TI  - [Analysis of distribution characteristics and drug resistance of 2748 strains of  pathogens isolated from burn patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide epidemiological data of the distribution characteristics and drug resistance of the pathogens isolated from burn patients in recent years for guiding rational use of antibiotics in clinic. METHODS: Totally 2748 strains of pathogens were isolated from 1977 specimens (blood, catheter, wound excretion, etc.) collected from 478 patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital from March 2003 to June 2011. After being identified by API strips, drug resistance of the 2748 isolated pathogens to 55 commonly-used antibiotics including gentamicin, tobramycin, piperacillin, amikacin, etc. was tested by K-B paper disk diffusion method. The WHONET 5.3 software was used to analyze the following subjects: the distribution of the pathogens with different types and different sources each year, the changes in drug-resistant rates of Gram negative bacilli, Gram positive cocci, and fungi to several antibiotics, and the changes in sensitive rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Candida albicans (CA) to several antibiotics. RESULTS: Among 2748 strains of pathogens, 1879 strains of Gram negative bacilli accounted for 68.38%, 628 strains of Gram positive cocci accounted for 22.85%, and 241 strains of fungi accounted for 8.77%. The isolation rate of strains from wound excretion ranked the first (1022 strains accounted for 37.19%), followed by those from respiratory tract (995 strains accounted for 36.21%) and blood (421 strains accounted for 15.32%). Strains isolated from other types of specimens were rare. Isolation rate of PA ranked the first (996 strains accounted for 36.24%), followed by SA (495 strains accounted for 18.01%) and AB (395 strains accounted for 14.37%). Isolation rate of AB showed a trend of increase year by year, but that of SA presented the opposite trend. Isolation rate of PA was quite stable. There were 484 strains of methicillin resistant SA among Staphylococci, accounting for 17.61%. Resistant rates of PA and AB to polymyxin B and polymyxin E were below 30.00%, and those of PA and AB to other antibiotics, such as the third generation cephalosporins, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, were from 57.91% to 100.00%. Resistant rate of AB to minocycline was 39.68%. From 2004 to 2011, sensitive rate of PA to quinolone antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year, but that of AB to minocycline, netilmicin, imipenem, meropenem, tobramycin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam presented the opposite trend. Resistant rates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and SA to teicoplanin and linezolid were less than 10.00%. Resistant rate of SA, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium to vancomycin was 0. Resistant rates of SA to quinupristin/dalfopristin, minocycline, fusidic acid, and compound sulfamethoxazole were low, respectively 0.82%, 9.35%, 2.21%, and 31.85%. Sensitive rates of SA to erythromycin, clindamycin, compound sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and minocycline showed an increasing trend year by year. Both infection rate and resistant rate of fungi were low. The resistant rates of CA to 5 kinds of antibiotics were less than 15.00%. The sensitive rate of CA to 5-flucytosine declined slightly, and those of CA to the other 4 antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year. CONCLUSIONS: The three dominant pathogens that cause infection in burn patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital in recent years are PA, SA, and AB in order. PA and AB are outstandingly multidrug-resistant among the isolated strains. AB might replace PA as the main pathogenic bacterium that cause the death of burn patients with infection.
TI  - Evaluation of clinical outcomes in patients with bloodstream infections due to Gram-negative bacteria according to carbapenem MIC stratification.
AB  - Predictive modeling suggests that actual carbapenem MIC results are more predictive of clinical patient outcomes than categorical classification of the MIC as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant. Some have speculated that current CLSI guidelines' suggested thresholds are too high and that clinical success is more likely if the MIC value is </=1 mg/liter for certain organisms. Patients treated with carbapenems and with positive blood cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria were considered for evaluation in this clinical retrospective cohort study. Relevant patient demographics and microbiologic variables were collected, including carbapenem MIC. The primary objective was to define a risk-adjusted all-cause hospital mortality breakpoint for carbapenem MICs. Secondarily, we sought to determine if a similar breakpoint existed for indirect outcomes (e.g., time to mortality and length of stay [LOS] postinfection for survivors). Seventy-one patients met the criteria for study inclusion. Overall, 52 patients survived, and 19 died. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis determined a split of organism MIC between 2 and 4 mg/liter and predicted differences in mortality (16.1% versus 76.9%; P < 0.01). Logistic regression controlling for confounders identified each imipenem MIC doubling dilution as increasing the probability of death 2-fold (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 3.2). Secondary outcomes were similar between groups. This study revealed that patients with organisms that had a MIC of >/=4 mg/liter had worse outcomes than patients whose isolates had a MIC of </=2 mg/liter, even after adjustment for confounding variables. We recommend additional clinical studies to better understand the susceptibility breakpoint for carbapenems.
TI  - Clinical experience of tigecycline treatment in infections caused by extensively  drug-resistant Acinetobacter spp.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tigecycline has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and is approved for complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and community-acquired pneumonia. There are few data on clinical experience of tigecycline in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and Acinetobacter spp. infection. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed at eight hospitals in Korea from May 2009 to January 2010. Adult patients treated with tigecycline regardless of their source of infection or pathogens were enrolled. RESULTS: Tigecycline was administered in 108 patients. Pneumonia was the most common infection (43.5%), followed by skin and soft tissue infections (20.4%). Acinetobacter baumannii was isolated from 83 patients (76.9%) accounting for 50.3% of isolated pathogens, showing a resistance rate of 67.5% to carbapenems. Superinfection was identified in 32 patients (29.6%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most common microorganism causing superinfection (46.9%). Overall 30-day mortality rate was 52.9%. Thirty-day mortality rate of HAP and Acinetobacter spp. infection was 60.5% and 59.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline can be considered as an alternative therapy in patients with HAP or infections caused by Acinetobacter spp., especially extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - [Antibiotic-resistant bacteria and new directions of antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  - The emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms are becoming more and  more serious and are a worldwide problem. Recent trends in new antibiotic-resistant organisms include multiple-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP), MDR-Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) and New Deli metallo beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) -producing bacteria. Antibiotic combination therapy is an option to overcome these MDR organisms. A breakpoint checkerboard plate was created to measure antibiotic combination effects at breakpoint concentrations, making it possible to evaluate the synergy of antibiotic combination within 24 hours. In this article, recent topics regarding antibiotic-resistant organisms are briefly reviewed and the directions of antibiotic chemotherapy against these organisms are discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of non-fermenting Gram-negative isolates to isepamicin in a region with high antibiotic resistance.
AB  - The alarmingly increasing resistance rates among non-fermenting Gram-negative species, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, intensified the interest in alternative antibiotic treatment options. Isepamicin, an old aminoglycoside, may play a role in the treatment of patients with infections caused by those multi-drug resistant pathogens. We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of isepamicin against non-fermenting Gram-negative isolates collected of the microbiological laboratory at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece from 2004 to the first trimester of 2011. We tested a total of 4,219 isolates (66.2 % Pseudomonas spp., 30 % Acinetobacter spp., 3.8 % other non-fermenters). The lower respiratory tract, pus, and urine were the most frequent sites of isolation (29.7 %, 19.9 %, and 12.9 %, respectively). Overall, 2768 (65.6 %) of the evaluated isolates were susceptible to isepamicin (including 79.9 % of Pseudomonas spp, 37.2 % of Acinetobacter spp, 43.1 % of other non-fermenters). Isepamicin exhibited higher antimicrobial activity compared to broad spectrum penicillins, cephalosporins, other aminoglycosides, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. Only colistin was more active than isepamicin. Additionally, 41.7 % of carbapenem-resistant and 53.2 % of colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to isepamicin. The susceptibility rates for the respective types of A. baumannii isolates were 12 % and 6.2 %. Yet, isepamicin was active against 29.2 % of A. baumannii that were resistant to all other tested aminoglycosides. Isepamicin exhibits considerable antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative non-fermenters in a region with high antimicrobial resistance. Particularly, isepamicin may provide a therapeutic option for infections from carbapenem- and colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa and other aminoglycoside-resistant A. baumannii. Further modifications in the aminoglycoside molecule may provide formulations with enhanced antimicrobial activity.
TI  - In vitro synergy of colistin combinations against colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates.
AB  - Colistin resistance, although uncommon, is increasingly being reported among Gram-negative clinical pathogens, and an understanding of its impact on the activity of antimicrobials is now evolving. We evaluated the potential for synergy of colistin plus trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1/19 ratio), or vancomycin against 12 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4). The strains included six multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, A. baumannii ATCC 19606, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and their colistin-resistant derivatives (KPm1, ABm1, and PAm1, respectively). Antimicrobial susceptibilities were assessed by broth microdilution and population analysis profiles. The potential for synergy of colistin combinations was evaluated using a checkerboard assay, as well as static time-kill experiments at 0.5x and 0.25x MIC. The MIC ranges of vancomycin, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1/19) were >/=128, 4 to >/=128, and 2/38 to >128/2,432 mug/ml, respectively. Colistin resistance demonstrated little impact on vancomycin, trimethoprim, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole MIC values. Isolates with subpopulations heterogeneously resistant to colistin were observed to various degrees in all tested isolates. In time-kill assays, all tested combinations were synergistic against KPm1 at 0.25x MIC and 0.5x MIC and ABm1 and PAm1 at 0.5x MIC. In contrast, none of the tested combinations demonstrated synergy against any colistin-susceptible P. aeruginosa isolates and clinical strains of K. pneumoniae isolates. Only colistin plus trimethoprim or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was synergistic and bactericidal at 0.5x MIC against K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603. Colistin resistance seems to promote the in vitro activity of unconventional colistin combinations. Additional experiments are warranted to understand the clinical significance of these observations.
TI  - Epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Gram-negative bacteria  causing urinary tract infections in the Asia-Pacific region: 2009-2010 results from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART).
AB  - In 2009, the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) was expanded to include surveillance of Gram-negative pathogens causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the Asia-Pacific region. A total of 1762 isolates were collected from 38 centers in 11 countries from patients with UTIs in 2009 and 2010. In vitro susceptibilities were determined by the broth microdilution method and susceptibility profiles were determined using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) interpretive criteria, as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) in 2010 (M100-S20), in 2011 (M100-S21), and in 2012 (M100-S22). Enterobacteriaceae comprised 86.0% of the isolates, of which Escherichia coli (56.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.8%) were the two most common species. Amikacin was the most effective antibiotic (91.7%), followed by ertapenem (86.9%), imipenem (86.6%), and piperacillin-tazobactam (84.9%). Rates of susceptibility were 50.3% for cefoxitin and ranged from 50.3% to 74.2% for the third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. For ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, the susceptibility rates were 51.4% and 54.4%, respectively. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae comprised 28.2% of all isolates. We also found a high rate of resistance to carbapenems among Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa causing UTI. Interestingly, according to 2012 CLSI breakpoints, approximately 33.4% of ESBL producers were still susceptible to ceftazidime. However, this in vitro efficacy of ceftazidime needs to be validated in vivo by clinical data. The lowered CLSI interpretive breakpoints for piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, and some cephalosporins in 2011-2012 for Enterobacteriaceae resulted in an approximate 5% drop in susceptibility rates for each drug, with the exception of imipenem for which the susceptibility rate dropped from 99.4% according to 2010 criteria to 91.2% according to 2011 criteria. With the updated CLSI criteria, the antimicrobial resistance threat from UTI pathogens in the Asia Pacific area was revealed to be more prominent.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections at five medical centers in Taiwan that continuously participated in the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) from 2006 to 2010.
AB  - The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) is a worldwide surveillance program designed to longitudinally monitor the in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents against pathogens that cause intra-abdominal infections (IAIs). In this study, trends in antimicrobial resistance during the period 2006 to 2010 were analyzed at five tertiary-care hospitals in Taiwan. Enterobacteriaceae accounted for the majority (80.9%) of the 2417 Gram-negative isolates, and the two most common species were Escherichia coli (38.8%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.5%). The rates of susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae isolates to cephalosporins decreased during the study period. Although carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam, and amikacin were active in vitro against more than 80% of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates, the activity of carbapenems declined during the study period. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in E. coli was steady, but that in K. pneumoniae decreased during the study period. The rate of ESBL-producing species was three-fold higher among patients with nosocomial IAIs than among patients with community-acquired IAIs. The majority of isolates from liver were K. pneumoniae (69%) and very few of those isolates were ESBL producers (0.9%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.3%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (3.8%) were the two most common non-Enterobacteriaceae. P. aeruginosa showed improved susceptibility, whereas A. baumannii showed a rapid development of resistance during the study period. There was marked geographic variation in resistance patterns of the isolates obtained during the study period. Northern Taiwan had the highest rate of ESBL producers and the highest rate of ceftazidime resistance among P. aeruginosa isolates. Central Taiwan had the lowest rate of ESBL producers but the highest rates of carbapenem resistance among P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates. Continuous monitoring and regular updates of epidemiological data are needed to guide appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of non-Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients with intra-abdominal infections in the Asia-Pacific region from 2003 to 2010: results from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART).
AB  - The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) is an international surveillance study designed to monitor resistance trends among aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from intra-abdominal infections. During 2003-2010, a total of 20710 GNB isolates were collected at medical centers in China, Hong Kong, Korea, New Zealand, and Taiwan. The susceptibility profiles of 2252 isolates of non-Enterobacteriaceae GNB were determined. At least 10 isolates of a given organism were required for that organism to be included in the analysis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the leading organism (49.2% of non-Enterobacteriaceae GNB), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (21.5%), Aeromonas spp. (11.6%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (9.1%). All the other species/genera made up less than 2%. The rates of susceptibility of the four major organisms were examined for two different time periods and according to whether the isolates had been obtained <48 h after hospitalization or >/= 48 h after hospital admission. P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas spp., and S. maltophilia showed sustained levels of susceptibility to several antimicrobial agents in the two time periods, whereas A. baumannii exhibited very high rates of resistance to most antimicrobial agents including imipenem. Nosocomial P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were more resistant than community-acquired pathogens, although this was not the case for Aeromonas spp. and S. maltophilia. Worldwide and regional surveillance is necessary to guide empirical antimicrobial therapy for infections due to non-Enterobacteriaceae GNB.
TI  - [The multiplex polymerase chain reaction for detection of ventilator-associated trachea-bronchitis and pneumonia in patients with common pathogens].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical utility of multiple polymerase chain reaction  (M-PCR) in the rapid detection of the common pathogens in ventilator-associated trachea - bronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: Sputum samples of 75 patients complicated VAT or VAP in surgical intensive care unit (SICU), were examined by bacterial culture, ordinary PCR, the M-PCR detection. The pathogen detection rates among three methods were compared. RESULTS: The Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae of the positive detection rates were 50.7%, 45.3%, 30.7%, 41.3% and 58.7% by bacterial culture. By ordinary PCR, the positive detection rates were respectively 88.0%, 89.3%, 78.7%, 85.3% and 93.3%, and by M-PCR, the positive detection rates were respectively 92.1%, 90.7%, 82.7%, 89.3% and 96.0%. The positive rates of five common pathogens of ordinary PCR and M-PCR were higher than those of bacterial culture (all P < 0.05). The M-PCR had merit for rapid detection compared with ordinary PCR. CONCLUSION: Compared with bacterial culture, ordinary PCR and M-PCR yield higher positive rates in identifying five common pathogens of VAT and VAP, meanwhile, it also demonstrated the tendency that M-PCR may save cost and labor power.
TI  - Changing bacteriology of abdominal and surgical sepsis.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review focuses on recent changes in epidemiological aspects of bacteria-induced intra-abdominal infections (IAIs), including the dominant pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, and emerging resistance phenotypes. RECENT FINDINGS: Enterobacteriaceae species, including Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, remain the major pathogens contributing to abdominal sepsis, although Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii have recently become common causes of hospital-acquired IAIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, especially those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), has increased worldwide, although the distribution of those organisms varies from region to region. Furthermore, recent changes in interpretive breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) have resulted in a marked increase in the reported rates of resistance among Gram-negative bacilli to carbapenems, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Besides, routine detection and reporting of ESBL phenotypes for clinical isolates have not been recommended after following new interpretive breakpoints. More studies are needed to investigate the impacts of these changes on therapeutic strategies and epidemiological surveillance. In addition, pathogens carrying New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases (NDMs), K. pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs), and other carbapenemases show extended resistance to currently available antibiotics and rapid transfer between species and countries. Although some of these pathogens are still susceptible to tigecycline and colistin, rates of resistance to these two agents are rising. SUMMARY: Abdominal sepsis due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, especially ESBL producers, and international and interspecies spreading of metallo-beta-lactamase raise key therapeutic problems.
TI  - Effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on antimicrobial susceptibilities for gram-negative rods.
AB  - Epidemiologic evidence suggests a beneficial effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in sepsis, and in-vitro data exist for antimicrobial activity of statins against some bacteria and fungi. We examined whether statin exposure at physiologic concentrations enhances activity of selected antimicrobials against Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Broth microdilution was performed with and without dose-ranging concentrations of lovastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin. No effects on antimicrobial activity were demonstrated.
TI  - Old agent, new experience: colistin use in the paediatric Intensive Care Unit--a  multicentre study.
AB  - Nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms are a common problem around the world, especially in Intensive Care Units. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of colistin therapy in paediatric patients with severe nosocomial infections caused by MDR Gram-negative bacteria. There were 87 episodes in 79 paediatric Intensive Care Unit patients in five different hospitals; each patient was treated intravenously with colistin and evaluated. Of the 79 patients, 54.4% were male and the median age was 30 months. The most commonly isolated microorganism was Acinetobacter baumannii, the most common isolation site was tracheal aspirate fluid and the most common type of infection was ventilator-associated pneumonia. The mean colistin dose in patients without renal failure was 5.4 +/- 0.6 mg/kg/day, the mean therapy duration was 17.2 +/- 8.4 days and the favourable outcome rate was 83.9%. Serious side effects were seen in four patient episodes (4.6%) during therapy; two patients suffered renal failure and the others had convulsive seizures. Other patients tolerated the drug well. The infection-related mortality rate was 11.5% and the probability of death within the first 9 days of treatment was 10 times higher than after the first 9 days. In conclusion, this study suggests that colistin is effective in the treatment of severe nosocomial infections caused by MDR Gram-negative bacteria and is generally well tolerated by patients, even after relatively long-term use.
TI  - In vitro characterization of multivalent adhesion molecule 7-based inhibition of  multidrug-resistant bacteria isolated from wounded military personnel.
AB  - Treatment of wounded military personnel at military medical centers is often complicated by colonization and infection of wounds with pathogenic bacteria. These include nosocomially transmitted, often multidrug-resistant pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We analyzed the efficacy of multivalent adhesion molecule (MAM) 7-based anti-adhesion treatment of host cells against aforementioned pathogens in a tissue culture infection model. Herein, we observed that a correlation between two important hallmarks of virulence, attachment and cytotoxicity, could serve as a useful predictor for the success of MAM7-based inhibition against bacterial infections. Initially, we characterized 20 patient isolates (five from each pathogen mentioned above) in terms of genotypic diversity, antimicrobial susceptibility and important hallmarks of pathogenicity (biofilm formation, attachment to and cytotoxicity toward cultured host cells). All isolates displayed a high degree of genotypic diversity, which was also reflected by large strain-to-strain variability in terms of biofilm formation, attachment and cytotoxicity within each group of pathogen. Using non-pathogenic bacteria expressing MAM7 or latex beads coated with recombinant MAM7 for anti-adhesion treatment, we showed a decrease in cytotoxicity, indicating that MAM7 has potential as a prophylactic agent to attenuate infection by multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of the antibacterial effect of and emergence of resistance to doripenem in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - An in vitro dilutional pharmacokinetic model of infection was used to study the pharmacodynamics of doripenem in terms of the ability to kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii and also changes in their population profiles. In dose-ranging studies, the cumulative percentages of a 24-h period that the drug concentration exceeds the MIC under steady-state pharmacokinetic conditions (T(MIC)s) required for doripenem to produce a 24-h bacteriostatic effect and a -2-log-unit reduction in viable count were 25% +/- 11% and 35% +/- 13%, respectively, for P. aeruginosa (MIC range, 0.24 to 3 mg/liter) and 20% +/- 11% and 33% +/- 12%, respectively, for Acinetobacter spp. (MIC range, 0.45 to 3.0 mg/liter). A T(MIC) of >40 to 50% produced a maximum response with both species at 24 h or 48 h of exposure. After 24 h of exposure to doripenem at a T(MIC) in the range of 12.5 to 37.5%, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii population profiles revealed mutants able to grow on 4x MIC-containing medium; such changes were further amplified by 48 h of exposure. Dose-fractionation experiments targeting T(MIC)s of 12.5%, 25%, or 37.5% as six exposures, two exposures, or a single exposure over 48 h with a single strain of P. aeruginosa indicated that changes in population profiles were greatest with multiple exposures at T(MIC) targets of 12.5 or 25%. In contrast, multiple exposures at 37.5% T(MIC) most effectively suppressed total bacterial counts and changes in population profiles. Simulations of human doses of doripenem of 500 mg, 1,000 mg, 2,000 mg, and 3,000 mg every 8 h over 96 h showed marked initial killing up to 6 h but growback thereafter. Changes in population profiles occurred only in the regimen of 500 mg every 8 h against P. aeruginosa but occurred with all dose regimens for A. baumannii strains. A doripenem T(MIC) of >/=40 to 50% is maximally effective in killing P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii and suppressing changes in population profiles in short-term experiments for up to 48 h; however, a T(MIC) of 12.5 to 25% amplifies population changes, especially with exposures every 8 h. In longer-term experiments, up to 96 h, even doripenem doses of 4 to 6 times those used in human studies proved incapable of pathogen eradication and prevention of changes in population profiles. The association of a T(MIC) of 25 to 37.5% with changes in population profiles has implications in terms of future clinical breakpoint setting.
TI  - Bacterial yield from quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with pneumonia on antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Early diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial choice are crucial when managing pneumonia patients, and quantitative culture of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is considered a useful method for identifying pneumonia pathogens. We evaluated the quantitative yield of BAL fluid bacterial cultures in patients being treated with antimicrobials and attempted to identify factors predictive of positive BAL cultures. METHODS: Patients over 18 years old and whose BAL fluid was subjected to quantitative culture to identify the organism causative of pneumonia between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009, were included. We reviewed the results of BAL fluid bacterial cultures and the clinical records, laboratory tests, and radiographic findings of the patients. RESULTS: BAL was performed on 340 patients with pneumonia. A positive BAL culture, defined as isolation of more than 10(4) colony forming units/mL bacteria, was documented in 18 (5.29%) patients. Of these, 9 bacteria isolated from 10 patients were classified as probable pathogens. The most frequently isolated bacteria were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No independent predictive factor for positive BAL cultures was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The yield of quantitative BAL fluid bacterial culture in patients already on antimicrobials was low. Clinicians should be cautious when performing a BAL culture in patients with pneumonia who are already on antimicrobials.
TI  - Costs of healthcare- and community-associated infections with antimicrobial-resistant versus antimicrobial-susceptible organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in Manhattan. The main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: Controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [CI], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; CI, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; CI, 1.5-5.4). Patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; CI, 0.01-0.08). CONCLUSIONS: With careful matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. The difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of colistin in cerebrospinal fluid after intraventricular administration of colistin methanesulfonate.
AB  - Intraventricular colistin, administered as colistin methanesulfonate (CMS), is the last resource for the treatment of central nervous system infections caused by panresistant Gram-negative bacteria. The doses and daily regimens vary considerably and are empirically chosen; the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pharmacokinetics of colistin after intraventricular administration of CMS has never been characterized. Nine patients (aged 18 to 73 years) were treated with intraventricular CMS (daily doses of 2.61 to 10.44 mg). Colistin concentrations were measured using a selective high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. The population pharmacokinetics analysis was performed with the P-Pharm program. The pharmacokinetics of colistin could be best described by the one-compartment model. The estimated values (means +/- standard deviations) of apparent CSF total clearance (CL/Fm, where Fm is the unknown fraction of CMS converted to colistin) and terminal half-life (t(1/2lambda)) were 0.033 +/- 0.014 liter/h and 7.8 +/- 3.2 h, respectively, and the average time to the peak concentration was 3.7 +/- 0.9 h. A positive correlation between CL/Fm and the amount of CSF drained (range 40 to 300 ml) was observed. When CMS was administered at doses of >/=5.22 mg/day, measured CSF concentrations of colistin were continuously above the MIC of 2 mug/ml, and measured values of trough concentration (C(trough)) ranged between 2.0 and 9.7 mug/ml. Microbiological cure was observed in 8/9 patients. Intraventricular administration of CMS at doses of >/=5.22 mg per day was appropriate in our patients, but since external CSF efflux is variable and can influence the clearance of colistin and its concentrations in CSF, the daily dose of 10 mg suggested by the Infectious Diseases Society of America may be more prudent.
TI  - OmpA is the principal nonspecific slow porin of Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Acinetobacter species show high levels of intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics. The major protein species in the outer membrane of Acinetobacter baumannii does not belong to the high-permeability trimeric porin family, which includes Escherichia coli OmpF/OmpC, and instead is a close homolog of E. coli OmpA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprF. We characterized the pore-forming function of this OmpA homolog, OmpA(Ab), by a reconstitution assay. OmpA(Ab) produced very low pore-forming activity, about 70-fold lower than that of OmpF and an activity similar to that of E. coli OmpA and P. aeruginosa OprF. The pore size of the OmpA(Ab) channel was similar to that of OprF, i.e., about 2 nm in diameter. The low permeability of OmpA(Ab) is not due to the inactivation of this protein during purification, because the permeability of the whole A. baumannii outer membrane was also very low. Furthermore, the outer membrane permeability to cephalothin and cephaloridine, measured in intact cells, was about 100-fold lower than that of E. coli K-12. The permeability of cephalothin and cephaloridine in A. baumannii was decreased 2- to 3-fold when the ompA(Ab) gene was deleted. These results show that OmpA(Ab) is the major nonspecific channel in A. baumannii. The low permeability of this porin, together with the presence of constitutive beta-lactamases and multidrug efflux pumps, such as AdeABC and AdeIJK, appears to be essential for the high levels of intrinsic resistance to a number of antibiotics.
TI  - Implications of endotracheal tube biofilm in ventilator-associated pneumonia response: a state of concept.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Biofilm in endotracheal tubes (ETT) of ventilated patients has been suggested to play a role in the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Our purpose was to analyze the formation of ETT biofilm and its implication in the response and relapse of VAP. METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study in a medical intensive care unit. Patients mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours were consecutively included. We obtained surveillance endotracheal aspirates (ETA) twice weekly and, at extubation, ETTs were processed for microbiological assessment and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of the patients were colonized based on ETA cultures. Biofilm was found in 95% of the ETTs. In 56% of the cases, the same microorganism grew in ETA and biofilm. In both samples the most frequent bacteria isolated were Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Nineteen percent of the patients developed VAP (N = 14), and etiology was predicted by ETA in 100% of the cases. Despite appropriate antibiotic treatment, bacteria involved in VAP were found in biofilm (50%). In this situation, microbial persistence and impaired response to treatment (treatment failure and relapse) were more frequent (100% vs 29%, P = 0.021; 57% vs 14%, P = 0.133). CONCLUSIONS: Airway bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on ETTs are early and frequent events in ventilated patients. There is microbiological continuity between airway colonization, biofilm formation and VAP development. Biofilm stands as a pathogenic mechanism for microbial persistence, and impaired response to treatment in VAP.
TI  - Total synthesis and biological evaluation of transvalencin Z.
AB  - The emerging global epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis has created an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic approaches for disease treatment. Transvalencin Z (1) is a natural product from Nocardia transvalensis with relatively potent and selective antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, making it an attractive target for structure-activity and mechanism of action studies. The total synthesis of the four possible diastereomers of transvalencin Z was completed (1a-d), and the absolute configurations were defined using chemical synthesis, HPLC retention times, and optical rotation measurements. Surprisingly, none of the transvalencin Z diastereomers exhibited any inhibitory activity against a panel of microbial pathogens, including several species of mycobacteria.
TI  - Analysis of the air/water channels of gastrointestinal endoscopies as a risk factor for the transmission of microorganisms among patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For the effective reprocessing of gastrointestinal endoscopes, contaminants must be removed from the entire surface. However, these devices have long and narrow channels that can make this process difficult. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the staff assigned to reprocess gastroscopes and colonoscopes in 37 services located throughout Brazil completed a questionnaire regarding reprocessing practices geared toward the channels in these devices. In addition, samples from these air/water channels were collected for microbiological analysis. RESULTS: Contamination was detected in 71.8% (28/39) of the samples obtained from the air/water channels of colonoscopes, and in 70% (42/60) of the samples from the air/water channels of gastroscopes. The median microbial load was 1,800 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in the colonoscopes and 750 CFU/mL in the gastroscopes. The main microorganisms isolated from the air/water channels of gastroscopes were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.4%), Escherichia coli (18.9%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (9.4%), and those isolated from the colonoscopes included P aeruginosa (46.4%), A baumannii (14.3%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.7%), among others. The possible causes of the contamination of these devices included the failure to fill these channels with cleaning solution, lack of friction during cleansing, and inadequate rinsing. CONCLUSION: The contamination of the air/water channels did in fact represent a risk for the transmission of microorganisms during gastrointestinal endoscopy exams, possibly related to the inadequate reprocessing of these channels.
TI  - Api88 is a novel antibacterial designer peptide to treat systemic infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - The emergence of multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens in hospitals (nosocomial infections) presents a global threat of growing importance, especially for Gram-negative bacteria with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or the novel New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) resistance. Starting from the antibacterial peptide apidaecin 1b, we have optimized the sequence to treat systemic infections with the most threatening human pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The lead compound Api88 enters bacteria without lytic effects at the membrane and inhibits chaperone DnaK at the substrate binding domain with a K(D) of 5 mumol/L. The Api88-DnaK crystal structure revealed that Api88 binds with a seven residue long sequence (PVYIPRP), in two different modes. Mice did not show any sign of toxicity when Api88 was injected four times intraperitoneally at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight (BW) within 24 h, whereas three injections of 1.25 mg/kg BW and 5 mg/kg BW were sufficient to rescue all animals in lethal sepsis models using pathogenic E. coli strains ATCC 25922 and Neumann, respectively. Radioactive labeling showed that Api88 enters all organs investigated including the brain and is cleared through both the liver and kidneys at similar rates. In conclusion, Api88 is a novel, highly promising, 18-residue peptide lead compound with favorable in vitro and in vivo properties including a promising safety margin.
TI  - [Aetiology of surgical infections in patients undergoing craniotomy].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative infections in patients undergoing craniotomy constitute significant complications associated with increased hospital stay and patient morbidity and mortality. Knowing the aetiology of surgical infections after craniotomy may contribute to improving antibiotic prophylaxis and empirical treatment. METHOD: Information relating to surgical infections in patients undergoing craniotomy was obtained from a series of annual surveys on prevalence of infections in Spanish hospitals (EPINE) during the period 1999-2006. The study protocol collected relevant clinical information on patients with infection. Presence of infection was determined according to the Centres for Disease Control infection criteria. RESULTS: During the time period considered, 107 cases of surgical infections in patients undergoing craniotomy were diagnosed. Forty patients were women (37%) and 67 were male (63%). The mean age was 51.7 years (median 55, range 6-86 years). The duration of the intervention was over 180minutes in 49 patients (45.8%).Thirty-eight patients (35.5%) underwent emergency surgery. Seventy-eight patients (73%) received surgical prophylaxis. Thirty-eight patients (35.5%) had superficial infection of the surgical wound, 38 patients (35.5%) had deep wound infection (including bone flap) and 31 patients (29%), postoperative infections of organ or space (meningitis, subdural empyema or brain abscess). The most common aetiology corresponded to staphylococci (50%), mainly S. aureus (one third of them methicillin-resistant), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%), Enterobacter spp (10%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (9%). CONCLUSION: Empirical treatment of these infections should include a glycopeptide such as vancomycin and a beta-lactam with coverage against non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against bacteria isolated from Thai patients with urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates of bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 1,255 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolated from different Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection in 2010 were included. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined by standard agar dilution method. RESULTS: The MIC50 and MIC90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sitafloxacin was active against 51% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. The activity of sitafloxacin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, such as, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumomiae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was comparable to or more than that of some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins or carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Sitafloxacin is more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against isolated bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract and lower respiratory infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, ESBL-producing Gram-negatives, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of fermented milk with Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota against common multidrug-resistant bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine inhibitory activity of fermented milk with Lactobacillus  casei strain Shirota (FMLC) against common multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Time-kill methods of FMLC and cell-free filtered fluid of FMLC (CF-FMLC) against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ESBL-producing Escherichia coli & Klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were conducted. The control solutions were Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) and distilled water. The mixtures of FMLC, CF-FMLC, MHB and DW with 10(5) to 10(6) CFU/ml of each bacterium were prepared and incubated at 35 degrees C. Each mixture was quantified for viable bacteria at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr after incubation onto brain heart infusion agar plates. The inoculated agar plates were incubated at 35 degrees C for 24-48 hr. Bacterial colonies on agar plates were counted and compared among the mixtures. RESULTS: Log CFUs of each organism in MHB and distilled water after incubation were increased from 5.1-6.3 at 0 h to 6.4- > 11 at 24 hr. Log CFUs of each organism in FMLC and CF-FMLC after incubation with study bacteria for 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr were decreased to undetectable amounts at 24 hr. CONCLUSION: FMLC and CF-FMLC exerted slow inhibitory activity against MDR bacteria resulting in eradication of all study bacteria at 24 hr. Such inhibitory effects were probably due to the products of the milk fermented by Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota. Clinical study is needed to determine if consumption of FMLC can prevent and treat colonization and infection with MDR bacteria in hospitalized patients.
TI  - [Changes of etiology of chronic sinusitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore etiology distribution changes of chronic naso sinusitis. METHOD: The purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 111 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi as experimental group. In the control group, the discharges of the nasal cavity from 30 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. The culture results were compared with data of 2005, and changes in the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms were analyzed. RESULT: Fifteen species, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, were cultured from the testing group. The total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. The detectable rates of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and various fungi were 37.8%, 54.4%, 7.8% respectively. Five species including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Branhamella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus etc were cultured from the control group. There was significant differences between 2005 and 2010 in experimental group (chi2 = 0.009, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection is a major reason for chronic sinusitis. The bacteria distribution structure changed from the original gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria. Fungal infections can not be ignored. To bacteria culture and drug sensitivity test should be done before antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Deciphering the function of the outer membrane protein OprD homologue of Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The increasing number of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates is a major cause for concern which restricts therapeutic options to treat severe infections caused by this emerging pathogen. To identify the molecular mechanisms involved in carbapenem resistance, we studied the contribution of an outer membrane protein homologue of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprD porin. Suspected to be the preferred pathway of carbapenems in A. baumannii, the oprD homologue gene was inactivated in strain ATCC 17978. Comparison of wild-type and mutant strains did not confirm the expected increased resistance to any antibiotic tested. OprD homologue sequence analysis revealed that this protein actually belongs to an OprD subgroup but is closer to the P. aeruginosa OprQ protein, with which it could share some functions, e.g., allowing bacterial survival under low-iron or -magnesium growth conditions or under poor oxygenation. We thus overexpressed and purified a recombinant OprD homologue protein to further examine its functional properties. As a specific channel, this porin presented rather low single-channel conductance, i.e., 28 pS in 1 M KCl, and was partially closed by micro- and millimolar concentrations of Fe(3+) and Mg(2+), respectively, but not by imipenem and meropenem or basic amino acids. The A. baumannii OprD homologue is likely not involved in the carbapenem resistance mechanism, but as an OprQ-like protein, it could contribute to the adaptation of this bacterium to magnesium- and/or iron-depleted environments.
TI  - Trends in aminoglycoside use and gentamicin-resistant gram-negative clinical isolates in US academic medical centers: implications for antimicrobial stewardship.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure trends in aminoglycoside antibiotic use and gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates across a network of hospitals and compare network-level relationships with those of individual hospitals. DESIGN: Longitudinal observational investigation. SETTING: US academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Adult inpatients. METHODS: Adult aminoglycoside use was measured from 2002 or 2003 through 2009 in 29 hospitals. Hospital-wide antibiograms assessed gentamicin resistance by proportions and incidence rates for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Mixed-effects analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of changes in aminoglycoside use and changes in resistance rates and proportions. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the relationship between aminoglycoside use and resistance. RESULTS: Mean aminoglycoside use declined by 41%, reflecting reduced gentamicin (P < .0001) and tobramycin (P < .005) use; amikacin use did not change. The rate and proportion of gentamicin-resistant P. aeruginosa decreased by 48% (P < .0001) and 31% (P < .0001), respectively. The rate and proportion of gentamicin-resistant E. coli increased by 166% and 124%, respectively (P < .0001), and they were related to increasing quinolone resistance in E. coli. Resistance among K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii did not change. Relationships between aminoglycoside use and resistance at the network level were highly variable at the individual hospital level. CONCLUSIONS: Mean aminoglycoside use declined in this network of US hospitals and was associated with significant and opposite changes in rates of resistance for some organisms and no change for others. At the individual hospital level, antibiograms appear to be an unreliable reflection of antibiotic use, at least for aminoglycosides.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of the hospital environment during wound dressing change.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The hospital environment plays a role in the cross-transmission of  multidrug-resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacterial contamination of the hospital environment during chronic wound dressing change. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was performed from July 2010 to May 2011. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae were counted in environmental samples (air and surfaces) that were obtained in the rooms of patients with wounds colonized (cases, n=9) or not (controls, n=15) during or not during wound dressing change. Bacterial contamination was compared to that found in the rooms of patients without colonized wounds. RESULTS: The environment was frequently contaminated during wound dressing change (38% of the sampled series were positive). In comparison, the contamination was less frequent in the environment of patients with colonized wounds when the wounds were not being dressed (14.3%) and in controls (3.8%). S. aureus was the most frequent species identified in positive samples. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that previously recommended measures such as hand hygiene after contact with the environment and wearing a mask are justified. Moreover, other measures should be suggested, in particular cleaning the room before and after dressing change of colonized wounds. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III: case control study.
TI  - Cation concentration variability of four distinct Mueller-Hinton agar brands influences polymyxin B susceptibility results.
AB  - Polymyxins have been the only alternative therapeutic option for the treatment of serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. For this reason, it is of crucial importance that susceptibility tests provide accurate results when testing these drug-pathogen combinations. In this study, the effect of cation concentration variability found on different commercial brands of Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) for testing polymyxin B susceptibility was evaluated. The polymyxin B susceptibilities determined using Etest and disk diffusion were compared to those determined by the CLSI reference broth microdilution method. In general, the polymyxin B MIC values were higher when determined by Etest than when determined by broth microdilution against both A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates. A high very major error rate (10%) was observed, as well as a trend toward lower MICs, compared to those determined by broth microdilution when the Merck MHA was tested by Etest. Poor essential agreement rates (10 to 70%) were observed for P. aeruginosa when all MHA brands were tested by Etest. Although an excellent categorical agreement rate (100%) was seen between the disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods for P. aeruginosa, larger zones of inhibition were shown obtained using the Merck MHA. The high cation concentration variability found for the MHA brands tested correlated to the low accuracy, and discrepancies in the polymyxin B MICs were determined by Etest method, particularly for P. aeruginosa isolates.
TI  - [The molecular mechanisms of resistance to B-lactams of pathogens of hospital-acquired infections].
AB  - The data of local microbiologic monitoring was used to study the profiles and mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics of gram-negative isolates of bacteria, pathogens of hospital-acquired infections in hospital reanimation and surgical departments. The study included 210 clinical isolates of pathogens of hospital-acquired infections: Pseudomonas aeruginosa--86 (40.9%), Acinetobacter baumannii--45 (21.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae--52 (24.8%), Escherichia coli-23 (11.0%), Enterobacter spp.--4 (1.9%). The profiles of resistance to antibiotics were analyzed using the technique of serial micro-dilutions. The detection of the most common and clinically significant gens of beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria was implemented using the PCR technique and sequence analysis. The most activity was detected among carbapenems and cephaperazone/sulbactam. The local characteristics of prevalence of gens coding beta-lactamases (TEM, SHV, CTX) in K. pneumoniae and E. coli were established The study detected 11 isolates of P aeruginosa resistant to carbapenems and having genetic determinants of VIM-group and coding metal-beta-lactamases. The discussed data permits to assess the indicators of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics and basic mechanisms of resistance of causative agents of hospital-acquired infections. The studies of this kind are unique for every type of hospital-acquired infection. The results can be used in the development of the concept of etiotropic and empiric therapy.
TI  - Modified Hodge test: A simple and effective test for detection of carbapenemase production.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Resistance among bacterial isolates is the leading cause of increased mortality and morbidity worldwide. Carbapenems once thought to be effective are becoming ineffective mostly due to the emergence of carbapenemase. This study was designed to determine in vitro efficacy of Modified Hodge test for detection of carbapenemase production in Gram negative rods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was done in the Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Rawalpindi Pakistan from January 2010 to December 2010. A total of 200 Gram negative rods from different clinical samples were taken. Those isolates which showed intermediate or susceptible zones i.e 16mm-21mm on disc diffusion were included in the study. These isolates were then subjected to Modified Hodge test. RESULT: Out of 200 isolates, 138 (69%) were positive for carbapenemase production by Modified Hodge test. Out of 138 MHT positive organisms, the frequency of E. coli was 38%, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17%), Acinetobacter baumannii (12%), Citrobacter diversus (2%) and Enterobacter agglomerans (1.4%). CONCLUSION: Modified Hodge test is a simple test which can be performed in the routine lab for detection of carbapenemases in isolates showing intermediate or sensitive zone diameter on disc diffusion.
TI  - The Design and Construction of K11: A Novel alpha-Helical Antimicrobial Peptide.
AB  - Amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides comprise a class of broad-spectrum agents that are used against pathogens. We designed a series of antimicrobial peptides, CP-P (KWKSFIKKLTSKFLHLAKKF) and its derivatives, and determined their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, their minimum hemolytic concentrations (MHCs) for human erythrocytes, and the Therapeutic Index (MHC/MIC ratio). We selected the derivative peptide K11, which had the highest therapeutic index (320) among the tested peptides, to determine the MICs against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and 22 clinical isolates including Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumonia. K11 exhibited low MICs (less than 10 mug/mL) and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, especially against clinically isolated drug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, these results indicate that K11 is a promising candidate antimicrobial peptide for further studies.
TI  - LiF Reduces MICs of Antibiotics against Clinical Isolates of Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (LiF) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphyloccoccus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with LiF were performed by microdilution method. MICs were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. We observed reduced MICs of antibiotics associated with LiF ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. The strongest decreases of MICs observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with LiF against Acinetobacter baumannii and Streptococcus pneumoniae. An eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against S. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against A. baumannii and S. pneumoniae. This suggests that LiF exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin in combination with colistin versus Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The treatment of Gram-negative infections is increasingly compromised by the spread of resistance. With few agents currently in development, clinicians are now considering the use of unorthodox combination therapies for multidrug-resistant strains. Here we assessed the in vitro activity of the novel lipoglycopeptide telavancin (TLV) when combined with colistin (COL) versus 13 Gram-negative type strains and 66 clinical isolates. Marked synergy was observed in either checkerboard (fractional inhibitory concentration index [FICI], <0.5; susceptibility breakpoint index [SBPI], >2) or time-kill assays (>2-log reduction in viable counts compared with starting inocula at 24 h) versus the majority of COL-susceptible enterobacteria, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, but only limited effects were seen against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or strains with COL resistance. Using an Etest/agar dilution method, the activity of TLV was potentiated by relatively low concentrations of COL (0.25 to 0.75 mug/ml), reducing the MIC of TLV from >32 mug/ml to </= 1 mug/ml for 35% of the clinical isolates. This provides further evidence that glycopeptide-polymyxin combinations may be a useful therapeutic option in the treatment of Gram-negative infections.
TI  - The impact of the types of microorganisms isolated from blood and wounds on the results of treatment in burn patients with sepsis.
AB  - Despite development of combustiology, infections continue to be the most important cause of death among patients with burns. Sepsis is the most severe clinical presentation of infection in patients after thermal injuries who require immediate treatment. Early diagnosis and proper treatment of sepsis are important in the clinical management that is often hampered for multiple reasons, e.g. impaired patient immunity, problems with microorganisms with multi-antibacterial drug resistance. The aim of the study was to assess effect of type of a microorganism isolated from blood and wound on results of treatment of sepsis in patients with burns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Effect of type of microorganisms isolated from blood and wound on the result of treatment of sepsis was studied in 338 patients hospitalized immediately after an injury in Centre for Burn Treatment in Siemianowice Slaskie in years 2003 - 2004 (at the age of 18 - 96 years, 66 women and 272 men). Clinical symptoms of generalized infection were found in all study subjects. The study group was divided into two subgroups: cured patients and patients who died of sepsis. The following parameters were assessed in both subgroups: type of microorganism isolated from blood, type of microorganism isolated from wound as well as occurrence of the same and different infections of blood and burn wound. RESULTS: positive blood cultures were found in 165 patients (48.8%), 106 (64.2%) were cured, 59 (35.8%) died. The most commonly isolated microorganisms in cured patients were Gram(+) Staphylococcus epidermidis MRSE (19.81%) and Staphylococcus aureus MRSA (18.87%). Gram(-) intestinal rods were least commonly isolated from this group. The most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood of patients who were to die, included non-fermenting Gram(-) rods Acinetobacter baumannii (35.59%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.03%). Mixed bacterial flora was found in the blood of 22.03% patients. Among patients who were to die, the same microorganisms were found in the blood and in the wound in 32.2% of patients, while this rate was 17.92 in cured patients. The most commonly found bacteria in the blood and burn wound in the cured patients included Staphylococcus aureus MRSA (31.58%) and Staphylococcus aureus (21.05%). In the group of patients who were to die, the most common bacteria isolated simultaneously from the blood and burn wound included Acinetobacter baumannii (47.37%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36.84%). CONCLUSIONS: 1. The patients with thermal injuries are at higher risk of death in the event of sepsis caused by Gram(-) bacteria versus Gram(+) bacteria. 2. Infection of blood and burn wound caused by the same bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanni increases the risk of death due to sepsis in patients with burns following thermal injuries.
TI  - Persistence of nosocomial pathogens on various fabrics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fabrics can become contaminated with high numbers of microorganisms that may be pathogenic to patients in a hospital setting and can play an important role in the chain of infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the survival of several clinical bacterial and fungal isolates on several fabrics commonly used in hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial and fungal survival was tested on the following materials, each of which are commonly used in our hospital: 100% smooth cotton, 60% cotton-40% polyester, 100% wool and 100% silk. One isolate each of Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Geotrichum candidum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive Escherichia coli, inducible beta-lactamase (IBL) positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa, IBL-positive Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were used to contaminate fabrics. The survival of these microorganisms was studied by testing the fabric swatches for microbial growth. RESULTS: The median survival times for all the tested bacteria and fungi were as follows: 26 days on cotton, 26.5 days on cotton-polyester, 28 days on silk, and 30 days on wool. Among the bacterial species tested, E. faecium had the longest survival time on cotton-polyester fabrics. For the fungal isolates, it was observed that C. tropicalis and C. krusei survived for the shortest amount of time on cotton fabrics in the present study. CONCLUSION: This survival data indicate that pathogenic microorganisms can survive from days to months on commonly used hospital fabrics. These findings indicate that current recommendations for the proper disinfection or sterilization of fabrics used in hospitals should be followed to minimize cross-contamination and prevent nosocomial infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (non-fermenters) can cause serious healthcare-associated infections and are often resistant to multiple antibiotics. We examined resistance rates among these bacteria from different regions of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study between January and December 2009 examined 8908 clinical non-fermenters from 24 hospitals across Saudi Arabia. Susceptibility testing was monitored to ensure compliance with CLSI guidelines, but the antibiotics tested were at the hospitals' discretion. RESULTS: Out of the 8908 non-fermenters, most were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (72.9%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (25.3%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.8%). Resistance rates among P. aeruginosa were: polymyxin B, 2.2%; imipenem, 15.9%; ciprofloxacin, 22.0%; amikacin, 22.9%; and gentamicin, 31.2%. Resistance rates among A. baumannii were: imipenem, 5.4%; polymyxin B, 13.2%; ciprofloxacin, 64.0%; trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 73.8%; amikacin, 76.9%; and gentamicin, 77.8%. Resistance rates among S. maltophilia were: polymyxin B, 6.9%; trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 20.5%; and ciprofloxacin, 38.9%. There was major variation in resistance rates between geographical regions. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance rates among non-fermenters were high in Saudi Arabia and were variable among regions.
TI  - A comparative study of the bactericidal activity and daily disinfection housekeeping surfaces by a new portable pulsed UV radiation device.
AB  - Daily cleaning and disinfecting of non-critical surfaces in the patient-care areas are known to reduce the occurrence of health care-associated infections. However, the conventional means for decontamination of housekeeping surfaces of sites of frequent hand contact such as manual disinfection using ethanol wipes are laborious and time-consuming in daily practice. This study evaluated a newly developed portable pulsed ultraviolet (UV) radiation device for its bactericidal activity in comparison with continuous UV-C, and investigated its effect on the labor burden when implemented in a hospital ward. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin-resistant A. baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Bacillus cereus were irradiated with pulsed UV or continuous UV-C. Pulsed UV and continuous UV-C required 5 and 30 s of irradiation, respectively, to attain bactericidal activity with more than 2Log growth inhibition of all the species. The use of pulsed UV in daily disinfection of housekeeping surfaces reduced the working hours by half in comparison to manual disinfection using ethanol wipes. The new portable pulsed UV radiation device was proven to have a bactericidal activity against critical nosocomial bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria after short irradiation, and was thus found to be practical as a method for disinfecting housekeeping surfaces and decreasing the labor burden.
TI  - The use of multiplex real-time PCR improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. Knowledge of pathogens causing CAP constitutes the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. Previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time PCR as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of CAP (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila) in CAP patients attending Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan (HTAA)/ Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia. Two previously developed multiplex real-time PCR assays, duplex for the differential detection of S. pneumoniae and B. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of CAP in blood and respiratory samples. Thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult CAP patients admitted to HTAA were analysed by multiplex real-time PCR assays and conventional methods. The microbial etiology of CAP could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of CAP patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time PCR. The most frequently detected pathogens were S. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by PCR alone), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), B. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by PCR alone and 17% by both culture and PCR), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), M. pneumoniae (6.5% - all by serology), C. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both PCR and serology), L. pneumophila (2.1% - all by PCR alone), Escherichia coli (4.3%). Haemophilus infuenzae, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).
TI  - Application of ventilator care bundle and its impact on ventilator associated pneumonia incidence rate in the adult intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To reduce ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence rate, lessen the cost of care, and correlate VAP bundles compliance with VAP incidence rate. METHODS: This study was a prospective longitudinal study conducted on adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients at Hera General Hospital, Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from January to December 2010. The following Institute for Healthcare Improvement VAP prevention bundle was applied: head-of-bed elevation; daily sedation-vacation along with a readiness-to-wean assessment; peptic ulcer disease (PUD) prophylaxis; and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. RESULTS: Among a total of 2747 patients, the bundle compliance rate in January 2010 was 30%, and reached to 100% in December 2010, while the overall rate was 78.9%. The individual bundle compliance rates were as follows: head-of-bed elevation - 99.9%; daily sedation vacation - 88.9%; PUD prophylaxis - 94.9%; and DVT prophylaxis - 85.7%. At the beginning, VAP rate was 2.5/1000 ventilator days, and reduced to 0.54 in the next month. The overall VAP incidence rate in 2010 was found to be 1.98 with a reduction of 1.41 by comparing with the same data of year 2009 collected retrospectively. The total reduction cost in one year was $154,930. A significant correlation was found between the VAP rate and its bundle compliance (p=0.001). Most frequent pathogens found were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.8% of all isolates) followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (27.7%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (15.4%). CONCLUSION: Application of VAP prevention bundle reduced the VAP incidence rate and lowered the cost of care.
TI  - High-dose, extended-interval colistin administration in critically ill patients:  is this the right dosing strategy? A preliminary study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-negative bacteria susceptible only to colistin (COS) are emerging causes of severe nosocomial infections, reviving interest in the use of colistin. However, consensus on the most effective way to administer colistin has not yet been reached. METHODS: All patients who had sepsis due to COS gram-negative bacteria or minimally susceptible gram-negative bacteria and received intravenous colistimethate sodium (CMS) were prospectively enrolled. The CMS dosing schedule was based on a loading dose of 9 MU and a 9-MU twice-daily fractioned maintenance dose, titrated on renal function. For each CMS course, clinical cure, bacteriological clearance, daily serum creatinine clearance, and estimated creatinine clearance were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-eight infectious episodes due to Acinetobacter baumannii (46.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (46.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.2%) were analyzed. The main types of infection were bloodstream infection (64.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (35.7%). Clinical cure was observed in 23 cases (82.1%). Acute kidney injury developed during 5 treatment courses (17.8%), did not require renal replacement therapy, and subsided within 10 days from CMS discontinuation. No correlation was found between variation in serum creatinine level (from baseline to peak) and daily and cumulative doses of CMS, and between variation in serum creatinine level (from baseline to peak) and duration of CMS treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that in severe infections due to COS gram-negative bacteria, the high-dose, extended-interval CMS regimen has a high efficacy, without significant renal toxicity.
TI  - Decreased resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with restriction of ciprofloxacin  in a large teaching hospital's intensive care and intermediate care units.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of restricting ciprofloxacin on the resistance of nosocomial gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to antipseudomonal carbapenems. DESIGN: Interrupted time-series analysis. SETTING: Tertiary care teaching hospital with 11 intensive care and intermediate care units with a total of 295 beds. PATIENTS: All nosocomial isolates of P. aeruginosa. INTERVENTION: Restriction of ciprofloxacin. RESULTS: There was a significant decreasing trend observed in the percentage (P = .0351) and the rate (P = .0006) of isolates of P. aeruginosa that were resistant to antipseudomonal carbapenems following the restriction of ciprofloxacin. There was also a significant decreasing trend observed in the percentage (P = .0017) and the rate (P = .0001) of isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa. The rate of cefepime-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates declined (P = .004) but the percentage of cefepime-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates did not change. There were no significant changes observed in the rate or the percentage of piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates. There were no significant changes observed in the susceptibilities of nosocomial Enterobacteriaciae or Acinetobacter baumannii isolates that were resistant to carbapenems. Over the study period there was a significant increase in the use of carbapenems (P = .0134); the use of ciprofloxacin decreased significantly (P = .0027). There were no significant changes in the use of piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime. CONCLUSION: Restriction of ciprofloxacin was associated with a decreased resistance of P. aeruginosa isolates to antipseudomonal carbapenems and ciprofloxacin in our hospital's intermediate care and intensive care units. There were no changes observed in the susceptibilities of nosocomial Enterobacteriaciae or A. baumannii to carbapenems, despite increased carbapenem use. Reducing ciprofloxacin use may be a means of controlling multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Device-associated nosocomial infection rates in intensive care units at Cairo University hospitals: first step toward initiating surveillance programs in a resource-limited country.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Device associated infections (DAIs) have major impact on patient morbidity and mortality. METHODS: This study involved active prospective surveillance to measure the incidence of DAIs, evaluate microbiological profiles, and investigate excessive mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) in 3 hospitals of Cairo University applying the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network case definitions for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Data were collected between March 2009 and May 2010. RESULTS: A total of 1,101 patients were hospitalized for a total of 10,869 days, had 4,734 device-days, and acquired 97 DAIs, with an overall rate of 20.5/1,000 ICU days. VAP was the most commonly identified infection (88.7%); followed by CLABSI (8.2%) and CAUTI (3.1%). Excess mortality was 48% (relative risk, 1.9; P < .001) for CAUTI, 12.9% (relative risk, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.4; P < .05) for VAP, and 45.7% for CLABSI. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most frequently isolated pathogen (36.1%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (29.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%). High antimicrobial resistance was identified, with 85% of A baumannii isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin and imipenem, 76% of K pneumoniae isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and 56.3% P aeruginosa isolates resistant to imipenem (56.3%). CONCLUSION: High rates of DAI and antimicrobial resistance require strengthening infection control, instituting surveillance systems, and implementing evidence-based preventive strategies.
TI  - Biofilms on environmental surfaces: evaluation of the disinfection efficacy of a  novel steam vapor system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental surfaces in health care settings are often contaminated by microorganisms, and biofilms can develop on the surfaces in these settings. Steam vapor technology is of potential use for disinfection of biofilms on the environmental surfaces. METHODS: We tested the disinfection efficacy of a thermal-accelerated nanocrystal sanitation (TANCS)-equipped steam vapor technology against biofilms through disinfecting biofilms developed by 4 bacterial strains-Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus-on an identical test surface (ie, polycarbonate) and biofilms developed by E coli on 4 different test surfaces: polycarbonate, rubber, stainless steel, and ceramics. RESULTS: Our data show that a 3-second steam treatment rapidly killed each biofilm tested (>99.95 % killing efficiency). For biofilms developed on different surfaces, 3-second steam treatment achieved 99.95% killing of E coli biofilms developed on different surfaces. Compared with chemical disinfection, steam treatment for <1 second a similar level of biofilm disinfection as provided by incubation with 10-ppm sodium hypochlorite (bleach) for 10-20 minutes of contact time. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the TANCS-equipped steam vapor disinfection is an emerging and potentially useful technology for disinfecting biofilms on environmental surfaces.
TI  - Genetic support and diversity of acquired extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Gram-negative rods.
AB  - Genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have been reported in a  variety of Gram-negative species, mostly in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. They are either TEM- or SHV-derivatives, CTX-M-like enzymes and less frequently of the GES, PER, or VEB types. The mechanisms at the origin of their acquisition are diverse, and mostly are related to insertion sequences, transposons and class 1 integrons. This diversity of genetic vehicles at the origin of these mobilization/acquisition processes may explain spread of ESBLs worldwide.
TI  - [Development status of new antibacterials].
AB  - The increase of the infections caused by multi-drug-resistant bacteria is a serious problem worldwide. As for Gram-positive bacteria, the community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin- or linezolid-resistant strains have been increasing. As for Gram-negative bacteria, multi-drug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii have been increasing due to the carbapenemase production recently. During these 10 years, various types of novel antibacterials targeted for Gram-positive bacteria have been approved in US and EU, but not in Japan. On the other hand, the discovery of new antibacterials targeted for Gram-negative bacteria is still immature. In this review, the status of the discovery of new antibacterials targeted for these multi-drug-resistant bacteria will be reviewed.
TI  - [Clinical and social problems in controlling multidrug-resistant organisms].
AB  - There have been limited evidence for controlling multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli, since multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-Ab) have emerged. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published the first guideline entitled 'Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms in Healthcare Settings, 2006'. Following that, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) has also published a guidance entitled 'Guide to the Elimination of Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Transmission in Healthcare Settings' in 2010. The Japanese Society for Environmental Infections (JSEI) has launched soon after the largest MDR-Ab outbreak was reported, and then published the position statement on controlling multidrug-resistant organisms. The aim of this statement is to provide a clear direction of controlling multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli to Japanese healthcare facilities, when planning a grand design of infection control in each setting. In this report, critical points and matters need to be discussed were assessed.
TI  - Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in Canada 2009-10: results from the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the occurrence and molecular mechanisms associated with carbapenemases in carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative isolates from Canadian cases. METHODS: Twenty hospital sites across Canada submitted isolates for a 1 year period starting 1 September 2009. All Enterobacteriaceae with MICs >/= 2 mg/L and Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MICs >/= 16 mg/L of carbapenems were submitted to the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) where carbapenem MICs were confirmed by Etest and isolates were characterized by PCR for carbapenemase genes, antimicrobial susceptibilities, PFGE and plasmid isolation. RESULTS: A total of 444 isolates (298 P. aeruginosa, 134 Enterobacteriaceae and 12 A. baumannii) were submitted to the NML of which 274 (61.7%; 206 P. aeruginosa, 59 Enterobacteriaceae and 9 A. baumannii) met the inclusion criteria as determined by Etest. Carbapenemase genes were identified in 30 isolates: bla(GES-5) (n = 3; P. aeruginosa), bla(KPC-3) (n = 7; Enterobacteriaceae), bla(NDM-1) (n = 2; Enterobacteriaceae), bla(VIM-2) and bla(VIM-4) (n = 8; P. aeruginosa) bla(SME-2) (n = 1; Enterobacteriaceae) and bla(OXA-23) (n = m9; A. baumannii). PFGE identified a cluster in each of Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii corresponding to isolates harbouring carbapenemase genes. Three KPC plasmid patterns (IncN and FllA) were identified where indistinguishable plasmid patterns were identified in unrelated clinical isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenemases were rare at the time of this study. Dissemination of carbapenemases was due to both dominant clones and common plasmid backbones.
TI  - Epidemiology of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis and vantilator-associated pneumonia in patients with inhalation injury at the Burn Centre in Brno (Czech Republic).
AB  - Aim. The aim of this work is to determine the incidence of ventilator-associated  tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and to define the define the most important respiratory pathogens in patients with inhalation injury. Introduction. Infectious complications in severely burned patients present serious problems. Patients with inhalation injuries are exposed to greater risk owing to the possible development of infectious complications in the lower respiratory tract. VAP is the predominant cause of death in these patients. This is due to the increasing resistance of strains of Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Design. Retrospective, monocentric. Setting. A five-bed burn intensive care unit. Material and methods. Between 2004 and 2009, 348 adult patients were hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Department of Burns and Reconstructive Surgery, Brno University Hospital, Czech Republic. Of these, 127 (36.49%) were diagnosed by bronchoscopy as having inhalation injury. The prerequisite for inclusion in the cohort was an inhalation injury requiring artificial ventilation for at least 48 h. The lower airway microbiological condition was monitored regularly by sampling biological material for cultures (sputum, tracheobronchial aspirates, etc.). For the diagnosis of VAP and VAT we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score. Results. The average age of the 127 patients (31 women/96 men) included in the study was 38.4 yr (range, 21-69 yr) and the average total body surface area (TBSA) burned was 29.3% (range, 2-75%). The average length of hospital stay was 49.4 days (range, 4-150 days) and the duration of mechanical ventilation 8.7 days; 18 patients (14.2%) died. In patients with inhalation injury, 309 strains of bacteria were cultivated from the lower respiratory tract, of which 234 were Gram-negative. All of these bacterial strains were isolated in significant quantities for lower respiratory tract infection. The most common bacteria isolated from the lower respiratory tract was Klebsiella pneumoniae (78 times), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (49x), and Acinetobacter baumannii (28x). VAT was diagnosed in 109 patients (85.8%) in the cohort. The incidence of VAT was calculated to be 98.8 per 1000 days of mechanical ventilation. VAP was diagnosed in 34 patients in the cohort (26.8%). The incidence of VAP was calculated as being 30.8 cases per 1,000 days of mechanical ventilation. In eight patients (23.5%), VAP was diagnosed within 5 days of initiation of mechanical ventilation (early onset) and in 26 patients (76.5%) after a longer period (late onset). The most common aetiological agent of VAT and VAP was Klebsiella pneumoniae (respectively 41.3% and 35.3%). Conclusion. In this study we were able to determine the incidence of VAP and VAT in patients with inhalation injury. In spite of the advances in diagnostics and therapy, inhalation injury is still burdened with disappointingly high morbidity and mortality rates. For this reason, the treatment of VAP remains a major challenge for all physicians caring for patients with inhalation injury.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of carbapenems against major Gram-negative pathogens: results of Asia-Pacific surveillance from the COMPACT II study.
AB  - Resistance rates amongst Gram-negative pathogens are increasing in the Asia-Pacific region. The Comparative Activity of Carbapenem Testing (COMPACT) II study surveyed the carbapenem susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of doripenem, imipenem and meropenem against 1260 major Gram-negative pathogens isolated from hospitalised patients at 20 centres in five Asia-Pacific countries (New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) during 2010. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=625), Enterobacteriaceae (n=500), and other Gram-negative pathogens including Acinetobacter baumannii (n=135) were collected from patients with bloodstream infection (32.2%), nosocomial pneumonia including ventilator-associated pneumonia (58.1%), and complicated intra-abdominal infection (9.7%), with 36.7% being isolated from patients in an Intensive Care Unit. As high as 29.8% of P. aeruginosa and 73.0% of A. baumannii isolates were not susceptible to at least a carbapenem, whereas the majority of Enterobacteriaceae (97.2%) were susceptible to all carbapenems. Respective MIC(50)/MIC(90) values (MICs for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) of doripenem, imipenem and meropenem were: 0.38/8, 1.5/32 and 0.38/16 mg/L for P. aeruginosa; 0.023/0.094, 0.25/0.5 and 0.032/0.094 mg/L for Enterobacteriaceae; and 32/64, 32/128 and 32/64 mg/L for A. baumannii. Doripenem and meropenem had comparable activity against P. aeruginosa, both being more active than imipenem. All carbapenems were highly potent against Enterobacteriaceae, although imipenem demonstrated higher MIC values than doripenem and meropenem. The three carbapenems showed less activity against A. baumannii. The high prevalence of carbapenem resistance amongst important nosocomial pathogens (P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii) warrants rigorous infection control measures and appropriate antimicrobial use in the Asia-Pacific region.
TI  - Transmission of carbapenem-resistant pathogens in New York City hospitals: progress and frustration.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are endemic in many medical centres. Because therapeutic options are limited, understanding the epidemiology and controlling the spread of these pathogens are of paramount importance. METHODS: Isolates of K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were collected from 14 hospitals in New York City over a 3 month period in 2009, and analysed for the presence of genes encoding important carbapenemases. Comparisons were made with a similar study conducted in 2006. Demographic and infection control-related information from hospitals was collected. RESULTS: Overall, 29% of K. pneumoniae possessed the carbapenemase KPC, significantly improved from the 38% observed in 2006 (P < 0.001). However, carbapenem resistance worsened in A. baumannii (mostly due to the emergence of strains with OXA-type carbapenemases) and P. aeruginosa. The decline in KPC-possessing K. pneumoniae was not uniformly observed in all of the hospitals. In a subset analysis of nine hospitals, those with a decreasing prevalence of bla(KPC) had shorter average lengths of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Measurable improvement has occurred in reducing the spread of KPC-possessing K. pneumoniae, and reducing the average length of stay may augment infection control efforts. However, the problem of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa lingers. New approaches, including respiratory isolation and environmental cleaning, need to be examined to control the spread of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by ESKAPE organisms: cause, clinical features, and management.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite important geographical variations, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) episodes. Their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on ICU patients' outcome. This review updates information on VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens. RECENT FINDINGS: Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus VAP may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. Local colonization determines treatment options. The contribution of tracheobronchitis is an important issue. Minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria VAP to prescribe extended infusion beta-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. Strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by ESKAPE pathogens. SUMMARY: VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity.
TI  - Porphyrin-cellulose nanocrystals: a photobactericidal material that exhibits broad spectrum antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Towards our overall objectives of developing potent antimicrobial materials to combat the escalating threat to human health posed by the transmission of surface-adhering pathogenic bacteria, we have investigated the photobactericidal activity of cellulose nanocrystals that have been modified with a porphyrin-derived photosensitizer (PS). The ability of these previously synthesized porphyrin-cellulose-nanocrystals (CNC-Por (1)) to mediate bacterial photodynamic inactivation was investigated as a function of bacterial strain, incubation time and illumination time. Despite forming an insoluble suspension, CNC-Por (1) showed excellent efficacy toward the photodynamic inactivation of Acinetobacter baumannii, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with the best results achieving 5-6 log units reduction in colony forming units (CFUs) upon illumination with visible light (400-700 nm; 118 J cm(-2)). CNC-Por (1) mediated the inactivation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although at reduced activity (2-3 log units reduction). Confocal laser scanning microscopy of CNC-Por (1) after incubation with A. baumannii or S. aureus suggested a lack of internalization of the PS. Research into alternative materials such as CNC-Por (1) may lead to their application in hospitals and healthcare-related industries wherein novel materials with the capability of reducing the rates of transmission of a wide range of bacteria, particularly antibiotic resistant strains, are desired.
TI  - Ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin restriction in an intensive care unit: less incidence of Acinetobacter spp. and improved susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether restricting the use of ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin could significantly reduce colonization and infection with resistant Gram-negative bacilli (r-GNB). METHODS: A two-phase prospective study (before/after design) was conducted in an intensive care unit in two time periods (2004-2006). During phase 1, there was no antibiotic restriction. During phase 2, use of ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin was restricted. RESULTS: Atotal of 200 patients were prospectively evaluated. In phase 2, the use of ceftriaxone was reduced by 93.6% (P = 0.0001) and that of ciprofloxacin by 65.1% (P = 0.041), accompanied by a 113.8% increase in use of ampicillin-sulbactam (P = 0.002).During phase 1, 48 GNB were isolated [37 r-GNB (77.1%) and 11 non-r-GNB (22.9%)], compared with a total of 64 during phase 2 [27 r-GNB (42.2%) and 37 non-r-GNB (57.8%)](P = 0.0002). Acinetobacter spp. was isolated 13 times during phase 1 and 3 times in phase 2 (P = 0.0018). The susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin increased from 40.0% in phase 1 to 100.0% in phase 2 (P = 0.0108). CONCLUSIONS: Restriction of ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin reduced colonization by Acinetobacter spp. and improved the susceptibility profile of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Gram-negative osteomyelitis: clinical and microbiological profile.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the growing interest in the study of Gram-negative bacilli  (GNB) infections, very little information on osteomyelitis caused by GNB is available in the medical literature. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: To assess clinical and microbiological features of 101 cases of osteomyelitis caused by GNB alone, between January 2007 and January 2009, in a reference center for the treatment of high complexity traumas in the city of Sao Paulo. RESULTS: Most patients were men (63%), with median age of 42 years, affected by chronic osteomyelitis (43%) or acute osteomyelitis associated to open fractures (32%), the majority on the lower limbs (71%). The patients were treated with antibiotics as inpatients for 40 days (median) and for 99 days (median) in outpatient settings. After 6 months follow-up, the clinical remission rate was around 60%, relapse 19%, amputation 7%, and death 5%. Nine percent of cases were lost to follow-up. A total of 121 GNB was isolated from 101 clinical samples. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Enterobacter sp. (25%), Acinetobacter baumannii (21%) e Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). Susceptibility to carbapenems was about 100% for Enterobacter sp., 75% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 60% for Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: Osteomyelitis caused by GNB remains a serious therapeutic challenge, especially when associated to nonfermenting bacteria. We emphasize the need to consider these agents in diagnosed cases of osteomyelitis, so that an ideal antimicrobial treatment can be administered since the very beginning of the therapy.
TI  - Use of adjunctive aerosolized antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adjunctive aerosolized antibiotics (AAA) have been recommended in the setting of Gram-negative ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but little is known about their influence on clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes associated with AAA for the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) VAP. METHODS: A retrospective, single-center cohort study at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St Louis, Missouri. Consecutive subjects treated for bronchoalveolar lavage-confirmed PA or AB VAP between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2009 were enrolled. Records of subjects treated with AAA were compared to those who did not receive AAAs (NAAA). RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were evaluated (NAAA n = 74, AAA n = 19, inhaled colistin n = 9, inhaled tobramycin n = 10). Patients receiving AAA were significantly more likely to be infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria (52.6% vs 14.9%, P < .001) and had greater Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (21.4 +/- 5.7 vs 17.5 +/- 5.3, P = .004) compared to patients receiving NAAA. NAAA subjects experienced a shorter time from VAP onset to appropriate intravenous antibiotic initiation (0.5 +/- 0.9 d vs 2.6 +/- 5.4 d, P = .038), but length of intravenous therapy was similar between groups (12.8 +/- 8.5 d vs 17.8 +/- 13.3 d, P = .16). The NAAA group demonstrated significantly shorter mechanical ventilation duration (18.9 +/- 15.9 d vs 38.4 +/- 32.4 days, P < .001), intensive care unit stay (37.5 +/- 42.5 d vs 56.3 +/- 31.3 d, P = .001), and hospital stay (39.0 +/- 42.5 d vs 58.3 +/- 33.4 d, P = .001). However, Kaplan-Meier curves for the probability of 30-day survival from VAP onset demonstrated that patients receiving AAA had statistically greater survival (P = .030 by the log rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PA and AB VAP may experience favorable survival when treated with AAA, despite greater severity of illness and a greater incidence of multidrug-resistant infection. Large randomized trials are needed to further explore this therapy.
TI  - Comparative activity of carbapenem testing (the COMPACT study) in Turkey.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent evidence indicates that Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, the most common of which are Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae, and Acinetobacter baumannii, are frequent causes of hospital-acquired infections. This study aims to evaluate the in vitro activity of doripenem and comparator carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative clinical isolates collected from COMParative Activity of Carbapenem Testing (COMPACT) study centres in Turkey. METHODS: Ten centres in Turkey were invited to submit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, and other Gram-negative isolates from intensive care unit (ICU)/non-ICU patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections, bloodstream infections, or nosocomial pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, between May and October 2008. Susceptibility was determined by each centre using E-test. A central laboratory performed species confirmation as well as limited susceptibility and quality-control testing. RESULTS: Five hundred and ninety six isolates were collected. MIC90 values for doripenem, meropenem, and imipenem, respectively, were 32, >/= 64, and >/= 64 mg/L against Pseudomonas spp.; 0.12, 0.12, and 0.5 mg/L against Enterobacteriaceae; and >/= 64 mg/L for each against other Gram-negative isolates. In determining the susceptibility of hospital isolates of selected Gram-negative pathogens to doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem, we found that against all pathogens combined, the MIC90 for ICU compared with non-ICU isolates was higher. CONCLUSIONS: Doripenem showed similar or slightly better activity than meropenem and better activity than imipenem against the Gram-negative pathogens collected in Turkey.
TI  - [Investigation and analysis of nosocomial infection in neonates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of nosocomial infections of newborn infants in neonates and to explore the risk factors and strategies of infection control. METHODS: There were 433 confirmed cases of nosocomial infection in the neonatal ward of the authors' hospital from January 2007 to December 2009. Their data of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, results of etiological examinations and antibiotic resistance were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: During the study, the number of hospitalizations were 6437. Nosocomial infection occurred in 433 patients 513 times. The overall nosocomial infection rate was 6.82%. The overall hospitalization days were 73 663 and nosocomial infection patient-day rates were 6.96 per thousand. The VAP infection rate was 28.7 per thousand. The CRBSI rate was 3.5 per thousand. Gestational age (OR = 1.049), mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.810), umbilical vein catheter (OR = 1.106), hospitalization days (OR = 1.081), premature rupture of membrane (OR = 1.433) were the risk factors for the development of nosocomial infection. There were 197 (38.4%) cases of pneumonia, which was the most common nosocomial infection in Neonatal Ward. There were 129 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which accounts for 65.5% of pneumonia and 24.4% of cases treated with ventilator. The next was sepsis, 124 cases (24.2%) and 64 cases of diarrheal disease (12.7%). One hundred and eighty two (54.4%) strains of isolates were Gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. The predominant pathogens of Gram-negative bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (8.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.2%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.8%) and Escherichia coli (4.8%). The isolation rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were 91.4% and 75%, respectively. Those two bacteria were universally resistant to cephalosporins. The rate of resistance to imipenem of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 1.5%, 11.1% and 41.7%. The isolation rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were 28.6% and 95.5%. CONCLUSION: It is important to identify the high risk factors for nosocomial infections in newborn infants. To shorten time for mechanical ventilation and hospitalization days, removal of the central venous catheter as early as possible would be conducive to reducing the morbidity of nosocomial infection. The main pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria. The multidrug resistance of Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters is serious.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of "last-resort" antibiotics against unusual nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli clinical isolates.
AB  - In this prospective multicentric study, we assessed the in vitro antimicrobial activity of carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem), tigecycline, and colistin against 166 unusual nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NF-GNB) clinical isolates collected from nine French hospitals during a 6-month period (from December 1, 2008, to May 31, 2009). All NF-GNB isolates were included, except those phenotypically identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobial agents were determined by using the E-test technique. The following microorganisms were identified: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=72), Pseudomonas spp. (n=30), Achromobacter xylosoxidans (n=25), Acinetobacter spp. (n=18), Burkholderia cepacia complex (n=9), Alcaligenes faecalis (n=7), and Delftia spp. (n=5). All isolates of Acinetobacter spp., A. faecalis, and Delftia spp. were susceptible to the three carbapenems. Imipenem exhibited the lowest MICs against Pseudomonas spp., and meropenem, as compared with imipenem and doripenem, displayed an interesting antimicrobial activity against A. xylosoxidans and B. cepacia complex isolates. Conversely, no carbapenem exhibited any activity against S. maltophilia. Except for S. maltophilia isolates, tigecycline and colistin exhibited higher MICs than carbapenems, but covered most of the microorganisms tested in this study. To our knowledge, no prior study has compared antimicrobial activity of these five antibiotics, often considered as "last-resort" treatment options for resistant Gram-negative infections, against unusual NF-GNB clinical isolates. Further studies should be carried out to assess the potential clinical use of these antibiotics for the treatment of infections due to these microorganisms.
TI  - Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Dioscorea bulbifera tuber extract and evaluation of its synergistic potential in combination with antimicrobial agents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Development of an environmentally benign process for the synthesis of silver nanomaterials is an important aspect of current nanotechnology research. Among the 600 species of the genus Dioscorea, Dioscorea bulbifera has profound therapeutic applications due to its unique phytochemistry. In this paper, we report on the rapid synthesis of silver nanoparticles by reduction of aqueous Ag(+) ions using D. bulbifera tuber extract. METHODS AND RESULTS: Phytochemical analysis revealed that D. bulbifera tuber extract is rich in flavonoid, phenolics, reducing sugars, starch, diosgenin, ascorbic acid, and citric acid. The biosynthesis process was quite fast, and silver nanoparticles were formed within 5 hours. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction confirmed reduction of the Ag(+) ions. Varied morphology of the bioreduced silver nanoparticles included spheres, triangles, and hexagons. Optimization studies revealed that the maximum rate of synthesis could be achieved with 0.7 mM AgNO(3) solution at 50 degrees C in 5 hours. The resulting silver nanoparticles were found to possess potent antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Beta-lactam (piperacillin) and macrolide (eryth-romycin) antibiotics showed a 3.6-fold and 3-fold increase, respectively, in combination with silver nanoparticles selectively against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Notable synergy was seen between silver nanoparticles and chloramphenicol or vancomycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was supported by a 4.9-fold and 4.2-fold increase in zone diameter, respectively. Similarly, we found a maximum 11.8-fold increase in zone diameter of streptomycin when combined with silver nanoparticles against E. coli, providing strong evidence for the synergistic action of a combination of antibiotics and silver nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using D. bulbifera tuber extract followed by an estimation of its synergistic potential for enhancement of the antibacterial activity of broad spectrum antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Inhaled colistin for lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lower respiratory tract infections, due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii, are frequently encountered in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or in patients developing nosocomial pneumonias. Both of these conditions bear a high mortality risk and aggressive antibiotic therapy is necessary. Inhaled antibiotics might represent an effective therapeutic approach for these diseases as it has demonstrated good bactericidal efficacy and safety in both preclinical and clinical studies. This colistin formulation might be useful particularly in patients with respiratory tract infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Its main advantages are a better safety profile with a minimal or absent risk of nephrotoxicity. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the available systemic formulations of colistin, with pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, followed by an overview of inhaled antibiotics in lower respiratory tract infections. EXPERT OPINION: Inhaled colistin should be used selectively as monotherapy in chronic infections with P. aeruginosa in CF patients, whereas in patients with hospital/ventilator-acquired pneumonia (HAP/VAP), it should be used in a combined regimen with systemic antibiotics.
TI  - Characterization of bacterial biofilms formed on urinary catheters.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The formation of bacterial biofilms on urinary catheters is a leading cause of urinary tract infections in intensive care units. Cytobacteriological examination of urine from patients is often misleading, due to the formation of these biofilms. Therefore, characterizing these biofilms and identifying the bacterial species residing on the surface of catheters are of major importance. METHODS: We studied the formation of biofilms on the inner surface of urinary catheters using microbiological culture techniques, with the direct contact of catheter pieces with blood agar. The bacterial species on the surface were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and the kinetic profile of biofilm formation on a silicone substrate for an imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bacterium was evaluated with a crystal violet staining assay. RESULTS: The bacterial species that constituted these biofilms were identified as a variety of gram-negative bacilli, with a predominance of strains belonging to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The other isolated strains belonged to A baumannii and Klebsiella ornithinolytica. Kinetic profiling of biofilm formation identified the transient behavior of A baumannii between its biofilm and planktonic state. This strain was highly resistant to all of the antibiotics tested except colistin. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the identified isolated species formed a dense and interconnected network of cellular multilayers formed from either a single cell or from different species that were surrounded and enveloped by a protective matrix. CONCLUSIONS: Microbiological analysis of the intraluminal surface of the catheter is required for true identification of the causative agents of catheter-associated urinary tract infections. This approach, combined with a routine cytobacteriological examination of urine, allows for the complete characterization of biofilm-associated species, and also may help prevent biofilm formation in such devices and help guide optimum antibiotic treatment.
TI  - "Swimming in resistance": Co-colonization with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Co-colonization of patients with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is reported to be associated with increased antibiotic resistance and mortality. METHODS: CREs isolated between September 2008 and September 2009 were analyzed at Detroit Medical Center. Patients who had an additional isolation of AB or PA during the period spanning 7 days before to 7 days after CRE isolation were considered co-colonized. Molecular typing was used to determine genetic similarity among CRE strains. RESULTS: Eighty-six unique patient isolates of CREs were analyzed. Thirty-four patients (40%) were co-colonized, and 26 (79%) had AB or PA isolated on the same day as the CRE. High Charlson Comorbidity Index score was an independent predictor for co-colonization. Recent stay at a long-term acute-care facility and previous therapy with antimicrobials with activity only against gram-positive microorganisms also were associated with co-colonization, but did not remain significant independent predictors. Co-colonization was associated with higher levels of resistance to carbapenems among CREs and increased 90-day mortality. Molecular typing revealed CRE polyclonality in co-colonized patients. CONCLUSIONS: Co-colonization is found in patients with the greatest disease burden in the hospital and occurs due to the dissemination of multiple CRE strains. This finding calls into question the practice of cohorting patients with CRE in close proximity to patients with AB or PA.
TI  - New heterocyclic compounds from 1,2,4-triazole and 1,3,4-thiadiazole class bearing diphenylsulfone moieties. Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity evaluation.
AB  - Some new 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-4-(R)-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3(4H)-thiones 4a,b; 5a,b and 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N-(R)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amines 6a,b; 7a,b were obtained by cyclization of new N(1)-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-N(4)-(R)-thiosemicarbazides 2a,b; 3a,b (X=H, Br). The 1,2,4-triazoles were synthesized by intramolecular cyclization of acylthiosemicarbazides, in basic media. On the other hand, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles were obtained from same acylthiosemicarbazides, in acidic media. These new intermediates from thiosemicarbazide class were afforded by the reaction of 4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoic acids hydrazides (X=H, Br) 1a,b with 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl isothiocyanate. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. All the new compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activity against some bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 13061, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 49141, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and yeasts (Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019).
TI  - Management of antimicrobial use in the intensive care unit.
AB  - Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are frequently  treated with antimicrobials. The appropriate and judicious use of antimicrobial treatment in the ICU setting is a constant clinical challenge for healthcare staff due to the appearance and spread of new multiresistant pathogens and the need to update knowledge of factors involved in the selection of multiresistance and in the patient's clinical response. In order to optimize the efficacy of empirical antibacterial treatments and to reduce the selection of multiresistant pathogens, different strategies have been advocated, including de-escalation therapy and pre-emptive therapy as well as measurement of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pK/pD) parameters for proper dosing adjustment. Although the theoretical arguments of all these strategies are very attractive, evidence of their effectiveness is scarce. The identification of the concentration-dependent and time-dependent activity pattern of antimicrobials allow the classification of drugs into three groups, each group with its own pK/pD characteristics, which are the basis for the identification of new forms of administration of antimicrobials to optimize their efficacy (single dose, loading dose, continuous infusion) and to decrease toxicity. The appearance of new multiresistant pathogens, such as imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Acinetobacter baumannii, carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria harbouring carbapenemases, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., has determined the use of new antibacterials, the reintroduction of other drugs that have been removed in the past due to toxicity or the use of combinations with in vitro synergy. Finally, pharmacoeconomic aspects should be considered for the choice of appropriate antimicrobials in the care of critically ill patients.
TI  - Garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  - When thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. Within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. As the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. In the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (Allium sativum). Wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (GarO) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. Biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. GarO prevented biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within Enterococcus faecalis biofilms. Additionally, GarO disrupted partially developed biofilms produced by S. aureus, S. epidermidis and A. baumannii. The antistaphylococcal activity of GarO was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. Thus, GarO could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound biofilms caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.
TI  - Efficacy of ertapenem for treatment of bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Ertapenem is active against extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae organisms but inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Due to a lack of therapeutic data for ertapenem in the treatment of ESBL bloodstream infections (BSIs), group 2 carbapenems (e.g., imipenem or meropenem) are often preferred for treatment of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, although their antipseudomonal activity is unnecessary. From 2005 to 2010, 261 patients with ESBL BSIs were analyzed. Outcomes were equivalent between patients treated with ertapenem and those treated with group 2 carbapenems (mortality rates of 6% and 18%, respectively; P = 0.18).
TI  - Stenotrophomonas maltophilia--the most worrisome threat among unusual non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli from hospitalized patients: a prospective multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Isolation rates of unusual non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (i.e. other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii) are increasing but studies are limited to few observations. We aimed at determining risk factors for infection and influence of antibiotic treatment on the outcome. METHODS: A six-month (December 1, 2008-May 31, 2009) prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted in nine French teaching hospitals. Characteristics of patients colonized or infected by unusual NF-GNB, adequacy of antimicrobial therapies, and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Analysis of 158 patients (median age, 62.7 years) was conducted. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was the predominant bacterial species isolated (39%) followed by Achromobacter group (15%) and non-baumannii Acinetobacter species (13%). Compared to colonized patients, infected ones were more frequently immunocompromised [relative risk (RR) = 1.63, (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-2.60, P = 0.05)], hospitalized within the last three months [RR 1.67 (95% CI 1.09-2.58, P = 0.02)], admitted in an intensive care unit with central venous catheter [RR 1.74 (95% CI 1.15-2.63, P = 0.01)]. The overall hospital mortality concerned 28 patients (18%) but no association with inadequate antimicrobial treatment was found except in the group of S. maltophilia infected cases [RR 2.81 (95% CI 1.01-7.83, P = 0.02)]. CONCLUSION: Naturally carbapenems-resistant S. maltophilia is the main unusual NF-GNB pathogen in hospitalized patients, leading to inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment at the time of emerging extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity studies of doripenem and two other carbapenems tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative bacilli.
AB  - Over the past decade, an increasing prevalence of infections caused by non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria has been reported in many countries. Among these bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii have been associated with high mortality and treatment failures. Treatment options for multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii infections are limited to carbapenems in most cases. The mechanisms of carbapenem resistance have been identified in P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative non-fermenters, including enzyme production, overexpression of efflux pumps, porin deficiencies, and target- site alterations. This article reviews the in vitro activity of doripenem and compares it with that of imipenem and meropenem against a large collection of non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli, obtained in worldwide surveillance studies between 2000 and 2010. A detailed examination of the available data demonstrate that doripenem has more potent in vitro antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species compared to other carbapenems. Furthermore, doripenem has a limited ability to select for carbapenem-resistant mutants in vitro.
TI  - [The comparison of patients with hospitalized health-care-associated pneumonia to community-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - Health-care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is defined as pneumonia that develops in  patients with a history of recent hospitalization, hemodialysis as an outpatient, residence in a nursing home, outpatient intravenous therapy and home wound care. We aimed to compare the initial demographic characteristics, causative agents and prognosis between hospitalized HCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients. HCAP and CAP patients hospitalized between 01 September 2008-01 September 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. Out of 187 patients (131 males, mean age 66.3 +/- 14.3 years) who were hospitalized during one-year period, 98 were diagnosed as HCAP and 89 as CAP. Among HCAP patients, 64 (65.3%) had a history of hospitalization in the last 90 days, 26 (26.5%) received outpatient intravenous therapy, 17 (17.3%) had home wound care, 6 (6.1%) were on hemodialysis program in the last 30 days and 4 (4.1%) lived in a nursing home. The causative pathogen was detected in 39 (39.8%) HCAP and 8 (9.0%) CAP patients. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in HCAP, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in CAP patients. Inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment was documented in 8 (25.8%) of 39 HCAP patients, in whom a causative agent was isolated whereas the antibiotic treatment was appropriate in all CAP patients. The duration of hospitalization (14.4 +/- 11.4 vs. 10.7 +/- 7.9 days, p= 0.011) and mortality rate (34.7% vs. 9.0%, p< 0.001) were higher in HCAP compared with CAP patients. As HCAP is different than CAP in terms of patients' characteristics, causative microorganisms and prognosis, it should be considered in all patients hospitalized as CAP. Potentially drug-resistant microorganisms should be taken into consideration in the empirical antibiotic treatment of these patients.
TI  - Rapid detection of carbapenemase genes by multiplex real-time PCR.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a single multiplex real-time PCR assay to detect six different genetic types of carbapenemases already identified in Enterobacteriaceae (KPC, GES, NDM, IMP, VIM and OXA-48). METHODS: A total of 58 bacterial isolates were tested. Thirty were previously characterized as resistant to carbapenems and documented by PCR and sequencing analysis to carry the following genes: bla(KPC) type, bla(GES) type, bla(IMP) type, bla(VIM) type, bla(OXA-48) and bla(NDM-1). These positive strains included 21 Enterobacteriaceae, 1 Acinetobacter baumannii and 8 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. The remaining 28 isolates previously tested susceptible to carbapenems and were negative for these genes. Bacterial DNA was extracted using the easyMag extractor (bioMerieux, France). The real-time PCR was performed using the Rotor-Gene 6000 instrument (Corbett Life Science, Australia) and specific primers for each carbapenemase target were designed using the DNAStar software (Madison, WI, USA). RESULTS: Each one of the six carbapenemase genes tested presented a different melting curve after PCR amplification. The melting temperature (T(m)) analysis of the amplicons identified was as follows: bla(IMP) type (T(m) 80.1 degrees C), bla(OXA-48) (T(m) 81.6 degrees C), bla(NDM-1) (T(m) 84 degrees C), bla(GES) type (T(m) 88.6 degrees C), bla(VIM) type (T(m) 90.3 degrees C) and bla(KPC) type (T(m) 91.6 degrees C). No amplification was detected among the negative samples. The results showed 100% concordance with the genotypes previously identified. CONCLUSIONS: The new assay was able to detect the presence of six different carbapenemase gene types in a single 3 h PCR.
TI  - Predicting bacterial fitness cost associated with drug resistance.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It has been proposed that antimicrobial resistance could be associated with a fitness cost in bacteria, which is often determined by competition experiments between isogenic strains (wild-type and mutant). However, this conventional approach is time consuming and labour intensive. An alternative method was developed to assess the fitness cost in drug-resistant bacteria. METHODS: Time-growth studies were performed with approximately 1 x 10(5) cfu/mL of Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa at baseline. Serial samples were obtained to quantify the bacterial burden over 24 h. The growth rates (K(g)) of isogenic strains (antibiotic susceptible and resistant) were determined individually and used to predict their relative abundance in a co-culture over an extended period of time. The predicted difference between the two strains was subsequently validated by in vitro growth competition experiments. RESULTS: The growth rates of A. baumannii were not significantly different in different strengths of growth medium. The difference in bacterial burden observed in competition studies was in general agreement with the predicted difference based on K(g) values, suggesting good predicting ability of the mathematical model. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed mathematical model was found to be reasonable in characterizing bacterial growth and predicting the fitness cost of resistance. This simple method appears robust in the assessment of fitness cost associated with drug resistance and warrants further investigations.
TI  - Assessing the pharmacodynamic profile of intravenous antibiotics against prevalent Gram-negative organisms collected in Colombia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to simulate standard and optimized dosing regimens for intravenous antibiotics against contemporary populations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using MIC distribution data to determine which of the tested carbapenem regimens provided the greatest opportunity for obtaining maximal pharmacodynamic (PD) activity. METHODS: The isolates studied were obtained from the COMPACT-COLOMBIA surveillance program conducted between February and November 2009. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by broth microdilution method according to the CLSI guidelines. Doripenem, imipenem-cilastatin, and meropenem, were the modeled antibiotics. A 5,000 patient Monte Carlo simulation was performed for each regimen and PD targets were defined as free drug concentrations above the MIC for at least 40% of the dosing interval. RESULTS: All carbapenem regimens obtained optimal exposures against E. coli, unlike the other Enterobacteriaceae tested. Against P. aeruginosa, only a prolonged infusion of doripenem exceeded the 90% cumulative fraction of response (CFR) threshold. Worrisomely, no regimens for any of the drugs tested obtained optimal CFR against A. baumannii. For P. aeruginosa intensive care unit (ICU) isolates, CFR was approximately 20% lower for isolates collected in the respiratory tract compared with bloodstream or intra-abdominal for imipenem and meropenem. Noteworthy, all doripenem and meropenem regimens achieved greater than 90% CFR against bloodstream and respiratory isolates of K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that higher dosing and prolonged infusion of doripenem or meropenem may be suitable for empirically treating ICU P. aeruginosa, while none of the carbapenems achieved optimal cumulative fraction of response against A. baumannii. Standard dosing regimens of all the carbapenems tested achieved optimal CFR against E. coli isolates, but higher carbapenem dosages might be required for empiric treatment of K. pneumoniae, particularly from an intra-abdominal source. Non-standard dosage regimens studied in this modeling should be proven effective in prospective clinical trials.
TI  - Transfer of multidrug-resistant bacteria to healthcare workers' gloves and gowns  after patient contact increases with environmental contamination.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of environmental contamination in the transmission  of multidrug-resistant bacteria to healthcare workers' clothing. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Six intensive care units at a tertiary care hospital. SUBJECTS: Healthcare workers including registered nurses, patient care technicians, respiratory therapists, occupational/physical therapists, and physicians. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred twenty of 585 (20.5%) healthcare worker/patient interactions resulted in contamination of healthcare workers' gloves or gowns. Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii contamination occurred most frequently, 55 of 167 observations (32.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25.8% to 40.0%), followed by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 15 of 86 (17.4%; 95% CI 9.4% to 25.4%), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, 25 of 180 (13.9%, 95% CI 8.9, 18.9%) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 21 of 152 (13.8%; 95% CI 8.3% to 19.2%). Independent risk factors associated with healthcare worker contamination with multidrug-resistant bacteria were positive environmental cultures (odds ratio [OR] 4.2; 95% CI 2.7-6.5), duration in room for >5 mins (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.4), performing physical examinations (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.8), and contact with the ventilator (OR 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.8). Pulsed field gel electrophoresis determined that 91% of healthcare worker isolates were related to an environmental or patient isolate. CONCLUSIONS: The contamination of healthcare workers' protective clothing during routine care of patients with multidrug-resistant organisms is most frequent with A. baumannii. Environmental contamination was the major determinant of transmission to healthcare workers' gloves or gowns. Compliance with contact precautions and more aggressive environmental cleaning may decrease transmission.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections after liver transplantation - spectrum and risk factors.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gram-negative bacilli infections, especially multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli infections, are the leading cause of high mortality after liver transplantation. This study sought to investigate the type of infection, infection rate, pathogenic spectrum, antibiotic-resistance profile, risk factors, and epidemiology of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infection. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted and data of 217 liver transplant patients receiving cadaveric livers between January 2007 and April 2010 were analyzed. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration test. Extended-spectrum and metallo-beta-lactamase assays were used to analyze beta-lactamase-produced isolates, and repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction was used to differentiate bacterium subspecies. RESULTS: Sixty-seven isolates of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 66 infected liver transplant patients. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (100%, 8/8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (61.5%, 8/13), Enterobacter cloacae (75%, 3/4) and Escherichia coli (81.3%, 13/16) were the most common extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacilli. Metallo-beta-lactamase expressing isolates were identified as S. maltophilia (100%, 8/8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (83.3%, 5/6), Acinetobacter baumannii (95%, 19/20). Significant independent risk factors for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infection were extended use of pre-transplant broad-spectrum antibiotics (OR 9.027, P=0.001) and prolonged (>==72h) endotracheal intubation (OR 3.537, P=0.033). CONCLUSIONS: To reduce the risk of acquiring MDR gram-negative bacillus infections after liver transplant, control measures are required to limit the use of prophylactic antibiotic in preventing infection during liver transplant and to shorten endotracheal intubation time.
TI  - Activity of polymyxin B and the novel polymyxin analogue CB-182,804 against contemporary Gram-negative pathogens in New York City.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have become common in many regions, often requiring therapy with colistin or polymyxin B. An increase in resistance to these agents would render many infections untreatable. We tested the activity of polymyxin B and the novel polymyxin analogue CB-182,804 against over 5,000 recent Gram-negative clinical isolates from New York City, a region with a high prevalence of multiresistant strains. Over 96% of Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa were susceptible to polymyxin B; only 76% of Enterobacter spp. was susceptible. The MICs of CB-182,804 were generally two-fold higher than polymyxin B and cross-resistance was observed. The addition of rifampin resulted in synergistic inhibition and bactericidal activity in time kill studies, and restored activity against all polymyxin-resistant strains. The synergistic effect of the combination with rifampin was most pronounced against A. baumannii strains, and was slightly greater with CB-182,804 than with polymyxin B against K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. Despite considerable usage of polymyxin B and colistin in this region, polymyxin B retains excellent activity against most Gram-negative isolates. CB-182,804 shows similar activity, particularly when combined with rifampin. The clinical utility of CB-182,804 remains to be determined.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  - The antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. Consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. Little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different pH values. Consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of pH on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (SA) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. Forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MDR Vibrio sp, MDR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (ESBL) producing Salmonella sp, ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, ESBL producing Proteus mirabilis, ESBL producing Escherichia coli and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI)]. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-positive isolates at a pH of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. A mean CZOI of 5 mm was recorded for the SCMC dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the SA dressing. At a pH of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. However, at a pH of 8.5 the mean CZOI of the SCMC dressing was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the SA dressing for a select number of isolates. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the Gram-positive bacteria. Susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. Interestingly, when pH was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (P < 0.05). Overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all pH ranges. In addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when pH became more acidic. The findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role pH plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial growth and biofilm production by constituents from Hypericum spp.
AB  - Biofilm embedded bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii are difficult to eradicate and are major sources of bacterial infections. New drugs are needed to combat these pathogens. Hypericum is a plant genus that contains species known to have antimicrobial properties. However, the specific constituents responsible for the antimicrobial properties are not entirely known, nor have most compounds been tested as inhibitors of biofilm development. The investigation presented here tested seven secondary metabolites isolated from the species Hypericum densiflorum, Hypericum ellipticum, Hypericum prolificum, and Hypericum punctatum as inhibitors of bacterial growth and biofilm production. Assays were conducted against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Five of the seven compounds demonstrated growth inhibition against the Gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.95 microg/mL to 7.81 microg/mL. Four of the secondary metabolites inhibited biofilm production by certain Gram-positive strains at sub-MIC concentrations.
TI  - Effects of clinical breakpoint changes in CLSI guidelines 2010/2011 and EUCAST guidelines 2011 on antibiotic susceptibility test reporting of Gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of clinical breakpoint changes in CLSI 2010 and 2011 guidelines and EUCAST 2011 guidelines on antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) reports. METHODS: In total, 3713 non-duplicate clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii were analysed. Inhibition zone diameters were determined for beta-lactams, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. CLSI 2009-11 and EUCAST 2011 clinical breakpoints were applied. RESULTS: Changes in resistance as defined per the guidelines affected individual species and drug classes differently. The cefepime resistance rate in Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae increased from 2.1% and 1.3% to 8.2% and 6.9%, respectively, applying CLSI 2009-11 versus EUCAST 2011 guidelines. Ertapenem resistance rates in E. cloacae increased from 2.6% with CLSI 2009 to 7.2% for CLSI 2010 and 2011, and to 10.1% when applying EUCAST 2011. Cefepime and meropenem resistance rates in P. aeruginosa increased from 12.2% and 20.6% to 19.8% and 27.7%, respectively, comparing CLSI 2009-11 with EUCAST 2011. Tobramycin and gentamicin resistance rates in A. baumannii increased from 15.9% and 25.4% to 34.9% and 44.4% applying CLSI 2009-11 versus EUCAST 2011. CONCLUSIONS: Higher resistance rates reported due to breakpoint changes in CLSI and EUCAST guidelines will result in increasing numbers of Gram-negative bacilli reported as multidrug resistant. AST reports classifying amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefepime or carbapenem resistance will lead clinicians to use alternative agents. Upon implementation of the EUCAST guidelines, laboratories should be aware of the implications of modified drug susceptibility testing reports on antibiotic prescription policies.
TI  - Inactivation of bacterial opportunistic skin pathogens by nonthermal DC-operated  afterglow atmospheric plasma.
AB  - AIMS: Multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogens are clinically significant and  require the development of new antimicrobial methods. In this study, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus cells were exposed to atmospheric plasma on agar plates and in vitro on porcine skin for the purpose of testing bacterial inactivation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microbial inactivation at varying exposure durations was tested using a nonthermal plasma jet generated with a DC voltage from ambient air. The observed reduction in colony forming units was quantified as log(10) reductions. CONCLUSIONS: Direct plasma exposure significantly inactivated seeded bacterial cells by approx. 6 log(10) on agar plates and 2-3 log(10) on porcine skin. On agar plates, an indirect 'bystander' inactivation outside the plasma delivery area was also observed. The reduced inactivation observed on the skin surface was most likely due to cell protection by the variable surface architecture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Atmospheric plasma has potential for clinical application as a disinfectant of patient skin and medically relevant surfaces.
TI  - Colistin therapy in critically ill patients with chronic renal failure and its effect on development of renal dysfunction.
AB  - Recently, colistin has become a salvage therapy in the treatment of serious Intensive Care Unit infections owing to the emergence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacterial isolates. This study aimed to show the effectiveness of colistin in critically ill patients with renal failure. A prospective case-control study of 94 patients admitted to medical intensive care units of a university hospital from December 2008 to June 2010 was conducted. All patients had infections with XDR Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and received colistin. Cases comprised 39 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and controls were other patients without CRF. Apart from the male dominancy in the CRF group, there was no statistical difference between the two groups regarding demographic characteristics, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and site and type of infection. In patients who completed colistin therapy, bacteriological cure was seen in 87% of patients with CRF and 95% of patients without CRF (P=0.890). Mortality in patients with CRF was similar to that in patients without CRF (44% and 42%, respectively) (P=0.999). Nephrotoxicity developed in 23.6% of patients in the control group. Concomitant nephrotoxic agents and total defined daily dose of colistin did not affect the development of nephrotoxicity. The mortality rate was 38% in patients with nephrotoxicity, similar to the mortality rate in patients without nephrotoxicity (36%) (P=0.999). In conclusion, in critically ill patients with CRF, colistin therapy, although used at a reduced dosage, was as effective as in patients without CRF.
TI  - Activity of tigecycline and comparators against skin and skin structure pathogens: global results of the Tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial, 2004-2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This analysis from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) reports on 24 784 isolates collected from integumentary culture sources between 2004 and 2009. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and susceptibility were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (US Food and Drug Administration breakpoints applied against tigecycline). RESULTS: All methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. MIC(90)s for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium ranged between 0.12 mg/l and 0.25mg/l. Resistance to the carbapenems and tigecycline was low among the Enterobacteriaceae, with resistance at </= 2.0% between 2004 and 2009 for tigecycline against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, and Serratia marcescens, for imipenem against E. coli and Enterobacter spp, and for meropenem against E. coli, Enterobacter spp, and S. marcescens. Against the Acinetobacter baumannii collected in 2009, resistance to amikacin, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam was >30%; between 2004 and 2009 resistance to minocycline varied between 1.4% and 4.8%, and tigecycline MIC(90)s were </= 2mg/l. Against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected, MIC(90)s were greater than the susceptibility breakpoint for cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, levofloxacin, and meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: The problem of antimicrobial resistance is demonstrated by the data presented. T.E.S.T. continues to provide valuable information on antimicrobial resistance globally.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in isolated bacteria  from seawater of Algiers beaches (Algeria).
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate bacterial antibiotic resistance in seawater  from four beaches in Algiers. The most significant resistance rates were observed for amoxicillin and ticarcillin, whereas they were relatively low for ceftazidime, cefotaxime and imipenem. According to sampling sites, the highest resistance rates were recorded for 2 sites subjected to chemical and microbiological inputs (amoxicillin, 43% and 52%; ticarcillin, 19.6% and 47.7%), and for 2 sites relatively preserved from anthropogenic influence, resistance rates were lowest (amoxicillin, 1.5% and 16%; ticarcillin, 0.8% and 2.6%). Thirty-four bacteria resistant to imipenem (n=14) or cefotaxime (n=20) were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=15), Pseudomonas fluorescens (7), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), Burkholderia cepacia (2), Bordetella sp. (1), Pantoea sp. (1), Acinetobacter baumannii (1), Chryseomonas luteola (1), Ochrobactrum anthropi (1) and Escherichia coli (1). Screening for extended spectrum beta-lactamase showed the presence of CTX-M-15 beta-lactamase in the E. coli isolate, and the encoding gene was transferable in association with the IncI1 plasmid of about 50 kbp. Insertion sequence ISEcp1B was located upstream of the CTX-M-15 gene. This work showed a significant level of resistance to antibiotics, mainly among environmental saprophytic bacteria. Transmissible CTX-M-15 was detected in E. coli; this may mean that contamination of the environment by resistant bacteria may cause the spread of resistance genes.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated transfer of the bla(NDM-1) gene in Gram-negative rods.
AB  - The latest threat of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria corresponds to the emergence of carbapenemase NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase) producers, mostly in Enterobacteriacae. Five bla(NDM) (-1) -positive plasmids of different incompatibility groups (IncL/M, FII, A/C and two untypeable plasmids) from clinical Enterobacteriaceae were evaluated for conjugation properties and host specificity. Successful conjugative transfers were obtained using all tested enterobacterial species as recipients (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus mirabilis) and all plasmid types. Conjugation frequencies varied from 1 x 10(-4) to 6 x 10(-8) transconjugants per donor. Higher conjugation rates were obtained for two plasmids at 30 degrees C compared with that observed at 25 and 37 degrees C. Carbapenems used as selector did not lead to higher conjugation frequencies. None of the five plasmids was transferable to Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa by conjugation. This work underlines how efficient the spread of the carbapenemase bla(NDM) (-1) gene could be among Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Risk factors for nosocomial infection and mortality in burn patients: 10 years of experience at a university hospital.
AB  - To evaluate the risk factors for nosocomial infection (NI) and mortality in a university hospital, 10-year data of burn patients were assessed retrospectively. The study was conducted at Erciyes University's Burn Center during 2000 and 2009. The records of 1190 patients were obtained. Overall, 131 (11%) patients had 206 NIs with an incidence density of 14.7 infections/1000 patient days. Burn wound infection (n = 109, 53%) was the most common NI. High (%TBSA burned) and late excision were found to be the most significant risk factors for the development of NI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent causative microorganism. However, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has increased in recent years with a prevalence of 47% in 2009. The carbapenem resistance of P. aeruginosa has decreased in recent years, whereas that of A. baumannii increased and it had a prevalence of 94% in the last year. Conversely, the most important risk factors for mortality were advanced age, high %TBSA and having an underlying disease. Prevention of NI is an important issue in burn units to reduce mortality rates. Early excision and wound closure are important therapeutic approaches for the prevention of burn wound infection.
TI  - Distinctive attributes of beta-lactam target proteins in Acinetobacter baumannii  relevant to development of new antibiotics.
AB  - Multi-drug-resistant forms of the Gram-negative pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii  are an emerging threat to human health and further complicate the general problem of treating serious bacterial infections. Meeting this challenge requires an improved understanding of the relationships between the structures of major therapeutic targets in this organism and the activity levels exhibited against it by different antibiotics. Here we report the first crystal structures of A. baumannii penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) covalently inactivated by four beta-lactam antibiotics. We also relate the results to kinetic, biophysical, and computational data. The structure of the class A protein PBP1a was solved in apo form and for its covalent conjugates with benzyl penicillin, imipenem, aztreonam, and the siderophore-conjugated monocarbam MC-1. It included a novel domain genetically spliced into a surface loop of the transpeptidase domain that contains three conserved loops. Also reported here is the first high-resolution structure of the A. baumannii class B enzyme PBP3 in apo form. Comparison of this structure with that of MC-1-derivatized PBP3 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified differences between these orthologous proteins in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Thermodynamic analyses indicated that desolvation effects in the PBP3 ligand-binding sites contributed significantly to the thermal stability of the enzyme-antibiotic covalent complexes. Across a significant range of values, they correlated well with results from studies of inactivation kinetics and the protein structures. The structural, biophysical, and computational data help rationalize differences in the functional performance of antibiotics against different protein targets and can be used to guide the design of future agents.
TI  - Antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.
AB  - Fermentation extracts from fungi isolated from vineyard ecosystems were tested for antimicrobial activities against a set of test microorganisms, including five food-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus EP167, Acinetobacter baumannii (clinically isolated), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Escherichia coli O157:H7 (CECT 5947) and Candida albicans MY1055) and two probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum LCH17 and Lactobacillus brevis LCH23). A total of 182 fungi was grown in eight different media, and the fermentation extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. A total of 71 fungi produced extracts active against at least one pathogenic microorganism, but not against any probiotic bacteria. The Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus EP167 was more susceptible to antimicrobial fungi broth extracts than Gram-negative bacteria and pathogenic fungi. Identification of active fungi based on internal transcribed spacer rRNA sequence analysis revealed that species in the orders Pleosporales, Hypocreales and Xylariales dominated. Differences in antimicrobial selectivity were observed among isolates from the same species. Some compounds present in the active extracts were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial metabolites produced by vineyard ecosystem fungi may potentially limit colonization and spoilage of food products by food-borne pathogens, with minimal effect on probiotic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of avibactam (NXL104) in combination with beta-lactams against  Gram-negative bacteria, including OXA-48 beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of avibactam (formerly NXL104) in combination with imipenem, cefepime or ceftazidime against Gram-negative bacteria. Bacterial isolates included: Pseudomonas aeruginosa harbouring PER-1 beta-lactamase (n=14); Acinetobacter baumannii harbouring PER-1, OXA-51 and OXA-58 (n=20); carbapenem-non-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and Escherichia coli (n=1) harbouring OXA-48; carbapenem-non-susceptible E. coli (n=1) harbouring both IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamase and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL); carbapenem-non-susceptible Serratia marcescens (n=1); and carbapenem-susceptible E. coli (n=20) and K. pneumoniae isolates (n=12) with CTX-M-15 ESBL. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime were determined in combination with 4 mg/L avibactam by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) method on Mueller-Hinton agar. Imipenem/avibactam and ceftazidime/avibactam displayed limited potency against A. baumannii isolates, whereas cefepime/avibactam and ceftazidime/avibactam were active against P. aeruginosa. Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with OXA-48 beta-lactamase were resistant to imipenem [MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) >/=4 mg/L]. MIC(90) values for the combination of avibactam 4 mg/L with imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime were in the susceptible range for all strains (MIC(90)</=0.5mg/L). All E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates with CTX-M-15 beta-lactamase were inhibited at </=1 mg/L for combinations with avibactam and 100% were susceptible by CLSI breakpoint criteria to imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime. In conclusion, combinations of imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime with avibactam may present a promising therapeutic strategy to treat infections due to K. pneumoniae with OXA-48 enzyme as well as K. pneumoniae and E. coli with CTX-M-15 enzyme.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance pattern for gram-negative uropathogens isolated from hospitalised patients and outpatients in Cartagena, 2005-2008].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determining the microbial aetiology spectrum and antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitalised patients and outpatients. METHODS: A descriptive study was carried out between February 2005 and November 2008 at the San Buenaventura University's Clinical Laboratory in Cartagena. Antibiotic sensitivity was determined by the Kirby Bauer method. RESULTS: Out of the total specimens (1,384) analysed over the four-year study period, 455 of the urine samples (32.9 %) were culture positive, most (81.4 %) having come from females. The bacterium isolated most frequently was Escherichia coli (60.1 %) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.9 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.6 %), Proteus mirabilis (5.4 %) and Acinetobacter baumannii (1.4 %). The Gram-negative isolates displayed a high level of resistance to ampicillin (range 84.3100 %), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (range 66.580 %) and ciprofloxacin (range 4057.9 %). CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for urinary tract infections in the patients involved in this study. The most commonly isolated bacteria were E. coli. Empirical administration of a third-generation cephalosporin for initial treatment of urinary tract infections in this population appears prudent from the perspective of antimicrobial susceptibility.
TI  - Clinical predictors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia in patients admitted to the ED.
AB  - The identification of clinical characteristics that could identify patients at high risk for Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia would aid clinicians in the appropriate management of these life-threatening conditions, especially in patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) with community-onset infections. To determine clinical risk factors for P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii bacteremia in patients with community-onset gram-negative bacteremia (GNB), a post hoc analysis of a nationwide bacteremia surveillance database including patients with microbiologically documented GNB was performed. Ninety-six patients with P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii bacteremia were compared with 1230 patients with Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia. A solid tumor or hematologic malignancy was more likely to be associated with P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii bacteremia, whereas concurrent neurologic disease was less frequently seen. In regards to the site of infection, pneumonia was more common in P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii bacteremia, whereas a urinary tract infection was less frequently seen. Factors associated with P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii bacteremia in multivariate analysis included pneumonia (odds ratio [OR], 3.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.86-6.99), hematologic malignancy (OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.26-5.84), male sex (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.31-3.58), solid tumor (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.15-3.12), and health-care-associated infection (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.48-2.41). Our data suggest that an initial empirical antimicrobial coverage of P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii bacteremia should be seriously considered in patients with pneumonia, a hematologic malignancy, solid tumor, or health-care-associated infection, when GNB is suspected, even in community-onset infections.
TI  - Combination antibiotic therapy for empiric and definitive treatment of gram-negative infections: insights from the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists.
AB  - The widespread emergence of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative organisms has compromised the utility of current treatment options for severe infections caused by these pathogens. The rate of gram-negative multidrug resistance is worsening, threatening the effectiveness of newer broad-spectrum antibiotic agents. Infections associated with multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacteriaceae are having a substantial impact on hospital costs and mortality rates. The potential for these resistant gram-negative nosocomial pathogens must always be a primary consideration when selecting antibiotic therapy for critically ill patients. Empiric combination therapy directed at gram-negative pathogens is a logical approach for patients with suspected health care-associated infections, particularly those with risk factors for infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. Although in vitro synergy tests have shown potential benefits of continued combination therapy, convincing clinical data that demonstrate a need for combination therapy once susceptibilities are known are lacking. Thus, deescalation to a single agent once susceptibilities are known is recommended for most patients and pathogens. Use of polymyxins, often in combination with other antimicrobials, may be necessary for salvage therapy.
TI  - [In vitro evaluation of bactericidal activity of an over-heated saturated dry atomized steam electro-medical device on inert contaminated surfaces].
AB  - Surface disinfection together with cleaning practises and aseptic procedures are  established measures for effective prevention of infectious diseases reducing infection risks. In this study, we evaluated the bactericidal effectiveness in vitro of the electro-medical device Sani System, an over-heated saturated dry-steam disinfection system, against predetermined bacterial load dried on inert surfaces. In particular we have tested different materials, representative of operating rooms furnishing and walls commonly used in healthcare setting, with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii. As a result of treatment, the mean bacterial load on all the test surfaces was reduced by a factor of 102 in the contact plate experimental study and by a factor of 10 in the total bioburden experimental study. The Sani System Polti proved to be efficacious in killing 100% of the bacteria in all experimental conditions, therefore it could help to reduce the risk of spreading nosocomial infections in healthcare facilities.
TI  - [Review of the effectiveness of an empirical antibiotic therapy in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occurs in approximately 10-20%  of mechanically ventilated patients, and is associated with an extremely high mortality rate (up to 70%). The purpose of the study was to determine the susceptibility spectrum of Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter strains isolated from VAP patients. METHODS: We analysed 81 strains of microorganisms isolated from bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) of VAP patients. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antibiotics recommended for empirical therapy were determined using an automated VITEK 2 system, and for the MIC of doripenem - the Etest assay. Results were analysed following the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: For infections caused by the group of bacteria under investigation, the most successful regimen was monotherapy with carbapenems (doripenem, meropenem and imipenem). Cephalosporins (cefepim and ceftazidim) were less effective in vitro. The worst results were obtained with the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam with aminoglycosides (amikacin or gentamicin) or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic monotherapy proved to be more effective in VAP patients than combined therapy; the best results were achieved with carbapenems. Doripenem showed strong activity in vitro against P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella sp. and should be considered for empirical VAP therapy; however, carbapenems may be less effective against Acinetobacter baumannii. The wide range of bacteria, and their broad range of susceptibility to antibiotics, suggests the need for modification of current recommendations.
TI  - Antimicrobial fibers: therapeutic possibilities and recent advances.
AB  - The emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (carbapenemase)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is becoming a serious threat. New-generation antimicrobial agents need to be developed. This includes the design of novel antimicrobial compounds and drug-delivery systems. This review provides an introduction into different classes of antimicrobial materials. The main focus is on strategies for the introduction of antimicrobial properties in polymer materials. These can be roughly divided into surface modification, inclusion of antimicrobial compounds that can leach from the polymer, and the introduction of polymer-bound moieties that provide the polymer with antimicrobial properties. One of the main challenges in the development of antimicrobial polymers for the use in contact with human tissue is the concomitant demand of non-cytotoxicity. Current research is strongly focused on the latter aspect.
TI  - Genetic characterization of an extended-spectrum AmpC cephalosporinase with hydrolysing activity against fourth-generation cephalosporins in a clinical isolate of Enterobacter aerogenes selected in vivo.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum AmpC cephalosporinases (ESACs) have been reported in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Here, we characterize a new AmpC variant presenting a broadened substrate activity towards fourth-generation cephalosporins, selected in vivo following cefepime treatment for Enterobacter aerogenes. METHODS: Two consecutive clonally related isolates of E. aerogenes were evaluated. Screening for ESAC production was performed using plates containing 200 mg/L cloxacillin. MICs were determined by microdilution (CLSI guidelines). bla(AmpC) genes were cloned into a pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. The ampC genes were cloned into vector pGEX-6P-1 for protein purification. RESULTS: Isolate Ea595 was resistant to two fourth-generation cephalosporins, cefepime and cefpirome; using plates containing cloxacillin, susceptibility to ceftazidime and cefepime was restored, suggesting overproduction of the ESAC beta-lactamase. Sequencing identified a new AmpC beta-lactamase variant presenting one amino acid substitution, Val291Gly, inside the H-10 helix. Recombinant plasmids harbouring this ESAC beta-lactamase conferred a broadened resistance profile to cefepime and cefpirome, with resistance levels increasing from 16- to 32-fold in E. coli. AmpC-Ea595 hydrolysed ceftazidime, cefepime and cefpirome at high levels, presenting a lower K(m) and enabling us to classify the enzyme as an ESAC. Homology modelling suggested that the size of the active site could have increased. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized an ESAC beta-lactamase selected in vivo and conferring a high level of resistance to fourth-generation cephalosporins in E. aerogenes. The broadened spectrum was caused by a new modification to the H-10 helix, which modified the active site.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic assay for diagnosing the production of IMP-type metallo-beta-lactamases that mediate carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Rapid and reliable detection of carbapenem-resistant bacteria is an important infection-control measure and a crucial aspect of antimicrobial chemotherapy. IMP-type metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) is an emzyme that mediate carbapenem resistance in bacteria. Here, an immunochromatographic assay was newly developed using novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing IMP-type MBL. Epitope mapping of mAbs and mutational analysis of the epitope region in IMP antigen suggested that the mAbs could react to all known subtypes of IMP-type MBL. Evaluation of the assay using Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (n=248) showed that the results of the immunochromatographic detection of the IMP-type MBLs were fully consistent with those of the PCR analysis for bla(IMP) genes, showing false positives and negatives. All positive strains were resistant to carbapenem (MIC >/= 16 mug/ml). The assay also accurately distinguished the production of IMP-type MBLs in Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The detection limit of the assay was 5.7x10(4)cfu per test. Taken together, these data suggest that the developed assay can be used for rapid and reliable diagnosis of the production of IMP-type MBLs in Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial studies of silver carbene complexes: activity of free and  nanoparticle carbene formulations against clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Silver carbenes may represent novel, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have low toxicity while providing varying chemistry for targeted applications. Here, the bactericidal activity of four silver carbene complexes (SCCs) with different formulations, including nanoparticles (NPs) and micelles, was tested against a panel of clinical strains of bacteria and fungi that are the causative agents of many skin and soft tissue, respiratory, wound, blood, and nosocomial infections. METHODS: MIC, MBC and multidose experiments were conducted against a broad range of bacteria and fungi. Time-release and cytotoxicity studies of the compounds were also carried out. Free SCCs and SCC NPs were tested against a panel of medically important pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia and Klebsiella pneumoniae. RESULTS: All four SCCs demonstrated strong efficacy in concentration ranges of 0.5-90 mg/L. Clinical bacterial isolates with high inherent resistance to purified compounds were more effectively treated either with an NP formulation of these compounds or by repeated dosing. Overall, the compounds were active against highly resistant bacterial strains, such as MRSA and MRAB, and were active against the biodefence pathogens Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis. All of the medically important bacterial strains tested play a role in many different infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The four SCCs described here, including their development as NP therapies, show great promise for treating a wide variety of bacterial and fungal pathogens that are not easily killed by routine antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Reliability of Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method for detecting meropenem resistance among non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meropenem is empirically used as a last resort for the treatment of infections by non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined using agar or broth dilution methods is widely used for testing meropenem resistance. However, it is not possible in resource-poor settings. AIM: A prospective study was performed to evaluate the reliability of Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion (KBDD) method for detecting meropenem resistance among NFGNB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 146 NFGNB consisting of 56 Acinetobacter baumannii, 24 Acinetobacter lwoffii, 48 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 18 Pseudomonas spp. were included in the study. All the isolates were tested simultaneously by both KBDD method and agar dilution method. RESULTS: Very major errors were not observed with A. baumannii, A. lwoffii and P. aeruginosa, while other Pseudomonas spp. showed a very major error rate of about 5.6%. The major error rates observed with A. baumannii, A. lwoffii, P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp. were 1.8%, 0%, 2.1% and 28.6%, respectively. All the isolates showed a good correlation between zone diameters (KBDD method) and MICs (agar dilution method). The sensitivity and specificity of KBDD method for detecting meropenem resistance was above 90% for all the NFGNB except Pseudomonas spp. CONCLUSIONS: The KBDD method can be reliably used for routine testing of meropenem resistance in A. baumannii, A. lwoffii and P. aeruginosa. However, further studies are needed before employing this technique for detecting meropenem resistance in Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and cytotoxic effects of Magnolia dealbata and its active  compounds.
AB  - Multi-drug resistance is of great concern for public health worldwide and necessitates the search for new antimicrobials from sources such as plants. Several Magnolia (Magnoliaceae) species have been reported to exert antimicrobial effects on sensitive and multidrug-resistant microorganisms. However, the antimicrobial properties of Magnolia dealbata have not been experimentally evaluated. The antimicrobial effects of an ethanol extract of Magnolia dealbata seeds (MDE) and its active compounds honokiol (HK) and magnolol (MG) were tested against the phytopathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis and several human multi-drug resistant pathogens using the disk-diffusion assay. The effects of MDE and its active compounds on the viability of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were evaluated using MTT assay. MDE and its active compounds had antimicrobial activity (inhibition zone > 10 mm) against C. michiganensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Trichosporon belgeii. The results suggest that M. dealbata and its active compounds have selective antimicrobial effects against drug-resistant fungal and Gram (-) bacteria and exert minimal toxic effects on human PMBC.
TI  - Prevention of infections associated with combat-related extremity injuries.
AB  - During combat operations, extremities continue to be the most common sites of injury with associated high rates of infectious complications. Overall, approximately 15% of patients with extremity injuries develop osteomyelitis, and approximately 17% of those infections relapse or recur. The bacteria infecting these wounds have included multidrug-resistant bacteria such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The goals of extremity injury care are to prevent infection, promote fracture healing, and restore function. In this review, we use a systematic assessment of military and civilian extremity trauma data to provide evidence-based recommendations for the varying management strategies to care for combat-related extremity injuries to decrease infection rates. We emphasize postinjury antimicrobial therapy, debridement and irrigation, and surgical wound management including addressing ongoing areas of controversy and needed research. In addition, we address adjuvants that are increasingly being examined, including local antimicrobial therapy, flap closure, oxygen therapy, negative pressure wound therapy, and wound effluent characterization. This evidence-based medicine review was produced to support the Guidelines for the Prevention of Infections Associated With Combat-Related Injuries: 2011 Update contained in this supplement of Journal of Trauma.
TI  - Ancient antimicrobial peptides kill antibiotic-resistant pathogens: Australian mammals provide new options.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To overcome the increasing resistance of pathogens to existing antibiotics the 10x'20 Initiative declared the urgent need for a global commitment to develop 10 new antimicrobial drugs by the year 2020. Naturally occurring animal antibiotics are an obvious place to start. The recently sequenced genomes of mammals that are divergent from human and mouse, including the tammar wallaby and the platypus, provide an opportunity to discover novel antimicrobials. Marsupials and monotremes are ideal potential sources of new antimicrobials because they give birth to underdeveloped immunologically naive young that develop outside the sterile confines of a uterus in harsh pathogen-laden environments. While their adaptive immune system develops innate immune factors produced either by the mother or by the young must play a key role in protecting the immune-compromised young. In this study we focus on the cathelicidins, a key family of antimicrobial peptide genes. PRINCIPAL FINDING: We identified 14 cathelicidin genes in the tammar wallaby genome and 8 in the platypus genome. The tammar genes were expressed in the mammary gland during early lactation before the adaptive immune system of the young develops, as well as in the skin of the pouch young. Both platypus and tammar peptides were effective in killing a broad range of bacterial pathogens. One potent peptide, expressed in the early stages of tammar lactation, effectively killed multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Marsupial and monotreme young are protected by antimicrobial peptides that are potent, broad spectrum and salt resistant. The genomes of our distant relatives may hold the key for the development of novel drugs to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Colistin: recent data on pharmacodynamics properties and clinical efficacy in critically ill patients.
AB  - Recent clinical studies performed in a large number of patients showed that colistin "forgotten" for several decades revived for the management of infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and had acceptable effectiveness and considerably less toxicity than that reported in older publications. Colistin is a rapidly bactericidal antimicrobial agent that possesses a significant postantibiotic effect against MDR Gram-negative pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The optimal colistin dosing regimen against MDR GNB is still unknown in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. A better understanding of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of colistin is urgently needed to determine the optimal dosing regimen. Although pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in ICU patients are scarce, recent evidence shows that the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of colistimethate sodium and colistin in critically ill patients differ from those previously found in other groups, such as cystic fibrosis patients. The AUC:MIC ratio has been found to be the parameter best associated with colistin efficacy. To maximize the AUC:MIC ratio, higher doses of colistimethate sodium and alterations in the dosing intervals may be warranted in the ICU setting. In addition, the development of colistin resistance has been linked to inadequate colistin dosing. This enforces the importance of colistin dose optimization in critically ill patients. Although higher colistin doses seem to be beneficial, the lack of colistin pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data results in difficulty for the optimization of daily colistin dose. In conclusion, although colistin seems to be a very reliable alternative for the management of life-threatening nosocomial infections due to MDR GNB, it should be emphasized that there is a lack of guidelines regarding the ideal management of these infections and the appropriate colistin doses in critically ill patients with and without multiple organ failure.
TI  - Phosphate uptake performance of bacteria isolated from a full-scale Izmir municipal wastewater treatment plant.
AB  - This study investigated the phosphate uptake capacities of bacteria isolated from aerobic and anaerobic phosphate removal tanks at a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Izmir, Turkey, removing chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen (COD-N) and phosphorus (P) on a full-scale basis. Conventional plating techniques and an enrichment culture method were used to isolate the colonies, with a total of 91 monoculture isolates from the sludge samples being subjected to phosphate uptake studies. A total of 64 of these isolates had high phosphate uptake capacities ranging from 3.7 x 10(10) to 1.0 x 10(-12) mg PO4(3-) cell(-1), and only 11 of the strains with high phosphate uptake were Gram-negative. The highest phosphorus uptake value was 3.7 x 10(-10) mg PO4(-3) cell(-1), which was achieved by Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative strains were identified as Acinetobacter baumannii with a 99% probability and as Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a 96-98% probability (API 20 NE).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against gram-negative bacteria isolated from a tertiary hospital in Alexandria, Egypt.
AB  - The emergence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, has necessitated the search for alternative therapy by either introducing new agents or renewing interest in old agents. This study compares the in vitro activity of tigecycline (TIG), recently introduced to Egyptian market, to other potentially active antimicrobials as Colistin (COL), imipenem (IPM), levofloxacin (LEV), and piperacillin/tazobactam (PIP/TAZ) against 67 Gram-negative clinical isolates obtained from El- Meery Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. El-Meery Hospital is a 1,500-bed tertiary teaching hospital where TIG has not been previously used. Based on MIC(90)s, TIG was found to be a comparator to IPM and COL (MIC(90)= 8 mug/ml). LEV and PIP/TAZ were less active than TIG exhibiting high MIC(90)s. TIG inhibited 100% of Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae and 60% of Ps. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates. In time-kill studies against IPM-resistant isolates, TIG showed bactericidal activity after 6 hours of contact against the Enterobacteriaceae isolates and after 3 hours for the tested Ps. aeruginosa isolates at 4x and 8x MIC. Against A. baumannii, TIG exerted a bacteriostatic effect. TIG demonstrated variable ability to suppress biofilm formation affecting mainly E. coli and A. baumannii isolates. These results point TIG to be a promising agent in treatment of infections caused by strains for which adequate therapy has been limited. As far as we know, this is the first report evaluating the in vitro activity of TIG against Egyptian clinical isolates.
TI  - Metallo beta lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - This study aims in identifying MBLs particularly Zn requiring Molecular Class B enzymes produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii .The resistance by these organisms are in a rise against all antibiotics including carbapenems and no prescribed CLSI guidelines is available for detecting them. Clinical isolates antibiotic susceptibility was determined by number of phenotypic tests by addition of 50mM of 10 mul zinc as cofactor for metallo beta lactamase production along with 0.5M ETDA of 5 mul (930 mug per disk) plain disks. Increase in zone size of the meropenem -EDTA disk compared to the meropenem disk without EDTA was recorded positive. For Zn requiring MBLs zone towards both disks of EDTA and Zn along with meropenem is detected by DDST.
TI  - Polymyxins: Antimicrobial susceptibility concerns and therapeutic options.
AB  - The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae poses a great challenge to the treating physicians. The paucity of newer effective antimicrobials has led to renewed interest in the polymyxin group of drugs, as a last resort for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. There is a dearth of information on the pharmacological properties of colistin, leading to difficulties in selecting the right dose, dosing interval, and route of administration for treatment, especially in critically-ill patients. The increasing use of colistin over the last few years necessitates the need for accurate and reliable in vitro susceptibility testing methods. Development of heteroresistant strains as a result of colistin monotherapy is also a growing concern. There is a compelling need from the clinicians to provide options for probable and possible colistin combination therapy for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in the ICU setting. Newer combination drug synergy determination tests are being developed and reported. There are no standardized recommendations from antimicrobial susceptibility testing reference agencies for the testing and interpretation of these drug combinations. Comparison and analysis of these reported methodologies may help to understand and assist the microbiologist to choose the best method that produces accurate results at the earliest. This will help clinicians to select the appropriate combination therapy. In this era of multidrug resistance it is important for the microbiology laboratory to be prepared, by default, to provide timely synergistic susceptibility results in addition to routine susceptibility, if warranted. Not as a favour or at request, but as a responsibility.
TI  - Device-associated infection rates in 398 intensive care units in Shanghai, China: International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) findings.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine device-associated healthcare-associated infection (DA-HAI) rates and the microorganism profile in 398 intensive care units (ICUs) of 70 hospitals in Shanghai, China. METHODS: An open-label, prospective, cohort, active DA-HAI surveillance study was conducted on patients admitted to 398 tertiary-care ICUs in China from September 2004 to December 2009, implementing the methodology developed by the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC). The data were collected in the participating ICUs, and uploaded and analyzed at the INICC headquarters on proprietary software. DA-HAI rates were registered by applying the definitions of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). We analyzed the rates of DAI-HAI, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and their microorganism profiles. RESULTS: During the 5 years and 4 months of the study, 391 527 patients hospitalized in an ICU for an aggregate of 3,245,244 days, acquired 20,866 DA-HAIs, an overall rate of 5.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3-5.4) and 6.4 (95% CI 6.3-6.5) infections per 1000 ICU-days. VAP posed the greatest risk (20.8 per 1000 ventilator-days, 95% CI 20.4-21.1), followed by CAUTI (6.4 per 1000 catheter-days, 95% CI 6.3-6.6) and CLABSI (3.1 per 1000 catheter-days, 95% CI 3.0-3.2). The most common isolated microorganism was Acinetobacter baumannii (19.1%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (11.9%). CONCLUSIONS: DA-HAIs in the ICUs of Shanghai pose a far greater threat to patient safety than in ICUs in the USA. This is particularly the case for the VAP rate, which is much higher than the rates found in developed countries. Active infection control programs that carry out infection surveillance and implement prevention guidelines can improve patient safety and must become a priority.
TI  - Nosocomial infections in Tbilisi, Georgia: a retrospective study of microbiological data from 4 major tertiary care hospitals.
AB  
TI  - Outcomes and genetic relatedness of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae at Detroit medical center.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are rapidly emerging in hospitals in the United States and are posing a significant threat. To better understand the transmission dynamics and the acquisition of resistant strains, a thorough analysis of epidemiologic and molecular characteristics was performed. METHODS: CRE isolated at Detroit Medical Center were analyzed from September 2008 to September 2009. bla(KPC) genes were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) was used to determine genetic similarity among strains. Epidemiologic and outcomes analyses were performed. RESULTS: Ninety-two unique patient CRE isolates were recovered. Sixty-eight strains (74%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 were Klebsiella oxytoca, 15 were Enterobacter species, and 2 were Escherichia coli. Fifteen isolates (16%) were resistant to colistin, 14 (16%) were resistant to tigecycline, and 2 were resistant to all antimicrobials tested. The mean +/- standard deviation age of patients was 63 +/- 2 years. Sixty patients (68%) were admitted to the hospital from long-term care facilities. Only 70% of patients received effective antimicrobial therapy when infection was suspected, with a mean time to appropriate therapy of 120 +/- 23 hours following sample culturing. The mean length of hospitalization after sample culturing was 18.6 +/- 2.5 days. Of 57 inpatients, 18 (32%) died in the hospital. Independent predictors for mortality were intensive care unit stay (odds ratio [OR], 15.8; P = .003) and co-colonization with CRE and either Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR, 17.2; P = .006). Among K. pneumoniae CRE, rep-PCR revealed 2 genetically related strains that comprised 70% and 20% of isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this large U.S. cohort of patients with CRE infection, which reflects the modern continuum of medical care, co-colonization with CRE and A. baumannii or P. aeruginosa was associated with increased mortality. Two predominant clones of K. pneumoniae accounted for the majority of cases of CRE infection.
TI  - Surveillance and management of multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant organisms are an established and growing worldwide public health problem and few therapeutic options remain available. The traditional antimicrobials (glycopeptides) for multidrug-resistant Gram-positive infections are declining in efficacy. New drugs that are presently available are linezolid, daptomicin and tigecycline, which have well-defined indications for severe infections, and talavancin, which is under Phase III trial for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Unfortunately the therapies available for multidrug-resistant Gram-negatives, including carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae, are limited to only colistin and tigecycline. Both of these drugs are still not registered for severe infections, such as hospital acquired pneumonia. Consequently, as confirmed by scientific evidence, a multidisciplinary approach is needed. Surveillance, infection control procedures, isolation and antimicrobial stewardship should be implemented to reduce multidrug-resistant organism diffusion.
TI  - Incidence, risk stratification, antibiogram of pathogens isolated and clinical outcome of ventilator associated pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The initial empirical therapy of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) modified based on the knowledge of local microbiological data is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality. The objective was to find the incidence and risk factors associated with VAP, the implicated pathogens and their susceptibility pattern as well as to assess the final clinical outcome in VAP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of 107 patients taken on ventilatory support for two or more days and those not suffering from pneumonia prior were to be taken on ventilator. The study was done over a period of one year. VAP was diagnosed using clinical pulmonary infection score of >6. The mortality, incidence of VAP, frequency of different pathogens isolated, their antibiotic sensitivity pattern, duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of hospital stay were assessed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Univariate analysis, chi(2) test and paired t-test. RESULTS: The incidence of VAP was 28.04%. Mortality in VAP group was 46.67%, while in the non-VAP group was 27.28%. High APACHE II score was associated with a high mortality rate as well as increased incidence of VAP. The most common organisms isolated from endotracheal aspirate of patients who developed VAP were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. Most strains of Pseudomonas (55.56%) were resistant to commonly used beta-lactam antibiotics known to be effective against Pseudomonas. All strains of Staphylococcus aureus were MRSA and most isolates of K. pneumoniae (85.71%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing. About 50% isolates of Acinetobacter were resistant to carbapenems. Mortality was highest for infections caused by A. baumannii (83.33%) and K. pneumoniae (71.42%). CONCLUSIONS: APACHE II score can be used to stratify the risk of development of VAP and overall risk of mortality. Drug-resistant strains of various organisms are an important cause of VAP in our setting.
TI  - Controlled performance evaluation of the DiversiLab repetitive-sequence-based genotyping system for typing multidrug-resistant health care-associated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Fast, reliable, and versatile typing tools are essential to differentiate among related bacterial strains for epidemiological investigation and surveillance of health care-associated infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. The DiversiLab (DL) system is a semiautomated repetitive-sequence-based PCR system designed for rapid genotyping. The DL system performance was assessed by comparing its reproducibility, typeability, discriminatory power, and concordance with those of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and by assessing its epidemiological concordance on well-characterized MDR bacterial strains (n = 165). These included vanA Enterococcus faecium, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii, and ESBL- or metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The DL system showed very good performance for E. faecium and K. pneumoniae and good performance for other species, except for a discrimination index of <95% for A. baumannii and E. coli (93.9% and 93.5%, respectively) and incomplete concordance with MLST for P. aeruginosa (78.6%) and E. coli (97.0%). Occasional violations of MLST assignment by DL types were noted for E. coli. Complete epidemiological concordance was observed for all pathogens, as all outbreak-associated strains clustered in identical DL types that were distinct from those of unrelated strains. In conclusion, the DL system showed good to excellent performance, making it a reliable typing tool for investigation of outbreaks caused by study pathogens, even though it was generally less discriminating than PFGE analysis. For E. coli and P. aeruginosa, MLST cannot be reliably inferred from DL type due to phylogenetic group violation or discordance.
TI  - [Common antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in nosocomial infections in Taiwan and their prevention].
AB  - Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant strains (MDR) that cause difficulties in clinical treatment, have long been a problem of global concern. Drug-resistant strains of common nosocomial infections in Taiwan include Gram-positive coccal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Gram-negative bacilli such as carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, among others. About 10 to 20% of Gram-negative bacteria that encode extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are resistant to cephalosporin, a third generation antibiotic, and the fluoroquinolone-resistance rate has continued to increase in recent years. Despite the high mortality rate in patients with infections caused by MDR, the problem is still solvable by blocking or reducing MDR dissemination in addition to proper antibiotics use. Hand hygiene is the simplest, most effective measure for preventing nosocomial infections. However, healthcare workers' adherence to recommended hand hygiene practices is unacceptably low worldwide, making the promotion of hand hygiene a major challenge for infection control experts. Therefore, as a first step of preventing the spread of MDR bacteria, knowledge of hand hygiene and adherence to hand hygiene practices must be required of healthcare workers. Such should help reduce nosocomial infections significantly and upgrade healthcare quality.
TI  - Outcome of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa treated with aerosolized colistin in neonates: a retrospective chart review.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacteria-related nosocomial infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) presents an emerging challenge to clinicians. Older antimicrobial agents such as colistin have become life-saving drugs because of the susceptibility of these pathogens. We report our experience with aerosolized colistin in two preterm and one term neonate with Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-related VAP who were unresponsiveness to previous antimicrobial treatment. All pathogens were isolated from tracheal aspirate. We used 5 mg/kg (base activity) aerosolized colistin methanesulfonate sodium in every 12 h as an adjunctive therapy for VAP. VAP was treated by 14, 14, and 16-day courses of aerosolized colistin in these patients, respectively. No adverse effect such as nephrotoxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. We found that aerosolized colistin was tolerable and safe, and it may be an adjunctive treatment option for MDR gram-negative bacterial VAP in neonates. Further studies are needed to determine appropriate doses for aerosolized colistin and its eligibility as an alternative treatment choice in newborns.
TI  - Quantitative impact of neutrophils on bacterial clearance in a murine pneumonia model.
AB  - The rapid increase in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens is a global problem that has challenged our ability to treat serious infections. Currently, clinical decisions on treatment are often based on in vitro susceptibility data. The role of the immune system in combating bacterial infections is unequivocal, but it is not well captured quantitatively. In this study, the impact of neutrophils on bacterial clearance was quantitatively assessed in a murine pneumonia model. In vitro time-growth studies were performed to determine the growth rate constants of Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC BAA 747 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The absolute neutrophil count in mice resulting from different cyclophosphamide preparatory regimens was determined. The dynamic change of bacterial (A. baumannii BAA 747) burden in mice with graded immunosuppression over 24 h was captured by a mathematical model. The fit to the data was satisfactory (r(2) = 0.945). The best-fit maximal kill rate (K(k)) of the bacterial population by neutrophils was 1.743 h(-1), the number of neutrophils necessary for 50% maximal killing was 190.8/mul, and the maximal population size was 1.8 x 10(9) CFU/g, respectively. Using these model parameter estimates, the model predictions were subsequently validated by the bacterial burden change of P. aeruginosa PAO1 at 24 h. A simple mathematical model was proposed to quantify the contribution of neutrophils to bacterial clearance and predict the bacterial growth/suppression in animals. Our results provide a novel framework to link in vitro and in vivo information and may be used to improve clinical treatment of bacterial infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria obtained from intensive care units in a tertiary hospital in Beijing, China.
AB  - In this study we investigated the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria obtained from intensive care units (ICUs) in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) 309 Hospital located in beijing, China. between 2007 and 2010, a total of 1949 isolates of Gram-negative bacteria were collected and tested using an antibiotic susceptibility assay. A marked decrease was observed in the susceptibility of Acinetobacter baumannii to imipenem and amikacin as compared to that described in a previous report in China. Similar results were obtained for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, imipenem and amikacin showed strong activity against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Overall, the high rates of antimicrobial resistance against ICU pathogens in our hospital indicated a critical condition in Beijing, China. Development of a national control and monitoring system by the government may be an ideal method to solve the present problem of managing infections due to Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.
TI  - DNA capturing machinery through spore-displayed proteins.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to develop a general method for the facile development of a new DNA biosensor which utilizes streptavidin-displayed spores as a molecular machinery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fluorescence spectroscopy was used as a monitoring tool for the streptavidin displayed on the surface of Bacillus thuringiensis spores and as a diagnosis method for DNA detection. As a proof-of-concept, four pathogenic bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia were used for the detection of pathogenic species. In addition, a set of mutant variants of Wilson's disease were also used for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in this system. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy, utilizing streptavidin-displayed spores, is capable of capturing DNA targets for the detection of pathogenic bacteria and for mutation analysis in Wilson's disease. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This approach could be useful as a simple platform for developing sensitive spore-based biosensors for any desired DNA targets in diagnostic applications.
TI  - Outcomes in patients infected with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and treated with tigecycline alone or in combination therapy.
AB  - PURPOSE: Acinetobacter baumannii is a non-fermenting aerobic gram-negative bacteria and one of the important nosocomial pathogens, especially in intensive care units (ICUs). In recent years, multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates have been an emerging problem, with limited therapeutic options. Tigecycline is a novel antimicrobial, with its in vitro activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. METHODS: This is a retrospective study that was conducted in a tertiary care hospital with 550 beds in Ankara, Turkey, from January 2009 to July 2010. Thirty-three patients who had carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. infections and received tigecycline alone or in combination with other antibiotics for at least 3 days were included. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 62 (18-87) years. All of the patients were diagnosed and treated in the ICU. Clinical responses were observed in 23 patients (69.7%). Ten patients (30%) had clinical failure. There was no significant difference between ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream infection (BSI) in terms of clinical or microbiological outcome (p > 0.05). The microbiological response rate was 50%. Superinfection was detected in 13 patients (43.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen. The 30-day overall mortality rate and attributable mortality rates were 57.6 and 24.2%, respectively. The attributable mortality rate was higher in the group in which microbiological eradication was not provided. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, emerged resistance of Acinetobacter spp. and limited therapeutic options left physicians no choice but to use tigecycline for off-label indications.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Longitudinal survey of carbapenem resistance and resistance mechanisms in Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters from the USA in 2007-09.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance is problematic in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, and is often associated with serious infections. Carbapenems are often one of the few remaining therapeutic options, so it is important to monitor carbapenem activity against these pathogens and to identify resistance mechanisms. METHODS: Carbapenem susceptibilities were determined for 14 359 Enterobacteriaceae, 3614 P. aeruginosa and 994 A. baumannii from the USA (2007-09). Klebsiella pneumoniae with doripenem MICs >/=2 mg/L (n = 88), and P. aeruginosa (n = 452), A. baumannii (n = 349) and other enterics (n = 13) with doripenem MICs >/=4 mg/L were screened for carbapenem resistance mechanisms. RESULTS: Doripenem/meropenem and imipenem susceptibilities for Enterobacteriaceae were >99% and 89%, respectively. Doripenem susceptibility (2007-09) for P. aeruginosa was 87.4%-84.1%; comparable to meropenem and higher than imipenem. For A. baumannii, doripenem susceptibility (2007-09) was 63%-58.2%; lower than imipenem and meropenem. Resistant K. pneumoniae had KPC and lacked porins OmpK35/OmpK36. In 2009, 3.4% of all K. pneumoniae possessed KPC. Five other enterics and one P. aeruginosa possessed KPC. Resistance mechanisms in P. aeruginosa were loss of porin OprD (90%), efflux (55%) and elevated AmpC activity (25%). Acquired carbapenemases OXA-23/-24 were present in 48% of resistant A. baumannii. VIM metallo-beta-lactamases were present in three P. aeruginosa and one A. baumannii isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Doripenem and meropenem were more active than imipenem against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa from the USA. Carbapenem resistance mechanisms included serine carbapenemases, elevated AmpC activity, efflux and porin deficiencies occurring mostly in P. aeruginosa. Metallo-beta-lactamases were found in <0.1% of isolates.
TI  - [Evolution of susceptibility to antibiotics of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii, in a University Hospital Center of Beirut between 2005 and 2009].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Until recently, multiresistant bacteria were only limited to hospitals. However, they are now responsible for community acquired infections, affecting people who have had no contact with the hospital environment. Several mechanisms are associated with these resistances. The production of betalactamases is however the predominant mechanism and especially the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases or ESBL by strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which mediate resistance to third generation cephalosporins and aztreonam (AZT). The association of multiple mechanisms of resistance (efflux pumps, impermeability and enzymatic inactivation) generates multi resistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa MDR and Klebsiella pneumoniae MDR. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to analyze retrospectively the susceptibility to antibiotics of strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumanii isolated from hospitalized and outpatients in a university hospital center of Beirut over a period of five years from 2005 to 2009. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial strains were classified according to their origin (inpatients versus outpatients), their ability to produce or not ESBLs for E. coli and K. pneumonia and if they were MDR for P. aeruginosa and A. baumanii. Antibiotics susceptibilities were retrieved from the informatics database of the hospital. Comparison of susceptibility percentages was done using a unilateral z-test on a computer program. RESULTS: In 2009, 2541 strains of E. coli were isolated, 773 of which or 30.4 % were ESBL producers while 2031 strains were isolated in 2005, of which 361 or 17.8 % were ESBL producers (p<0.001). We noticed a decrease in hospital strains susceptibility to ceftazidime (CAZ) and AZT, between 2005 and 2009 (p<0.001), and a decrease in community strains susceptibility to trimethoprime/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) between 2005 and 2009 (p=0.03). We noted however a significant decrease of ESBL producing strains between 2007 and 2009: 33.4 % versus 30.4 % (p=0.03). Among 560 strains of K. pneumoniae isolated in 2009, 178 strains or 31.8 % were ESBL producers in comparison to 23.7 % of the strains isolated in 2005 (p=0.03). We also noticed a decrease in hospital strains susceptibility to piperacilline-tazobactam (TZP), cefotaxime (CTX) and AZT (p<0.001 p=0.03 and p=0.03 respectively) between 2006 and 2009, and a significant increase in ESBL producing strains between 2008 et 2009 (p=0.0001). 26.5 % of P. aeruginosa strains isolated in 2009 were MDR bacteria with no significant change as compared to 26.6 % in 2005 (p=0.5). However, the percentage of MDR strains slightly decreased between 2008 and 2009 (p=0.047). The susceptibility of MDR strains to CAZ and imipenem (IMP) decreased between 2005 and 2009 (p<0.001 and P=0.003 respectively). As for A. baumanii, 77.7 % of strains were MDR in 2009 in comparison to 73.4 % in 2005 (p=0.24) with a dramatic decrease of MDR strains susceptibility to IMP from 92.3 % in 2006 to 30 % in 2009 (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite restrictions on antibiotics prescriptions and isolation of patients harboring MDR bacteria or bacteria producing ESBL, there has not been satisfactory reduction of multi resistant bacteria and efforts should be made to reduce these bugs from the hospital flora.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance of Gram negative bacilli isolated from tertiary-care hospitals in Colombia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance has been identified as one of the major public health problems worldwide. To facilitate its control, bacterial resistance levels must be monitored permanently by effective surveillance systems. OBJECTIVE: To describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns of Gram negative bacilli in Colombian hospitals over a 3-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive study used the bacterial susceptibility profiles provided by 14 tertiary-care hospitals belonging to the Colombian Nosocomial Resistance Study Group. The hospitals were located in 7 major cities in Colombia, and provided records over the period January 2006 to December 2008. Using WHONET 5.4, the antimicrobial resistance patterns were described for the Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenters (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). Comparisons were made in the bacterial responses to selected antibiotics in samples from general wards and from adult intensive care units. RESULTS: The antimicrobial resistance frequencies of several Enterobacteriaceae species showed a decreasing trend. In contrast, P. aeruginosa was demonstrated to be a multidrug-resistance organism with increasing resistance frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: These data emphasize the importance of surveillance programs in detecting presence of multidrug-resistant organisms. This information will aid the implementation of protocols aimed to strengthen the infection control strategies and antibiotic stewardship in each hospital.
TI  - Evaluations of bacterial contaminated full thickness burn wound healing in Sprague Dawley rats Treated with Tualang honey.
AB  - AIM: The effect of Tualang honey on wound healing in bacterial contaminated full-thickness burn wounds was evaluated in 36 male Sprague Dawley rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 12/group). Three full-thickness burn wounds were created on each rat. Each group of rats was inoculated with a different organism in the burn wounds: Group A was inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Group B was inoculated with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Group C was inoculated with Acinetobacter baumannii. One wound on each rat was dressed with either Tualang honey, Chitosan gel or Hydrofibre silver. Each wound size was measured on day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 of the study. RESULTS: The mean wound size of the Tualang honey-treated wounds was not statistically different than that of the Chitosan gel or Hydrofibre silver-treated wounds when the wounds were compared throughout the entire experiment (P > 0.05). However, comparing the mean wound size on day 21 alone revealed that the Tualang honey-treated wounds were smaller in comparison to that of the Chitosan gel and Hydrofibre silver-treated groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that topical application of Tualang honey on burn wounds contaminated with P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii gave the fastest rate of healing compared with other treatments.

TI  - The challenges of antimicrobial drug resistance in Greece.
AB  - Antimicrobial drug resistance rates in Greece are among the highest in Europe. The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative species has increased considerably, including endemic strains in intensive care units. Pandrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are sporadically reported. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus rates are also high in Greek hospitals. Multidrug resistance increases risk of mortality, hospitalization duration and costs, and undermines the medical system. Administrative responses initiated include action plans, monitoring systems, and guidelines. Common terminology among involved parties for defining and grading resistance is required. Multidrug-resistant microorganisms challenge clinical laboratories; uniform recommendations towards detection of resistance mechanisms need to be established. Prospective multicenter outcome studies comparing antibiotic regimens and containment methods are needed. Because new antimicrobials against Gram-negative pathogens are not foreseeable, judicious use of the existing and strict adherence to infection control best practice might restrain resistance spread. Awareness of resistance patterns and organisms prevailing locally by reporting laboratories and treating physicians is important.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  - We studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. Species studied included 3 common species of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. MICs and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria for urinary tract isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria for Enterobacteriaceae. Tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by CLSI or EUCAST. Escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. A. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of MIC breakpoint. New tentative zone diameter criteria for K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. aureus, and E. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by CLSI and EUCAST.
TI  - The role played by contaminated surfaces in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - Studies in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that environmental surface contamination played a negligible role in the endemic transmission of healthcare-associated infections. However, recent studies have demonstrated that several major nosocomial pathogens are shed by patients and contaminate hospital surfaces at concentrations sufficient for transmission, survive for extended periods, persist despite attempts to disinfect or remove them, and can be transferred to the hands of healthcare workers. Evidence is accumulating that contaminated surfaces make an important contribution to the epidemic and endemic transmission of Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and norovirus and that improved environmental decontamination contributes to the control of outbreaks. Efforts to improve environmental hygiene should include enhancing the efficacy of cleaning and disinfection and reducing the shedding of pathogens. Further high-quality studies are needed to clarify the role played by surfaces in nosocomial transmission and to determine the effectiveness of different interventions in reducing associated infection rates.
TI  - Thiophenyl oxime-derived phosphonates as nano-molar class C beta-lactamase inhibitors reducing MIC of imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The preparation and characterization of a series of thiophenyl oxime phosphonate  beta-lactamase inhibitors is described. A number of these analogs were potent and selective inhibitors of class C beta-lactamases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. Compounds 3b and 7 reduced the MIC of imipenem against an AmpC expressing strain of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa. A number of the title compounds retained micromolar potency against the class D OXA-40 beta-lactamase from Acinetobacter baumannii and at high concentrations compound 3b was shown to reduce the MIC of imipenem against a highly imipenem-resistant strain of A. baumanii expressing the OXA-40 beta-lactamase. In mice compound 3b exhibited phamacokinetics similar to imipenem.
TI  - Effect of antibiotic diversity on ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by ESKAPE Organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to test in the clinic whether antimicrobial diversity affects resistance of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella species, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: Three different strategies of empirical antimicrobial prescription for VAP were consecutively implemented in an ICU: patient specific (10 months); scheduling, including sequential quarterly prioritization (12 months) and restriction (12 months) of antimicrobials; and mixing (10 months). Periods were compared, measuring the antimicrobial heterogeneity index (AHI). Incidence and resistance patterns of VAP caused by ESKAPE were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 127 microbiologic VAP episodes were documented. ESKAPE VAP increased significantly during scheduling (AHI, 0.65) compared with patient-specific (AHI, 0.88) and mixing (AHI, 0.87) periods (relative risk, 2.67 and 3.84, respectively). This finding was associated with a significant (P < .05) increase of carbapenem-resistant A baumannii during the scheduling period (15.0%) compared with the patient-specific (2.4%) and mixing (0%) periods. ICU mortality of resistant patients with ESKAPE VAP was doubled that of patients without ESKAPE VAP (relative risk, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.67-9.48). Thirty-day mechanical ventilation-free days was significantly increased (5 days) in patients with resistant ESKAPE VAP. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic strategies promoting diversity may prevent the emergence of resistance of ESKAPE organisms, improving use of health-care resources.
TI  - Optimizing ciprofloxacin dosing in intensive care unit patients through the use of population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis and Monte Carlo simulations.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore different ciprofloxacin dosage regimens for the treatment  of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with respect to clinical outcome and the development of bacterial resistance for the major Gram-negative pathogens. METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic model was first developed on ciprofloxacin serum concentrations obtained in 102 ICU patients. Then, based on this model, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs) were carried out to explore the appropriateness of different ciprofloxacin dosage regimens in ICU patients. The defined targets were free AUC(24)/MIC >/=90 h (as a predictor of clinical outcome) and T(MSW) </=20% (as a predictor of selecting resistance), where T(MSW) is the time spent within the mutant selection window over 24 h. Two simulation trials were conducted: Trial 1 took into account the whole MIC distribution for each causative pathogen in line with empirical antibiotherapy; Trial 2 used MIC breakpoints given by the Antibiogram Committee of the French Microbiology Society in order to treat the 'worst-case' scenario. RESULTS: Trial 1 showed that for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, the common dosage regimens of 400 mg twice or three times a day did not achieve the desired target attainment rates (TARs) with respect to T(MSW), while suboptimal TARs were found for AUC(24)/MIC. Trial 2 showed that </= 18% of patients reached the target of T(MSW) </= 20% for MIC breakpoints of 0.5 and 1 mg/L, regardless of the administered dose. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the mutant selection window concept, our simulations truly question the use of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii infections in ICU patients due to the potential for developing resistance.
TI  - [Analysis of the drug-resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the use of antibiotics in burn wards].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study changes in the drug-resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and the use of antibiotics in burn wards so as to optimize the use of antibiotic in the future. METHODS: Bacteria were isolated from specimens of blood, venous catheter, stool, sputum, urine, wound tissue from 5717 patients hospitalized in our burn wards within the duration of January 2005 to December 2009. The number of specimens examined and positive rates of bacteria were calculated. Changes in constituent ratio of cocci and bacilli, spectrum of bacteria, the drug-resistance rate of PA, and the usage of antibiotics were analyzed. The number of specimens examined, constituent ratio of cocci and bacilli, drug-resistance rate were processed with chi-square test. Bivariate correlation analysis was performed between the usage of antibiotics and the drug-resistance rate. RESULTS: (1) The number of specimens examined showed no statistical difference during the five years (with rates from 73.2% to 76.1%, chi(2) = 5.583, P > 0.05), while constituent ratio of cocci and bacilli showed statistical difference (with ratios from 105:134 to 169:126, chi(2) = 14.806, P < 0.01). The positive rates of bacteria were increasing in the five years. (2) One thousand six hundred and seventy-five strains were identified during the five years from different kinds of specimens, with 29 from blood, 39 from venous catheter, 3 from stool, 157 from sputum, 13 from urine, and 1434 from wound tissue. Among them, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 28% to 42%, PA accounted for 10% to 25%, Acinetobacter baumannii accounted for 10% to 19%, and they were the predominant strains. (3) The difference among drug-resistance rates of PA to each kind of 12 antibiotics during the five years were statistically significant (with chi(2) values from 47.911 to 308.095, P values all below 0.01). The drug-resistance rates of PA to some antibiotics showed downward trend in the former four years, including amikacin, ceftazidime, and imipenem/cilastatin, but it rebounded in the fifth year. (4) There was descending trend in usage of cefoperazone/sulbactam and levofloxacin, but vancomycin was always used widely. (5) Drug-resistance rates of PA to 7 antibiotics, including amikacin, imipenem/cilastatin, and ciprofloxacin, etc., were positively correlated with usage of various antibiotics (with r values from 0.879 to 0.978, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In our burn wards, drug-resistant PA was prevalent. Disinfection and isolation measures, appropriate use of antibiotics, etc. can reduce PA infection.
TI  - Bacteriological differences between COPD exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the differences in pathogen distribution and antibiotic susceptibility between patients with COPD exacerbation and patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and develop guidance for antibiotic treatment of those conditions. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 586 COPD-exacerbation patients and 345 community-acquired-pneumonia patients from January 2007 to December 2008, including sputum culture results, antibiotic susceptibilities of the microorganisms, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 276 (47%) of the COPD-exacerbation patients, and 183 (53%) of the community-acquired-pneumonia patients had a positive sputum culture. In order, the most common pathogens in the COPD-exacerbation patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Haemophilus influenzae. The most common pathogens in the community-acquired-pneumonia patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa was the most common pathogen in our patients with COPD exacerbation, and S. pneumoniae was the most common in our patients with community-acquired pneumonia. P. aeruginosa is especially common in the patients with serious or extremely serious COPD.
TI  - Simultaneous detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by multiplex PCR.
AB  - A PCR-based assay that can simultaneously detect and differentiate five different types of nosocomial bacterial pathogens was developed. Six pairs of selected primers targeting femA (132 bp) and mecA (310 bp) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, gltA (722 bp) of Acinetobacter baumannii, phoA (903 bp) of Escherichia coli, mdh (364 bp) of Klebsiella pneumoniae and oprL (504 bp) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used in this study. The conditions were optimized for the multiplex PCR to ensure specific amplification of the selected targets. Sensitivity and specificity tests were also carried out using a blind test approach on 50 bacterial cultures and resulted in 100% for both positive and negative predictive values.
TI  - Trend analysis of antimicrobial consumption and development of resistance in non-fermenters in a tertiary care hospital in Delhi, India.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are becoming increasingly important nosocomial pathogens worldwide. To study the evolution of non-fermenters in a tertiary care hospital, we undertook a retrospective 10 year (1999-2008) trend analysis of antimicrobial consumption and resistance in non-fermenters causing bacteraemia. METHODS: Antibiotic consumption and resistance were analysed by linear regression. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used for assessing correlation between them. RESULTS: A total of 69,010 blood cultures were performed, which grew 15,465 isolates (22% positivity rate), of which 1525 isolates (771 isolates of P. aeruginosa and 754 isolates of A. baumannii) were non-fermenters. Overall antibiotic consumption showed an increasing trend, from 158 to 319 defined daily doses (DDDs)/100 bed-days (r(2)= 0.62, P = 0.007). The largest relative increase in antibiotic consumption was seen for carbapenems (r(2)= 0.68, P = 0.022), followed by beta-lactam/inhibitor combinations (r(2 )= 0.45, P = 0.033), whereas third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides showed no significant changes. A significant increase in resistance in A. baumannii to fluoroquinolones (r(2 )= 0.63, P = 0.006), aminoglycosides (r(2 )= 0.63, P = 0.011) and carbapenems (r(2 )= 0.82, P = 0.013) and in P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides (r(2 )= 0.59, P = 0.01) was observed. Carbapenem consumption was associated with the development of resistance in A. baumannii (r = 0.756, P = 0.049), whereas no such association was observed for other antimicrobials among non-fermenters. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the growing problem of high antimicrobial consumption. The increasing prevalence of non-fermenters and the emergence of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii are associated with the consumption of carbapenems. The data cannot prove cause and effect.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  - The rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. We have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (NO-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. Although the prior findings suggest that the NO-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of NO-np has yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a NO-np against several Gram-positive and -negative clinical isolates. We found that the NO-np were uniformly active against all of the Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. We concluded that the NO-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Analysis of multilocus sequence typing schemes for 35 different bacteria revealed that gene loci of 10 bacteria could be replaced to improve cost-effectiveness.
AB  - Although multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has been widely used for bacterial typing, the contribution of the gene loci to the discriminatory power of each MLST scheme is unknown. We analyzed the discriminatory powers of 36 MLST schemes using all combinations of the 7 loci and contributions of each locus to the schemes. In 10 schemes, sequencing 6 loci can achieve the discriminatory powers of 7 loci. For the other 26 schemes, the median marginal increase in discriminatory power when 7 instead of 6 loci were used is 0.0004. Sequencing the 7 loci of 50 strains each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii revealed that the discriminatory power for P. aeruginosa was 0.9861 when either 6 (without trp) or 7 loci were used and that for A. baumannii was 0.9363 when 5, 6, or 7 loci were used. Genes that have no additional or minimal contribution to the overall discriminatory powers should be replaced.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing on burn wound isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver alginate dressing  on opportunistic pathogens, namely meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Chryseobacterium indologenes, Proteus vulgaris and Acinetobacter baumannii. METHOD: In total, 40 microorganisms were isolated from patients attending three burn centres in the US and evaluated for their susceptibility to a silver alginate wound dressing, employing a corrected zone of inhibition assay, conducted on Mueller Hinton agar (MHA). RESULTS: The sizes of the corrected zones of inhibition varied between and within genera. For example, all Acinetobacter baumannii strains were found to be sensitive to ionic silver at pH 7, with a mean of 2.8mm, compared with 3.5mm at pH 5.5. The silver alginate dressing also demonstrated activity on all strains of Enterobacter and Escherichia coli, with susceptibility to the silver alginate dressing enhanced at pH 5.5. For Enterococcus spp. the average corrected zone of inhibition at pH 7 was 3.6mm, versus 4.9mm at pH 5.5. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing. The average corrected zone of inhibition was 6.9mm at pH 7, compared with 8mm at pH 5.5. For MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus, it ranged from 4.5mm to 7.5mm at pH 7. When the pH was decreased to 5.5, the corrected zone of inhibition increased. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the activity of a silver alginate dressing on a wide range of burn isolates, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolated from three different burn centres in the US. It also highlights the possible importance of pH and its potential effects on antimicrobial performance and microbial susceptibility. However, more extensive testing is required to substantiate this. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: SLP is employed by Advanced Medical Solutions Ltd.
TI  - Therapeutic effectiveness of a generic versus original meropenem in serious infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meropenem plays a significant role in the current antimicrobial treatment of serious infections. Recently, generic meropenems have become widely available in Thailand. OBJECTIVE: Compare the effectiveness and safety ofa generic meropenem (Mapenem) with the original meropenem (Meronem) in clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in hospitalized patients with serious infections that had been treated with either the generic or the original meropenem in nine secondary- and tertiary-care hospitals nationwide. The treatment outcomes at days 3, 7, and 14 after the use ofmeropenem between the two groups were compared. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety seven patients with a mean (SD) age of 66.4 +/- 16.9 years were included. There were 228 (57.4%) males and 169 (42.6%) females. Two hundred and seven (52.1%) and 190 (47.9%) cases fell into the generic and original groups respectively. There were no significant differences regarding age, gender history of underlying disease, body weight, and ward of admission between the two groups. The majority ofpatients had presented with the respiratory tract (48.6%) and bloodstream infections (29.5%). The three most common causative bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli. The distribution ofthe sites of infection, causative microorganisms, the dosage ofmeropenem, and duration oftreatment were similar between the two groups. The distribution of patients with complete resolution, improvement, stable, worse, diedfrom infection, and died from other causes were similar between the two groups at day 3, 7, and 14 ofmeropenem use (p > 0.05). The drugs were well-tolerated, and less than 2% of patients in both groups discontinued meropenem due to the adverse drug effects. CONCLUSION: The generic meropenem has a similar effectiveness in the treatment of serious bacterial infections when compared with original meropenem. Both formulations are well tolerated among patients with substantial comorbidities. Adverse drug effects that lead to drug discontinuation are uncommon.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamases: a last frontier for beta-lactams?
AB  - Metallo-beta-lactamases are resistance determinants of increasing clinical relevance in Gram-negative bacteria. Because of their broad range, potent carbapenemase activity and resistance to inhibitors, these enzymes can confer resistance to almost all beta-lactams. Since the 1990s, several metallo-beta-lactamases encoded by mobile DNA have emerged in important Gram-negative pathogens (ie, in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii). Some of these enzymes (eg, VIM-1 and NDM-1) have been involved in the recent crisis resulting from the international dissemination of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and other enterobacteria. Although substantial knowledge about the molecular biology and genetics of metallo-beta-lactamases is available, epidemiological data are inconsistent and clinical experience is still lacking; therefore, several unsolved or debatable issues remain about the management of infections caused by producers of metallo-beta-lactamase. The spread of metallo-beta-lactamases presents a major challenge both for treatment of individual patients and for policies of infection control, exposing the substantial unpreparedness of public health structures in facing up to this emergency.
TI  - Microbial isolation and emergence of antimicrobial resistance associated with tigecycline usage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing experience of tigecycline usage, its ecological impact on microorganisms raises concerns but remains unknown. We aimed to analyze the difference in microorganisms isolated before, during, and after tigecycline usage and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Between July 2008 and August 2009, 66 patients who received tigecycline monotherapy for more than 2 days at a Taiwan medical center were enrolled. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution method with VITEK-2 system and was analyzed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, except for tigecycline. We followed USA Food and Drug Administration criteria for interpretation of susceptibility to tigecycline. RESULTS: The median duration of tigecycline monotherapy was 13.4 days. After tigecycline treatment, the isolation frequency of Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased, but that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia did not change. A baumannii and P aeruginosa were the two most common pathogens when tigecycline was administered. The tigecycline susceptibility rate of A baumannii isolates decreased after the administration of tigecycline. CONCLUSION: The most common pathogens isolated in patients receiving tigecycline were A baumannii and P aeruginosa. Tigecycline usage decreased the isolation frequency of A baumannii, methicillin-resistant S aureus, E coli, and K pneumoniae. Exposure to tigecycline may be associated with a decreased susceptibility rate of A baumannii for tigecycline.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care units in Hubei Province, China: a multicentre prospective cohort survey.
AB  - A multicentre prospective cohort study was performed in 17 intensive care units (ICUs) in tertiary care hospitals in Hubei Province, China. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was defined according to modified criteria from the published literature. Among 4155 ventilated patients, the crude incidence and incidence rate of VAP were 20.9% and 28.9 cases per 1000 ventilator-days. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression revealed risk factors including male sex [risk ratio (RR): 1.5; P<0.001], coma (RR: 2.1; P<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR: 1.4; P<0.001), infections at other sites (RR: 1.6; P=0.001), serious disease predating the onset of VAP (RR: 1.6; P<0.001) and interventions including antacid treatment (RR: 1.4; P<0.001), antimicrobial treatment (RR: 5.1; P<0.001), bronchoscopy (RR: 1.5; P=0.041) and tracheostomy (RR: 1.4; P=0.014). The most frequently isolated causative pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 45.7% were meticillin resistant. Rates, risk factors and causal pathogens of VAP in ICUs in Hubei differ from those reported from developed countries. These data show the need for more effective infection control interventions in Hubei, China.
TI  - New treatment options for infections caused by multiresistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Hospital-acquired infections are one of the most important challenges to patient  safety, especially in critical care units. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics results frequently in multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, we are attending to increased rates of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, especially gram-negative bacilli, that have been associated with prolonged hospital stays, higher costs, and increased mortality. The most important multidrug-resistant pathogens are PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA and ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII. There has been an important but as yet unsuccessful effort to develop new drugs to treat these pathogens. Nevertheless, old, very well known drugs, such as polymyxins, administered intravenously and aerosolized, have been revisited. Future options include immunotherapy or the continuous infusion of antibiotics. It is also important to emphasize the rational use of antibiotics to diminish the appearance of multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Synergistic combination of chitosan acetate with nanoparticle silver as a topical antimicrobial: efficacy against bacterial burn infections.
AB  - Chitosan and nanoparticle silver are both materials with demonstrated antimicrobial properties and have been proposed singly or in combination as constituents of antimicrobial burn dressings. Here, we show that they combine synergistically to inhibit the in vitro growth of Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter baumannii), as judged by bioluminescence monitoring and isobolographic analysis, and also produce synergistic killing after 30 min of incubation, as measured by a CFU assay. The hypothesized explanation involves chitosan-mediated permeabilization of bacterial cells, allowing better penetration of silver ions into the cell. A dressing composed of freeze-dried chitosan acetate incorporating nanoparticle silver was compared with a dressing of chitosan acetate alone in an in vivo burn model infected with bioluminescent P. aeruginosa. The survival rates of mice treated with silver-chitosan or regular chitosan or left untreated were 64.3% (P = 0.0082 versus regular chitosan and P = 0.0003 versus the control), 21.4%, and 0%, respectively. Most of the fatalities occurred between 2 and 5 days postinfection. Silver-chitosan dressings effectively controlled the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. These data suggest that a dressing combining chitosan acetate with silver leads to improved antimicrobial efficacy against fatal burn infections.
TI  - Risk factors and pathogen profile of ventilator-associated pneumonia in a neonatal intensive care unit in China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to explore the incidence and risk factors of, and summarize the involved pathogens in, neonates with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the authors' neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to determine the effective strategies for prevention. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study including 117 VAP patients and 232 controls was conducted from January 2002 to July 2008. The antibiotics sensitivity spectrum was determined on quantitative microbiological evaluation. Multiple logistic regression and Cox model analysis were performed to determine independent and accumulative risk factors for VAP. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that birthweight, mechanical ventilation (MV), parenteral alimentation, dexamethasone and other respiratory disease were associated with the development of VAP. The cumulative risk for developing VAP increased over the duration of stay in the NICU. The most common isolated bacteria of the pathogen spectrum in VAP were Klebsiella spp. (33/146), Acinetobacter baumannii (26/146), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18/146) and Staphylococcus aureus(13/146). Meanwhile, we found that previous use of antibiotics before VAP diagnosis was not associated with the onset of VAP. CONCLUSIONS: The daily risk for VAP increases with duration of stay in the NICU after ventilation. Drug-resistant bacteria are common pathogens for neonatal VAP in the authors' NICU.
TI  - [The microbiology laboratory's contribution to the surveillance and control of outbreaks caused by nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  are, among others, the most important nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli within hospitals. These organisms are able to cause different types of nosocomial infections in predisposed patients, and P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii in particular may cause extensive clonal outbreaks and complex situations in which sporadic isolates may coexist with some epidemic strains. Some common features are their intrinsic resistance to many antimicrobials, their capacity to further develop antimicrobial resistance, and the possibility of environmental reservoirs as sources of these microorganisms in healthcare centers. The microbiology laboratory plays a key role in the detection of potential outbreaks, in the identification of new resistance mechanisms and in the characterization of local epidemiology, by detecting colonized patients and/or environmental reservoirs if needed, appropriately identifying the isolates, phenotypically or genotypically characterizing their mechanisms of resistance, if appropriate, and finally by using different molecular techniques for clonal typing, which are reviewed in this article. Such activities must be performed in the context of the surveillance and control programs of specific institutions and as part of the daily work of multidisciplinary infection control teams.
TI  - [Bacterial epidemiology in the burns unit at military teaching hospital Mohamed V of Rabat].
AB  - We aimed to establish the ecology of the Burns Unit of the Military Teaching Hospital Mohammed V of Rabat. We present results of a retrospective study of four years (March 2006-June 2010) on all micro-organisms isolated from patient samples. During the study period, we analyzed 307 samples corresponding to isolate bacterial strains from 288 non-redundant and 5 yeasts among which 4 corresponded to Candida albicans. The bacteriological profile of the isolated stumps showed a change between 2006 and 2010. Staphylococcus aureus in 2007 and 2008 (52.3%, 33.9%) was in 3rd position in 2010 (10.5%). Acinetobacter baumannii found in 3rd position or below (3.7%, 11.6%, 15.3%), between 2006 and 2008, reached the summit in 2009 and 2010 (22.6% and 23.7%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strain dominant in 2006 (33.3%) maintained its second position in 2007, 2008 and 2010 (19.8%, 18.6%, 18.4%) while it was third in 2009 (14.3%). Study of the resistance in antibiotics of the main isolated bacteria showed a stability of the profile of resistance. In conclusion, an epidemiological surveillance of bacteria is necessary, in the burns unit and in the hospital, to guide better the probability antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Causative pathogen dictates optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia in trauma patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) guidelines recommend considering abbreviated therapy in patients with non-Pseudomonas aeruginosa VAP if clinical signs resolve. However, using an arbitrary day cutoff or clinical signs can be suboptimal for some, especially multiply injured patients, resulting in relapse and/or antibiotic resistance. Previously, we showed that repeat bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) could guide antimicrobial duration for community-acquired VAP in trauma patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate duration of antimicrobial therapy for VAP in trauma patients secondary to hospital-acquired pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: Patients with VAP secondary to MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SM), or Enterobacteriaceae (ENB) during 6 years were evaluated. All received empiric antimicrobial therapy based on duration of ICU stay. Therapy was tailored based on culture data. Repeat BAL was performed on day 4 of appropriate therapy. Microbiological resolution was defined as </=10(3) colony-forming units/mL. Recurrence was defined as >/=10(5) colony-forming units/mL on subsequent BAL performed within 2 weeks after completion of appropriate therapy. RESULTS: Six hundred and fifty-nine patients were identified. Seventy-seven percent of patients underwent repeat BAL: 96 with MRSA, 100 with AB, 139 with PA, 50 with SM, and 120 with ENB. The majority of patients with MRSA or PA achieved microbiological resolution after 14 days. Nearly 60% of patients with AB, SM, or ENB achieved microbiological resolution after 10 days. Overall recurrence was 2%. CONCLUSIONS: Repeat BAL provides objective evidence for VAP resolution in the face of potentially confounding clinical factors. Hospital-acquired VAP can be managed effectively by a defined course of therapy with a low recurrence. Duration of antimicrobial therapy for VAP in trauma patients should be dictated by the causative pathogen.

TI  - Detection of the KPC gene in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii during a PCR-based nosocomial surveillance study in Puerto Rico.
AB  - A 6-month, PCR-based, island-wide hospital surveillance study of beta-lactam resistance in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii was conducted in Puerto Rico. Of 10,507 isolates, 1,239 (12%) unique, multi-beta-lactam-resistant isolates from all geographical regions were identified. The KPC gene was detected in 61 E. coli, 333 K. pneumoniae, 99 P. aeruginosa, and 41 A. baumannii isolates, indicating the widespread dissemination of the KPC gene in clinically significant nosocomial isolates.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Emergence of NDM-1-producing Acinetobacter baumannii in China.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of bla(NDM-1) in Gram-negative bacilli  in China. METHODS: A total of 11 298 clinical Gram-negative bacilli, covering Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were collected for PCR-based surveillance of bla(NDM-1) from 57 hospitals representing 18 provinces in China. For bla(NDM-1)-positive isolates, antibiotic susceptibilities were assessed and molecular typing was performed using PFGE. The genetic location of bla(NDM-1) was determined by analysis of PFGE profiles of S1 nuclease-digested genomic DNA and Southern blot hybridization. Plasmid transfer to E. coli recipients was investigated using filter mating and electroporation. RESULTS: Four A. baumannii isolates with bla(NDM-1) were identified in four different provinces in China: no positive isolates were detected among E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. These bla(NDM-1)-positive A. baumannii were resistant to all carbapenems and cephalosporins, and three remained susceptible to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and colistin. The four NDM-1-producing A. baumannii were clonally diverse and carried bla(NDM-1) on different plasmids. Plasmids carrying bla(NDM-1) were successfully transferred from three of the four isolates to E. coli recipients, although the transconjugants and transformants were prone to lose the transferred plasmids after passage in the absence of ampicillin selection. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the emergence of A. baumannii producing NDM-1 in China. Systemic surveillance network should be established for monitoring these resistant bacteria.
TI  - Association of red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. The relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. This study evaluated the association amongst red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (PH), gingivitis (G), chronic (CP) and aggressive (AP) periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 PH, 42 G, 219 CP and 90 AP subjects. The presence and levels of A.a, red complex (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola), Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined by DNA probes and DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: CP and AP subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of A.a, red complex and A. baumannii than G and PH individuals (p<0.01), whereas S. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in AP as compared to the other groups (p<0.001). The predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with PD and CAL >/=5 mm. Increasing age (OR 1.08), high frequency of red complex (OR 6.10), and the presence of A.a with P. aeruginosa (OR 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). Subjects harbouring a high prevalence of A.a, A. baumannii, and red complex with P. aeruginosa were more likely to have AP than CP (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimicrobial activities of alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Some natural products consisting of the alkaloids yohimbine and vincamine (indole-type), scopolamine and atropine (tropane-type), colchicine (tropolone-type), allantoin (imidazolidine-type), trigonelline (pyridine-type) as well as octopamine, synephrine, and capsaicin (exocyclic amine-type); the flavonoid derivatives quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin, and silibinin; and the phenolic acids namely gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinic acid, were tested for their in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiviral activity of the compounds was tested against DNA virus herpes simplex type 1 and RNA virus parainfluenza (type-3). Cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines, and their cytopathogenic effects were expressed as maximum non-toxic concentration. Antibacterial activity was assayed against following bacteria and their isolated strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis, although they were screened by microdilution method against two fungi: Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. RESULTS: Atropine and gallic acid showed potent antiviral effect at the therapeutic range of 0.8-0.05 microg ml(-1), whilst all of the compounds exerted robust antibacterial effect. CONCLUSION: Antiviral and antimicrobial effects of the compounds tested herein may constitute a preliminary step for further relevant studies to identify the mechanism of action.
TI  - Activity of the efflux pump inhibitor phenylalanine-arginine beta-naphthylamide against the AdeFGH pump of Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - AdeFGH is a multidrug resistance efflux pump of Acinetobacter baumannii belonging to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family. Analysis of expression of this pump established it as the most prevalent RND pump in clinical isolates of A. baumannii from Canadian hospitals. In this study, the activity of the efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) phenylalanine-arginine beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN) against the RND efflux pump AdeFGH of A. baumannii was analysed. The adeFGH operon was cloned under the control of the tac promoter and was introduced in single copy into a surrogate Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain that is devoid of its six native efflux pumps. Isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was used to induce expression of the pump and the sensitivity of strains expressing the adeFGH operon to PAbetaN was analysed in the surrogate strain and in clinical isolates of A. baumannii by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim, chloramphenicol and clindamycin (substrates of AdeFGH) in the presence and absence of PAbetaN. PAbetaN was found to inhibit the ability of the AdeFGH pump to efflux all three antibiotics tested in the surrogate P. aeruginosa strain as well as in the A. baumannii strains. However, in A. baumannii strains the inhibition was more profound for clindamycin than for trimethoprim and chloramphenicol. In addition, these data also support the importance of a strain devoid of efflux pumps for screening of EPIs, since the inhibition of AdeFGH by PAbetaN was found to be more effective in the surrogate P. aeruginosa strain than in the clinical isolates of A. baumannii.
TI  - Characterization of Acinetobacter baumannii and meropenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Canada: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - A total of 66 (0.35% of overall isolates) Acinetobacter baumannii and 102 (0.55%) meropenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified among 18 538 isolates collected from medical centers across Canada during the 2007-2009 period. A. baumannii was most frequently recovered from patients in intensive care units (ICUs; 42.4%) and was isolated mostly from blood cultures (53.0%) and respiratory tract specimens (33.3%). Colistin, meropenem, and amikacin were the most active agents against A. baumannii strains (>/= 92.4% coverage). Gentamicin, levofloxacin, and tigecycline were also active against this bacterial species (MIC(50) 1, 0.12, and 0.5 mug/mL, respectively). Multidrug resistance (MDR; resistance to >/= 3 antimicrobial classes) was noted in only 4 strains (6.1%), and molecular typing revealed 6 clusters of 2 isolates per cluster that displayed >85% similarity on the dendrogram. Meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates were primarily obtained from patients in ICUs (40.2%) and the most prevalent specimen types were those collected from the respiratory tract (63.7%), followed by blood cultures (18.6%). Most of the meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa were resistant to all antimicrobial agents tested, and low susceptibility rates were observed for levofloxacin (8.8%) and gentamicin (28.4%). Amikacin and colistin were active against 67.7% and 88.2% of the isolates, respectively. A total of 68.6% (n = 70) of meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa were MDR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed 94 unique isolates and 2 small clusters (6 and 4 isolates, 1 hospital each). In summary, MDR A. baumannii are rare in Canada and, conversely, meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa were mostly MDR; however, there was minimal clonal spread among these nonfermentative bacilli.
TI  - Introduction to the CANWARD Study (2007-2009).
AB  
TI  - Activity of a novel combination against multidrug-resistant nonfermenters: ceftazidime plus NXL104.
AB  - AmpC overexpression appears to be a significant mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other nonfermenter Gram-negatives. The article under review describes the in vitro activity of a novel combination ceftazidime plus NXL104, against ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex and OXA carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii. The study results show that NXL104 overcomes the ceftazidime resistance engendered by AmpC enzymes, even when these are completely derepressed. NXL104 has shown good activity against ESBL PER-1 in P. aeruginosa, as well as against most of the B. cepacia complex isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis. Nevertheless, NXL104 does not inhibit metallo-carbapenemases, which were excluded from this investigation, nor does it reverse resistance associated with oxacillin-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa or with oxacillin-type carbapenemases in Acinetobacter spp. In the worldwide context of high rates of bacterial resistance, the combination of NXL104 with ceftazidime could represent a promising therapeutic strategy to treat infections due to AmpC-mediated resistance in P. aeruginosa, among other multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Rapid genotyping of Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates using melting curve analysis of RAPD-generated DNA fragments (McRAPD).
AB  - Typing of bacteria is important for monitoring newly emerging pathogens and for examining local outbreaks. We evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA technique in combination with melting curve analysis (McRAPD) of the amplified DNA fragments to genotype isolates from five Gram-negative species, i.e. Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. By determining the melting temperature peaks of the amplified DNA fragments, we were able to distinguish the different genotypes of isolates, as they had been assessed by other genotyping techniques, i.e. agarose gel electrophoresis of RAPD fragments, multilocus sequence typing and/or AFLP. According to our results, McRAPD may offer the possibility of genotyping a limited number of bacterial isolates, e.g. in case of suspicion of hospital outbreak, via a less costly, more rapid, less laborious and more user-friendly technique than RAPD followed by electrophoresis.
TI  - The characteristics of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli isolated from sputum and urine: a single center experience in Korea.
AB  - Metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) production usually results in high-level resistance  to most beta-lactams, and a rapid spread of MBL producing major gram-negative pathogens is a matter of particular concern worldwide. However, clinical data are scarce and most studies compared MBL producer (MP) with MBL non-producer (MNP) strains which included carbapenem susceptible isolates. Therefore, we collected clinical data of patients in whom imipenem-nonsusceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) were isolated from sputum or urine, and investigated MBL production and the risk factors related with MBL acquisition. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were also compared between MPs and imipenem-nonsusceptible MNPs (INMNP). Among the 176 imipenem-nonsusceptible isolates, 12 MPs (6.8%) were identified. There was no identifiable risk factor that contributed to the acquisition of MPs when compared to INMNPs, and case-fatalities were not different between the two groups. The percentage of susceptible isolates was higher among MPs for piperacilin/tazobactam and fluoroquinolones while that of ceftazidime was higher in INMNPs (p < 0.05). As regards to aztreonam, which has been known to be a uniquely stable beta-lactam against MBLs, susceptibility was preserved in only two isolates (16.7%) among MPs, and was not higher than that of INMNPs (23.2%). In conclusion, the contribution of MBLs to imipenem non-susceptibility in PA/ABs isolated from sputum and urine was relatively limited, and there was no significant risk factor associated with acquisition of MPs compared with INMNPs. However, limited susceptibility to aztreonam implies that MPs may hold additional resistance mechanisms, such as extended spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases, or other non-enzymatic mechanisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial drug resistance in Taiwan.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. Geographic variations in resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens have had a considerable impact on antimicrobial prescription. In Taiwan, there is an alarmingly high prevalence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and azole-resistant Candida species. In addition, the emergence of XDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of the resistance profiles of clinical isolates. A few clones of XDR A. baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of unique sequence type (ST 59) have disseminated in Taiwanese hospital settings. Besides, the existence of a transposon-harboring carbapenemase gene has been verified in XDR P aeruginosa strains throughout Taiwan. An end to the worsening trends in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance will require continuous survey of resistance data from clinical isolates and effective implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings and animal husbandry.
TI  - Multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria: the role of high-risk clones in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Multilocus sequence typing reveals that many bacterial species have a clonal structure and that some clones are widespread. This underlying phylogeny was not revealed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, a method better suited to short-term outbreak investigation. Some global clones are multiresistant and it is easy to assume that these have disseminated from single foci. Such conclusions need caution, however, unless there is a clear epidemiological trail, as with KPC carbapenemase-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 from Greece to northwest Europe. Elsewhere, established clones may have repeatedly and independently acquired resistance. Thus, the global ST131 Escherichia coli clone most often has CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), but also occurs without ESBLs and as a host of many other ESBL types. We explore this interaction of clone and resistance for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii- a species where three global lineages dominate--and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which shows clonal diversity, but includes the relatively 'tight' serotype O12/Burst Group 4 cluster that has proved adept at acquiring resistances--from PSE-1 to VIM-1 beta-lactamases--for over 20 years. In summary, 'high-risk clones' play a major role in the spread of resistance, with the risk lying in their tenacity--deriving from poorly understood survival traits--and a flexible ability to accumulate and switch resistance, rather than to constant resistance batteries.
TI  - A multicentre surveillance study on the characteristics, bacterial aetiologies and in vitro antibiotic susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem and the prevalence is high in many Asian countries. METHODS: A prospective observational study of the prevalence of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) was conducted in Indonesia, Philippines, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong from August 2006 to April 2008. The diagnosis of AECB was based on increased cough and worsening of two of following: dyspnoea, increased sputum volume or purulence. Patients who had taken antibiotics within 72 h of presentation were excluded. All bacterial strains were submitted to a central laboratory for re-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to 16 antimicrobial agents according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: Four hundred and seven isolates were identified among 447 patients of AECB. The most frequent organisms isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae and associated species (n = 91 + 17), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 71), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 63), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 32), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 22) and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 21). According to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute susceptibility breakpoints, 85.7% and >90% of these pathogens were susceptible to levofloxacin and cefepime respectively. Other options with overall lower susceptibilities include imipenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin/clavulanate. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria including Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. constitute a large proportion of pathogens identified in patients with AECB in some Asian countries. Surveillance on the local prevalence and antibiotic resistance of these organisms is important in guiding appropriate choice of antimicrobials in the management of AECB.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. MICs of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight French hospitals. Disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM). The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by MIC(50/90) (MICs for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/L), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant CoNS, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.25/1; Enterococcus faecium, 64/128; Enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; Acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; Haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. According to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for MICs of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/L respectively. In conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA but not E. faecium, whilst maintaining a Gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. Thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - The prevention of biofilm colonization by multidrug-resistant pathogens that cause ventilator-associated pneumonia with antimicrobial-coated endotracheal tubes.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) continues to be the nosocomial infection associated with the highest mortality in critically ill patients. Since silver-coated endotracheal tubes (ETT) was shown in a multicenter prospective randomized trials to decrease the risk of VAP, we compared the efficacy of two antiseptic agents such as gardine- and gendine-coated ETTs with that of silver-coated ETTs in preventing biofilm. The ETTs were tested for their ability to prevent the biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Candida albicans. Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed a heavy biofilm on uncoated and silver-coated ETT but not on the gardine-coated ETT. The gardine and gendine ETTs completely inhibited the formation of biofilms by all organisms tested and were more effective in preventing biofilm growth than the silver ETTs (p < 0.001). The gardine- and gendine-coated ETTs were more durable against MRSA than either the silver-coated or uncoated ETTs for up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001). We have therefore shown that gardine- and gendine-coated ETTs are superior to silver-coated ETTs in preventing biofilm. Future animal and clinical studies are warranted to determine whether the gardine- and gendine-coated ETTs can significantly reduce the risk of VAP.
TI  - Chitosan augments photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) was shown to be a promising treatment modality for microbial infections. This study explores the effect of chitosan, a polycationic biopolymer, in increasing the PDI efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), as well as the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Chitosan at <0.1% was included in the antibacterial process either by coincubation with hematoporphyrin (Hp) and subjection to light exposure to induce the PDI effect or by addition after PDI and further incubation for 30 min. Under conditions in which Hp-PDI killed the microbe on a 2- to 4-log scale, treatment with chitosan at concentrations of as low as 0.025% for a further 30 min completely eradicated the bacteria (which were originally at approximately 10(8) CFU/ml). Similar results were also found with toluidine blue O (TBO)-mediated PDI in planktonic and biofilm cells. However, without PDI treatment, chitosan alone did not exert significant antimicrobial activity with 30 min of incubation, suggesting that the potentiated effect of chitosan worked after the bacterial damage induced by PDI. Further studies indicated that the potentiated PDI effect of chitosan was related to the level of PDI damage and the deacetylation level of the chitosan. These results indicate that the combination of PDI and chitosan is quite promising for eradicating microbial infections.
TI  - Frequency and susceptibility pattern of metallo-beta-lactamase producers in a hospital in Pakistan.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The rapid spread of acquired metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) among major Gram-negative pathogens is an emerging threat and a matter of particular concern worldwide. METHODOLOGY: This descriptive study was conducted between January and August 2009 in the department of Microbiology, Army Medical College, National University of Sciences and Technology, Rawalpindi, to determine the frequency and susceptibility patterns of MBL-producers among carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative rods (GNRs) from clinical isolates of a tertiary care hospital. All clinical samples were processed according to standard microbiological methods. Isolated GNRs were subjected to susceptibility testing against various antibiotics by disc diffusion method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Carbapenem-resistant isolates were subjected to the detection of MBL production by the E-test MBL strip method. RESULTS: Out of 50 carbapenem resistant isolates, 39 (78%) of were confirmed to be MBL producers by the E-strip method. Acinetobacter baumannii were the most frequent MBL producers, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A total of 19 (37%) of the MBL producers were susceptible to cefoperazone-sulbactam. CONCLUSION: The findings strongly suggest that there is a need to track the detection of MBL producers and that judicious use of carbapenems is necessary to prevent the further spread of these organisms.
TI  - Intravenous colistin administration in neonates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infection due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens in intensive care units is a challenge for clinicians and microbiologists, and has led to resurgence of parenteral colistin use in the last decade. Safety and efficacy data regarding intravenous colistin (colistimethate) use in neonates is sparse. We present our experience of efficacy and safety of colistimethate in the treatment of sepsis in critically sick term and preterm neonates. METHODS: The records of the neonates who received colistimethate in a neonatal intensive care unit of a tertiary care center from January 2009 to December 2009 were reviewed. RESULTS: Eighteen critically sick neonates (10 term and 8 preterm) received 21 courses of colistimethate (dose ranging from 50,000 to 75,000 IU/kg/d) for treatment of pneumonia, blood stream infections, meningitis, and empyema thoracis. The isolated pathogens in decreasing order of frequency were Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonos aeruginosa, and Enterobacter. Mean duration of colistimethate was 13.1 days/course (range: 5-21 days). At least one other antibiotic was coadministered in all courses. A favorable clinical outcome occurred in 16 of 21 (76%) courses, 5 patients died due to severe sepsis with multiple organ dysfunction. Microbiologic clearance was documented in 17 courses. Increase in serum creatinine by > 0.5 mg/dL above baseline in 2 babies was associated with the presence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in both and coadministration of netilmicin in one. CONCLUSIONS: Colistimethate intravenous administration appears to be safe and efficacious for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections in neonates, including preterm and extremely low birth weight neonates.
TI  - Suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  - Acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. The main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of Suprathel (PolyMedics Innovations GmbH, Denkendorf, Germany) in combination with various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. The study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "Suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (Suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [Betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [Lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [Octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [Hibicet]). As a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups A and B. The tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, and A baumannii, except for the combination of Suprathel and mafenide acetate. It can be concluded that Suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. The authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. The combination of Suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.
TI  - Prevalence of carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in high complexity hospital.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are Gram-negative bacilli that in the last decades have become prevalent agents of hospital infection due to high antimicrobial resistance developed by these microorganisms. The present study is a retrospective analysis of all positive cultures for these microorganisms in the period of January 2004 to December 2008. Resistance levels of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa to carbapenems was high and showed a trend to increase during the period of study. In recent years the increasing incidence and resistance levels of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa to the antimicrobials used for their treatment in the hospital setting underscores the relevance of infections caused by these bacteria. The selective pressure caused by indiscriminated use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in empirical hospital infections is probably the main reason for such an increase with the consequent impact upon patient morbidity and mortality.
TI  - Rational design of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides to target Gram-negative pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa: utilization of charge, 'specificity determinants,' total hydrophobicity, hydrophobe type and location as design parameters to improve the therapeutic ratio.
AB  - The rapidly growing problem of increased resistance to classical antibiotics makes the development of new classes of antimicrobial agents with lower rates of resistance urgent. Amphipathic cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides have been proposed as a potential new class of antimicrobial agents. The goal of this study was to take a broad-spectrum, 26-residue, antimicrobial peptide in the all-D conformation, peptide D1 (K13) with excellent biologic properties and address the question of whether a rational design approach could be used to enhance the biologic properties if the focus was on Gram-negative pathogens only. To test this hypothesis, we used 11 and 6 diverse strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. We optimized the number and location of positively charged residues on the polar face, the number, location, and type of hydrophobe on the non-polar face and varied the number of 'specificity determinants' in the center of the non-polar face from 1 to 2 to develop four new antimicrobial peptides. We demonstrated not only improvements in antimicrobial activity, but also dramatic reductions in hemolytic activity and unprecedented improvements in therapeutic indices. Compared to our original starting peptide D1 (V13), peptide D16 had a 746-fold improvement in hemolytic activity (i.e. decrease), maintained antimicrobial activity, and improved the therapeutic indices by 1305-fold and 895-fold against A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. The resulting therapeutic indices for D16 were 3355 and 895 for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. D16 is an ideal candidate for commercialization as a clinical therapeutic to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections.
TI  - [Antibiotic multiresistance in critical care units].
AB  - The presence of microorganisms with acquired resistance to multiple antibiotics complicates the management and outcome of critically ill patients. The intensivist, in his/her daily activity, is responsible for the prevention and control of the multiresistance and the challenge of prescribing the appropriate treatment in case of an infection by these microorganisms. We have reviewed the literature regarding the definition, important concepts related to transmission, recommendations on general measures of control in the units and treatment options. We also present data on the situation in our country known primarily through the ENVIN-UCI register. Addressing the multiresistance not only requires training but also teamwork with other specialists and adaptation to the local environment.
TI  - [In vitro antimicrobial activity of piperacillin-sulbactam and other 7 antimicrobial agents against non-fermentative bacilli].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of piperacillin-sulbactam against clinical isolates of non-fermentative bacilli isolated from common infections. METHODS: Microdilution was employed to study the antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: A total of 770 strains were collected from 6 hospitals in Guangzhou, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Flavobacterium, and Alcaligenes. Compared with other beta-lactams, piperacillin-sulbactam displayed the highest activity against all the isolates of P.aeruginosa, especially for imipenem non-sensitive isolates, with the susceptibility of 71.9% and 55.8%, respectively. Piperacillin-sulbactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam kept good activity against imipenem sensitive isolates of A.baumannii, with the susceptibility of 71.0% and 73.0%, respectively. For the strains of Burkholderia cepacia, 69% strains exhibited minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of </= 16 mg/L for piperacillin-sulbactam. For the strains of Flavobacterium, and Alcaligenes, piperacillin-sulbactam also had excellent activity, with the susceptibility of 70.2% and 94.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Piperacillin-sulbactam exhibits good activity again non-fermentative bacilli, especially for imipenem non-sensitive isolates of P.aeruginosa.
TI  - Purification and properties of antimicrobial peptides from skin secretions of the Eritrea clawed frog Xenopus clivii (Pipidae).
AB  - Five peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the tetraploid frog Xenopus clivii Peracca, 1898 (Pipidae). Characterization of the peptides demonstrated that they are structurally similar to magainins (2 peptides), caerulein-precursor fragments, CPF (2 peptides), and xenopsin-precursor fragments, XPF (1 peptide) that have been previously isolated from other species of the genus Xenopus. The magainins and the XPF peptide were active only against the Gram-negative microorganism Escherichia coli whereas the CPF peptides were also active against the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The most abundant antimicrobial peptide in the secretions, CPF-C1 (GFGSLLGKALRLG ANVL.NH(2)) inhibited the growth of the Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC</=25muM) suggesting potential for development into an anti-infective agent for use against these emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
TI  - [Microbiological profile and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers in a Portuguese hospital].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the microbiological profile and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers in a Portuguese hospital. METHODS: Microbiological data from ambulatory and hospitalized patients with diabetic foot infection during the year 2010 were retrospectively analysed. The profile of the isolated organisms was identified, regarding their prevalence both in the outpatient and inpatient settings. Multidrug-resistant organisms ( MDRO ) under surveillance program at the hospital and their antibiotic susceptibility tests were analysed. RESULTS: Gram-positive aerobes were most frequently isolated ( 59.6 % ) from outpatient diabetic foot ulcers. Staphylococcus was the main genus identified ( 49.8 % ), of which 70.0 % were methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Considering samples obtained from hospitalized patients, Gram-negative aerobes were dominant ( 63.3 % ), mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( 35.5 % ). Staphylococcus aureus represented 22.2 % of all isolates, with 60.0 % methicillin-resistance. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase production and methicillin resistance was noted in 35.0 % and 38.0 % of all bacterial isolates, respectively. High levels of resistance were also documented for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii complex. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological differences seem to exist between the outpatient and inpatient settings concerning the microbiological profile of clinically infected diabetic foot ulcers. MDRO are prevalent in this study. Other studies are needed in order to adapt empirical therapy to the portuguese reality.
TI  - Bactericidal oncocin derivatives with superior serum stabilities.
AB  - The proline-rich antimicrobial peptide oncocin is remarkably active in vitro against a number of important Gram-negative bacteria of concern to humans owing to their increasing resistance to antibiotics, i.e. Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenting species (Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Degradation of oncocin in mouse serum was investigated in this study. Several approaches to stabilise the main cleavage sites (C-terminal to Arg-15 and N-terminal to Arg-19) by substituting either or both arginine (Arg) residues with non-proteinogenic amino acids, i.e. alpha-amino-3-guanidino-propionic acid, homoarginine, nitro-arginine, N-methyl-arginine, beta-homoarginine, D-arginine (D-Arg) or ornithine (Orn), were tested. These modifications were found to increase the half-life of oncocin in full mouse serum. For oncocin with two Orn residues in positions 15 and 19, the half-life in full serum increased from 25 min to 3 h. An increase of >8 h was observed for oncocin with two D-Arg residues at these same positions. The antibacterial activities of these modified sequences were slightly better than the original oncocin sequence. Moreover, the three most stable analogues were found to be bactericidal against E. coli and were not toxic to HeLa cells or haemolytic to human erythrocytes.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic profiling of intravenous antibiotics against prevalent Gram-negative organisms across the globe: the PASSPORT Program-Asia-Pacific Region.
AB  - Due to escalating antimicrobial resistance amongst Gram-negative organisms, the choice of effective empirical antimicrobial regimens has become challenging. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted for conventional and prolonged infusion regimens of doripenem, imipenem and meropenem using pharmacokinetic data from adult patients with conserved renal function. Minimum inhibitory concentration data against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were incorporated from the COMPACT surveillance programme in the Asia-Pacific region of the world. The cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was determined for each regimen against each bacterial population. All simulated carbapenem regimens achieved an optimal CFR against E. coli and K. pneumoniae (94.5-100% CFR). Against P. aeruginosa, doripenem achieved 78.7-92.6% CFR, imipenem achieved 60.4-79.0% CFR and meropenem achieved 73.0-85.1% CFR. The only dosing regimen to achieve >/= 90% CFR against P. aeruginosa was doripenem 1000 mg and 2000 mg every 8 h (4-h infusion). Carbapenem CFRs against A. baumannii were much lower (29.2-54.4% CFR). CFRs for non-fermenting isolates were ca. 10% lower for isolates collected in the Intensive Care Unit. Carbapenem resistance amongst Enterobacteriaceae remains low in the Asia-Pacific region and thus standard carbapenem dosing regimens had a high likelihood of achieving pharmacodynamic exposures. However, larger doses combined with prolonged infusion will be required to increase the CFR for these carbapenems against resistant non-fermenting Gram-negatives that are common in these countries. The safety and efficacy of these high dosing regimens will need to be confirmed in the clinical setting.
TI  - Interspecies dissemination of the bla gene encoding PER-1 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.
AB  - PER-1 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli are resistant to oxyimino-cephalosporins. However, the bla(PER-1) gene has never been reported in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Here, we studied interspecies dissemination of the bla(PER-1) gene by horizontal transfer of Tn1213 among Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. In a K. pneumoniae clinical isolate, the bla(PER-1) gene was located on a 150-kbp incompatibility group A/C plasmid.
TI  - Biochemical and structural characterization of the subclass B1 metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-4.
AB  - The metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-4, mainly found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii, was produced in Escherichia coli and characterized by biochemical and X-ray techniques. A detailed kinetic study performed in the presence of Zn(2)+ at concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 100 muM showed that VIM-4 exhibits a kinetic profile similar to the profiles of VIM-2 and VIM-1. However, VIM-4 is more active than VIM-1 against benzylpenicillin, cephalothin, nitrocefin, and imipenem and is less active than VIM-2 against ampicillin and meropenem. The crystal structure of the dizinc form of VIM-4 was solved at 1.9 A. The sole difference between VIM-4 and VIM-1 is found at residue 228, which is Ser in VIM-1 and Arg in VIM-4. This substitution has a major impact on the VIM-4 catalytic efficiency compared to that of VIM-1. In contrast, the differences between VIM-2 and VIM-4 seem to be due to a different position of the flapping loop and two substitutions in loop 2. Study of the thermal stability and the activity of the holo- and apo-VIM-4 enzymes revealed that Zn(2)+ ions have a pronounced stabilizing effect on the enzyme and are necessary for preserving the structure.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in a general intensive care unit in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria causing infections in patients at the intensive care units (ICUs) of Riyadh Military Hospital (RMH), as well as their antimicrobial resistance patterns for one year. METHODS: A retrospective, cohort investigation was performed. Laboratory records from January to December 2009 were studied for the prevalence of MDR Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and their antimicrobial resistance in ICU patients from RMH, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 1210 isolates were collected from various specimens such as: respiratory (469), blood (400), wound/tissue (235), urinary (56), nasal swabs (35), and cerebro-spinal fluid (15). Regardless of the specimen, there was a high rate of nosocomial MDR organisms isolated from patients enrolled in the General ICU (GICU) in Riyadh. Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) comprised 40.9%, Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia) - 19.4%, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) formed 16.3% of these isolates. CONCLUSION: The P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (methycillin sensitive and methycillin resistant), and Staphylococccus coagulase negative are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in the GICU of RMH. Respiratory tract specimens represented nearly 39% of all the specimens collected in the ICU. The most common MDR organisms isolated in this unit were A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - A difficult case of necrotizing fasciitis caused by Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - This study reports the case of a 55-year-old woman with diabetes with a necrotizing fasciitis of the right lower limb and the perineum, first admitted at the emergency department for septic shock with cardiac arrest, and later transferred to the department of surgery. Microbiological and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis caused by Acinetobacter baumannii. A broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was administered and later readjusted according to the results of microbiological culture. Intensive hemodynamic support was required. Wounds were dressed daily with a 3 percent boric acid solution and a silver sulfadiazine-impregnated dressing. An extensive surgical debridement was promptly performed and repeated until complete control of the infection. Wounds were finally covered with split-thickness skin grafts. The infection was overcome 35 days after admission. The graft take was 100%. Postoperative rehabilitation was required because of the functional limitation of lower limb movements. Follow-up at 6 months showed no functional deficit and an acceptable aesthetic result. Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening disorder, especially in patients with diabetes, whose clinical diagnosis may sometimes be challenging. Early recognition and treatment represent the most important factors influencing survival.
TI  - [Infection in patients with malignant tumors].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characters of infection in patients with malignant  tumors, especially the distribution, yearly change of pathogens, and pathogen resistance to common antibacterial agents. METHODS: We respectively analyzed the characters of infection in 489 patients with malignant tumors. RESULTS: The respiratory tract was the most frequent infection site (61.1%). The infection was mainly caused by opportunistic pathogens. The Gram-negative bacterias mainly consisted of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii (46.3%). The Gram-positive bacteria mainly consisted of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (29.9%), and the rest 23.8% of the infection was caused by different fungi, mainly consisting of Candida albicans. The ratio of the Gram-negative bacteria resistance to antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins (except ceftazidime), sulfanilamides, tetracyclines and quinolones was higher. The ratio of the Gram-positive bacteria resistance to antibiotics such as penicillins, macrolides and quinolones was higher. The ratio of fungus resistance to antibacterial agents such as fluconazol and itraconazole was higher. The infection caused by fungi obviously increased in the past 5 years. CONCLUSION: The infection in patients with malignant tumors is mainly caused by opportunistic pathogens, and the pathogen resistance to antibacterial agents is serious. The infection caused by fungi is increasing.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a novel aminoglycoside, ACHN-490, against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from New York City.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have become a global problem, often leaving the polymyxins as therapeutic agents of last resort. ACHN-490, a next-generation aminoglycoside with activity against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, was examined against clinical isolates of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. METHODS: The activity of aminoglycosides and ACHN-490 was determined against a contemporary collection of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Selected aminoglycoside-resistant isolates were screened for the presence of genes encoding common aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and methylases. RESULTS: Resistance to the traditional aminoglycosides was common in the collection of A. baumannii. ACHN-490 possessed superior activity against these isolates, with an MIC(50) value of 8 mg/L. In P. aeruginosa, the activity of ACHN-490 was similar to that of amikacin (MIC(50) value of 8 mg/L for both agents). For both A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, the MICs of ACHN-490 did not correlate with the presence of commonly encountered aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: For A. baumannii, the MICs of ACHN-490 were lower than those of traditional aminoglycosides. For P. aeruginosa, the activity of ACHN-490 was similar to that of amikacin.
TI  - [The growing problem of antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria: current situation].
AB  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents in clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria  is an increasingly important problem, which in the last few years has spread from the hospital setting to the community. In enterobacteria, the main features of this situation include resistance to beta-lactams and quinolones. beta-Lactam resistance is caused by intrinsic beta-lactamases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, plasmid-mediated cephamycinases and carbapenemses, particularly when produced in strains with decreased permeability because of altered porin expression. Quinolone resistance is a multifactorial problem in which the importance of plasmid-mediated mechanisms (Qnr proteins, acetylase, active efflux pumps) is being recognized. Several studies in Spain and other countries show that strains with these resistance mechanisms are being isolated with increased frequency. Of particular concern is the spread of Escherichia coli and other species producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (most frequently of the CTX-M family), affecting outpatients. Very commonly these mechanisms are simultaneously expressed within the same bacterial host, leading to a multiresistance phenotype. This problem is also of major clinical importance in non-fermenting Gram-negative rods, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii and, to a lesser extent, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and some other species. Multiresistance in non-fermenting organisms results from the presence of intrinsic mechanisms (production of distinct beta-lactamases, decreased permeability and expression of several active efflux pumps) and from the acquisition of exogenous genes. Therapeutic difficulties reach their maximum when bacteria express resistance to carbapenems (a multifactorial problem) or to polymyxins. New compounds with specific activity against multiresistant Gram-negative rods should be developed, which, together with other measures, would contribute to controlling the current serious situation.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria: how to treat and for how long.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacilli creates a big problem for the treatment of nosocomial infections. As the pharmaceutical pipeline wanes, the only therapeutic options are two revived antibacterials (colistin and fosfomycin), a newer one (tigecycline) and an early-phase neoglycoside (ACHN-490). Polymyxins, known since 1947, are mostly represented by polymyxin E (colistin), which has recently gained a principal position in the management of the most difficult-to-treat MDR Gram-negative pathogens -Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, despite promising therapeutic results in 59-75% of cases, the reported studies share common drawbacks, i.e. the absence of a control group, their retrospective nature, variable dosing and duration of therapy, simultaneous administration of other antibiotics in >70% and a lack of resistance development monitoring. The necessity for well-designed prospective clinical trials is therefore urgent. Fosfomycin is active in vitro against MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including a high proportion of P. aeruginosa; however, clinical experience is lacking with the parenteral formulation in MDR infection and on the best combinations to prevent resistance development. Tigecycline, which is active against MDR Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii, has shown satisfactory clinical experience. However, dosage adjustment is required because of low blood levels. ACHN-490, which has promising in vitro activity against MDR K. pneumoniae, is still in early phase II trials in urinary tract infections. Meanwhile, the strict application of infection control measures is the cornerstone of nosocomial infection prevention, and antibiotic stewardship, exemplified by appropriate duration of therapy and de-escalation policies, should not be overlooked.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic evaluation of colistin sodium.
AB  - IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Although colistin has recently played a key role in the  treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug resistant Gram-negative pathogens, there is a lack of clinical studies examining colistin pharmacokinetics (PKs) in humans. This refers to all routes of colistin administration in clinical practice. Colistin PK data are also limited in critically ill patients. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Literature search took into account data dealing with colistin PK obtained from animal studies performed during previous decades (1970s, 1980s and 1990s) and from recent human studies performed during the last decade. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Valuable information on pharmacodynamics (PD)/PK of colistin used in the treatments of nosocomial infections due to multidrug resistant Gram-negative pathogens, mostly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A better understanding of PKs could offer significant improvement of colistin use in humans, especially optimization of colistin doses in different routes of administration in order to maximize clinical efficacy and minimize adverse effects and rate of resistance. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: There is a lack of human studies on colistin PK and PD. Significant PD parameters best predicting colistin efficacy and their optimal values such as C(max):MIC ratio, AUC/MIC and T > MIC have not yet been clearly defined. It should be noted that further investigation on colistin PK/PD in vitro and in vivo models is required.
TI  - Clinical outcomes of health-care-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted to European intensive-care units: a cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to intensive-care units are at high risk of health-care-associated infections, and many are caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. We aimed to assess excess mortality and length of stay in intensive-care units from bloodstream infections and pneumonia. METHODS: We analysed data collected prospectively from intensive-care units that reported according to the European standard protocol for surveillance of health-care-associated infections. We focused on the most frequent causative microorganisms. Resistance was defined as resistance to ceftazidime (Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa), third-generation cephalosporins (Escherichia coli), and oxacillin (Staphylococcus aureus). We defined 20 different exposures according to infection site, microorganism, and resistance status. For every exposure, we compared outcomes between patients exposed and unexposed by use of time-dependent regression modelling. We adjusted results for patients' characteristics and time-dependency of the exposure. FINDINGS: We obtained data for 119 699 patients who were admitted for more than 2 days to 537 intensive-care units in ten countries between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2008. Excess risk of death (hazard ratio) for pneumonia in the fully adjusted model ranged from 1.7 (95% CI 1.4-1.9) for drug-sensitive S aureus to 3.5 (2.9-4.2) for drug-resistant P aeruginosa. For bloodstream infections, the excess risk ranged from 2.1 (1.6-2.6) for drug-sensitive S aureus to 4.0 (2.7-5.8) for drug-resistant P aeruginosa. Risk of death associated with antimicrobial resistance (ie, additional risk of death to that of the infection) was 1.2 (1.1-1.4) for pneumonia and 1.2 (0.9-1.5) for bloodstream infections for a combination of all four microorganisms, and was highest for S aureus (pneumonia 1.3 [1.0-1.6], bloodstream infections 1.6 [1.1-2.3]). Antimicrobial resistance did not significantly increase length of stay; the hazard ratio for discharge, dead or alive, for sensitive microorganisms compared with resistant microorganisms (all four combined) was 1.05 (0.97-1.13) for pneumonia and 1.02 (0.98-1.17) for bloodstream infections. P aeruginosa had the highest burden of health-care-acquired infections because of its high prevalence and pathogenicity of both its drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. INTERPRETATION: Health-care-associated bloodstream infections and pneumonia greatly increase mortality and pneumonia increase length of stay in intensive-care units; the additional effect of the most common antimicrobial resistance patterns is comparatively low. FUNDING: European Commission (DG Sanco).
TI  - Resurgence of colistin: a review of resistance, toxicity, pharmacodynamics, and dosing.
AB  - Colistin is a polymyxin antibiotic that was discovered in the late 1940s for the  treatment of gram-negative infections. After several years of clinical use, its popularity diminished because of reports of significant nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Recently, the antibiotic has resurfaced as a last-line treatment option for multidrug-resistant organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The need for antibiotics with coverage of these gram-negative pathogens is critical because of their high morbidity and mortality, making colistin a very important treatment option. Unfortunately, however, resistance to colistin has been documented among all three of these organisms in case reports. Although the exact mechanism causing colistin resistance has not been defined, it is hypothesized that the PmrA-PmrB and PhoP-PhoQ genetic regulatory systems may play a role. Colistin dosages must be optimized, as colistin is a last-line treatment option; in addition, suboptimal doses have been linked to the development of resistance. The lack of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and no universal harmonization of dose units, however, have made it difficult to derive optimal dosing regimens and specific dosing guidelines for colistin. In critically ill patients who may have multiorgan failure, renal insufficiency may alter colistin pharmacokinetics. Therefore, dosage alterations in this patient population are imperative to achieve maximal efficacy and minimal toxicity. With regard to colistin toxicity, most studies show that nephrotoxicity is reversible and less frequent than once thought, and neurotoxicity is rare. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact that the two regulatory systems have on resistance, as well as the dosages of colistin needed to inhibit and overcome these developing patterns.
TI  - [Changes in the bacterial spectrum in severe burn wounds].
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the time axis for increase in Gram negative bacterial strains in burn wounds during hospitalization. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients hospitalized at the Clinic of burns and reconstructive surgery between 2006 and 2008 were enrolled in the study. The major criteria for enrolment were more than 15% of total body surface area (TBSA) burned, hospital stay of 1 month or more and age over 18 years. Specimens for microbiological examination were collected on days 2, 6, 10, 14 and 20 after admission. RESULTS: A total of 777 bacterial strains were isolated from the study patients, with 64.6% of these strains being Gram positive and 35.4% Gram negative. The most frequently isolated Gram positive pathogens were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (260 strains) and Bacillus sp. (113 strains), while the most common Gram negative pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (81 strains), Escherichia coli (63 strains) and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (57 strains). CONCLUSION: The study provided data that supports the assumption of increase in Gram negative bacterial strains in burn wounds during hospitalization. Nevertheless, even on day 20 after admission, such strains did not predominate.
TI  - [Gram-negative bacteriae with resistance to carbapenems].
AB  - Clinically-significant Gram-negative species remain mostly Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Carbapenem molecules are often the last resort for treating infections due to multidrug resistant isolates. In Enterobacteriaceae, resistance to carbapenems may result from combined mechanisms of resistance associating b-lactamases with weak (if any) intrinsic carbapenemase activity and decreased outer membrane permeability, or from true carbapenemases. KPC-type enzymes (partially inhibited by clavulanic acid) have been identified mostly in Klebsiella pneumoniae, first in bacteria identified in the USA and then worldwide, and in many enterobacterial species. Carbapenem-hydrolyzing b-lactamases (CHBL) could be also metallo-b-lactamases (VIM, IMP, NDM-1, etc.) mostly in hospital-acquired K. pneumoniae. One of the latest reported CHBL in Enterobacteriaceae is OXA-48, identified mostly in Mediterranean countries. All these carbapenemase producers are difficult to detect in a clinical laboratory and may be the source of multidrug resistance leading to a therapeutic dead end. Whereas the main mechanism of resistance to imipenem in P. aeruginosa remains due to a modification of the outer membrane protein OprD, the landscape of CHBL in P. aeruginosa expanding worldwide is made of KPC, GES-related enzymes and metallo-b-lactamases (IMP, VIM, etc.). These enzymes are involved in multidrug resistance strains as a source of nosocomial outbreaks. In Acinetobacter baumannii, KPC and metallo-b-lactamases have been identified. However, the most frequent CHBL are oxacillinases (OXA-23, OXA-40, OXA-58, OXA-143) which are specific to that species. Novel carbapenemases are continuously being identified worldwide with exchange of the resistance genes between Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.
TI  - Emerging resistant Gram-negative aerobic bacilli in hospital-acquired infections.
AB  - The increasing emergence of serious multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative infections has led to a new health-care crisis. These infections predominately include MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii. These organisms are present in a variety of clinical settings, but there is a distinct paucity of antibiotics to effectively treat these infections. The increasing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and lack of good stewardship have contributed to the increase in these MDR organisms. This review focuses on the main MDR Gram-negative infections contributing to the current crisis in health care, their mechanisms of resistance and various treatment options for empiric therapy.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates from intensive care unit patients of a tertiary-care university hospital in Iran: 2006-2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among common pathogens in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital in Iran between 2006 and 2009. METHODS: The isolates cultured in appropriate media and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined by disk diffusion tests according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: A total of 606 isolates were recovered from respiratory (70.63%), urine (20.13%), blood (4.95%) and wound (1.82%) specimens of 456 patients. The most common isolates were Acinetobacter baumannii (22.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.1%), Escherichia coli (8.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.8%). Less than 7% of A. baumannii isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, imipenem, cefepime and ciprofloxacin. None was susceptible to piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam. The susceptibility rates of P. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam were 13.6, 17.4 and 33.3%, respectively. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus made up 96.2% of S. aureus isolates and was 100% susceptible to vancomycin and 51.9% susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: Due to the high antimicrobial resistance in the ICU, we must focus on both a wiser use of antimicrobials and the prevention of infection.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of doripenem against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of the study were to determine the in vitro activity of doripenem, a new carbapenem, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorization in France according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. The MICs of doripenem were determined by the broth microdilution method against 1,547 clinical isolates from eight French hospitals. The disk diffusion test was performed (10-mug discs) according to the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CASFM) method. The MIC(50/90) (mg/L) values were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (0.03/0.25), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (1/2), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCoNS) (0.03/0.12), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) (2/8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.016/0.25), viridans group streptococci (0.016/2), beta-hemolytic streptococci (</=0.008/</=0.008), Enterococcus faecalis (2/4), Enterococcus faecium (128/>128), Enterobacteriaceae (0.06/0.25), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5/8), Acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/2), Haemophilus influenzae (0.12/0.25), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.03/0.06). According to the regression curve, the zone diameter breakpoints were 24 and 19 mm for MICs of 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively. This study confirms the potent in vitro activity of doripenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, MSSA, MSCoNS, and respiratory pathogens. According to the EUCAST MIC breakpoints (mg/L) </=1/>4 for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter, and </=1/>1 for streptococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus, the zone diameter breakpoints could be (mm) >/=24/<19 and >/=24/<24, respectively.
TI  - Changing epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections in 11 teaching hospitals in Taiwan between 1993 and 2006.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Healthcare-associated infections, formerly known as nosocomial infections, are one of the most important issues in current practice. Understanding trends in overall infection rates, as well as their incidence and proportion among different causative organisms, can help us to better define our infection control methods and therapy goals. To understand the changing epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSI) in Taiwan, we retrospectively collected nosocomial infection data from 11 hospitals and examined the trends and changing patterns of nosocomial BSI. METHODS: Eleven major teaching hospitals in Taiwan were invited to participate in the study. The overall density of nosocomial infections and major BSI-causing organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Candida species, were collected. The distribution of the different Candida species was also recorded. Background parameters from the 11 hospitals, including the size of the hospital, hospital capacity, the number of blood stream infection events, and average length of stay, were also recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of nosocomial BSI ranged 0.23-2.56 per 1,000 patient-days, which accounted for 8-43% of all nosocomial infections. The most common causative organism of nosocomial bacteremia was S. aureus, ranging 0.88-0.01 per 1,000 patient-days. Overall, the incidence of S. aureus bacteremia has decreased over the last 13 years, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.053). The rate of Candida fungemia (p < 0.01) and A. baumannii (p = 0.03) bacteremia increased significantly. C. albicans accounted for most cases of nosocomial fungemia, ranging from 40% to 80%, followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida glabrata. However, the incidence varied significantly from hospital to hospital, and the highest incidence was observed in a cancer center. CONCLUSION: The overall incidence rate of S. aureus bacteremia in the 11 major hospitals studied had decreased over the last decade, though the difference was not statistically significant. However, the rate of Candida fungemia and A. baumannii bacteremia had increased significantly.
TI  - [Recent progress in taxonomic studies on pathogenic nocardia and usefulness of the bacteria for the studies on secondary metabolites and antibiotic resistant mechanisms].
AB  - The present taxonomic situation of pathogenic actinomycetes including Nocardia was clarified, and the impact of genomic sequence information of Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152 on taxonomic work is introduced. The number of cases of nocardiosis is on the rise along with the increasing number of immunocompromised patients in Japan. From 1999 to 2007, 718 strains of pathogenic actinomycetes were received for identification by Medical Mycology Research Center (MMRC), Chiba University. About 75% of these were classified into Nocardia, major species being N. farcinica, N. nova, and N. brasiliensis. Among the strains classified as Nocardia species, there were some unclassifiable strains and taxonomic studies on these led to the proposal of more than 18 new species, resulting in more than 1/4 of all Nocardia species having been proposed by our group. Recently a new Nocardia species, Nocardia mikamii was proposed by American researchers. A new phylogenetic analysis method using gryB and secA1 genes was proposed for the Nocardia and Gordonia strains.Our whole genome analysis of N. farcinica suggests that the bacterium has unique and characteristic gene profiles, and also suggests that N. farcinica is similar to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. N. farcinica also has siderophore (nocobactin) and mce genes which are similar to mycobactin (siderophore) of M. tuberculosis as virulence factors. Nocardia strains were found to be producers of new secondary metabolites including antifungal, antitumor and immunosuppressive activities.We reported novel antibiotic resistance mechanisms such as ribosylation, glucosylation, phosphorylation and degradation of rifampicin, phosphorylation of aminoglycosides, and glucosylation of macrolide antibiotics. Among rifampicin inactivation mechanisms, ribosylation was found to be through the Arr enzyme that catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of rifampicin in a fast-growing Mycobacterium smegmatis. This unique mechanism has also been reported as an antibiotic resistant mechanism in pathogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii.Our cooperative work on the elucidation of high-level resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic amikacin in N. farcinica with a research group from CDC, USA, revealed the presence of homozygous mutations in the 16R rRNA genes which are responsible for high-level aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Risk of acquiring multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli from prior room occupants in the intensive care unit.
AB  - The objective of this prospective cohort study was to determine whether admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) room previously occupied by a patient with multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) increases the risk of acquiring these bacteria by subsequent patients. All patients hospitalized for >48 h were eligible. Patients with MDR GNB at ICU admission were excluded. The MDR GNB were defined as MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) -producing GNB. All patients were hospitalized in single rooms. Cleaning of ICU rooms between two patients was performed using quaternary ammonium disinfectant. Risk factors for MDR P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and ESBL-producing GNB were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis. Five hundred and eleven consecutive patients were included; ICU-acquired MDR P. aeruginosa was diagnosed in 82 (16%) patients, A. baumannii in 57 (11%) patients, and ESBL-producing GNB in 50 (9%) patients. Independent risk factors for ICU-acquired MDR P. aeruginosa were prior occupant with MDR P. aeruginosa (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.3, p 0.012), surgery (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.6, p 0.024), and prior piperacillin/tazobactam use (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3, p 0.040). Independent risk factors for ICU-acquired A. baumannii were prior occupant with A. baumannii (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2-8.8, p <0.001), and mechanical ventilation (OR 9.3, 95% CI 1.1-83, p 0.045). Independent risk factors for ICU-acquired ESBL-producing GNB were tracheostomy (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.5, p 0.049), and sedation (OR 6.6, 95% CI 1.1-40, p 0.041). We conclude that admission to an ICU room previously occupied by a patient with MDR P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii is an independent risk factor for acquisition of these bacteria by subsequent room occupants. This relationship was not identified for ESBL-producing GNB.
TI  - [Risk of hospital death in nosocomial infection with multi-drug resistant A. baumanii or P. aeruginosa].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: assessment of the in hospital death among the patients with healthcare associated infection (HA1) provoked by multi drug resistant strains (MDR) ofP. aeruginosa or A. baumanii. METHODS: enrolled in the study were patients with bloodstream, surgical site and urinary tract HAI infection, reported during 2006-2009 in the ICU for adults and general surgery wards of two large teaching clinics for emergencies in Bucharest municipality. Associations between fatal outcome and relevant demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed both through cohort and also by case-control studies. RESULTS: in the cohort analysis both the severity of the underlying disease and also the presence of HAl with MDR strains of P. aeruginosa or A. baumanii were statistical significant (p < 0.05) and independently associated with fatal outcome; the presence of HAI with MDR strains of P. aeruginosa or A. baumanii remained significant associated with fatal outcome even after controlling of the underlying disease's severity by case-control design (Match OR: 5.89; 95% IC: 1.39-40.77; p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: the study's results demonstrate that the precautions to prevent the in hospital transmission of the MDR germs are pertinent because the HAI induced by these bugs is obviously associated with unfavorable clinical outcome of the patient.
TI  - Efficacy of concurrent application of chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone iodine against six nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and povidone iodine (PI) are rarely used concurrently despite a lack of evidence regarding functional incompatibility of these agents. METHODS: CHG and PI, alone and combined, were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible S aureus [MSSA] and methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA]), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli using checkerboard microbroth dilution techniques. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was the concentration (percent wt/vol) that reduced bacterial burden >/= 5-log(10) colony-forming units/mL at 2 hours when compared with bacterial densities in growth controls. Fractional bactericidal concentration indexes (FBCIs) were calculated to determine CHG and PI compatibility. Additionally, tissue plugs from freshly excised porcine vaginal mucosa were infected with S aureus (MSSA), treated for 2 hours with CHG 3%, PI 5%, or CHG 3% and PI 5% combined and then viable bacteria on the tissue plugs enumerated. RESULTS: In broth, CHG demonstrated dose-dependent bactericidal activity, whereas PI activity was all-or-none. All isolates studied were similarly susceptible to CHG (MBCs: 0.0078% +/- 0.0019%, 0.0069% +/- 0.0026%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0059% +/- 0.0%, and 0.0029% +/- 0.0%, respectively). The MBCs of PI were identical (0.625%) for all isolates. Overall, FBCI calculations showed indifference. Treatment of MSSA-infected porcine tissue for 2 hours demonstrated that the CHG-PI combination was superior to either antiseptic alone. CONCLUSION: FBCIs, determined in broth culture, indicate that combining CHG and PI had no negative impact on antisepsis. Moreover, data from an ex vivo porcine mucosal infection model suggest a potential benefit when combining the 2 antiseptic agents.
TI  - Epidemiologic, clinical characteristics, and risk factors for adverse outcome in  multiresistant gram-negative primary bacteremia of critically ill patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Characteristics and burden of primary bacteremia because of multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients remain understudied. METHODS: A cohort study of patients with primary MDR GNB-related bacteremia from the ICU of a tertiary Greek hospital during a 3-year period was conducted for recognition of clinical characteristics and risk factors for adverse outcome. A case-control study was further performed to evaluate risk factors for development of MDR GNB-related primary bacteremia. RESULTS: Fifty monomicrobial episodes of primary bacteremia because of Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 18), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12) were recorded. The presence of diabetes mellitus was the only significant risk factor for development of MDR GNB-related primary bacteremia. Most episodes (78%) were ICU acquired in patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation and previous hospitalization in the ward. Mortality was 47.6% vs 19% of controls, P = .01. Mortality was higher in recurrent bacteremia (62.5%). Mortality was statistically associated with age (P = .002) and degree of multiorgan dysfunction expressed by sequential organ failure assessment score on day of bacteremia documentation (P = .001). CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients with MDR GNB-related primary bacteremia present significant mortality mainly associated with age and multiorgan failure. A baumanii bacteremia confers significant mortality compared with the benign course of K pneumoniae in such settings. Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for development of such episodes, which may, in part, be general ward acquired, underlining the need for expanded vigilance.
TI  - pH-dependent studies reveal an efficient hydroxylation mechanism of the oxygenase component of p-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase.
AB  - p-Hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA) 3-hydroxylase (HPAH) catalyzes the hydroxylation of  HPA at the ortho-position to yield 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate. The enzyme is a flavin-dependent two-component monooxygenase that consists of a reductase component and an oxygenase component (C(2)). C(2) catalyzes the hydroxylation of HPA using oxygen and reduced FMN as co-substrates. To date, the effects of pH on the oxygenation of the two-component monooxygenases have never been reported. Here, we report the reaction kinetics of C(2).FMNH(-) with oxygen at various pH values investigated by stopped-flow and rapid quenched-flow techniques. In the absence of HPA, the rate constant for the formation of C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN ( approximately 1.1 x 10(6) m(-1)s(-1)) was unaffected at pH 6.2-9.9, which indicated that the pK(a) of the enzyme-bound reduced FMN was less than 6.2. The rate constant for the following H(2)O(2) elimination step increased with higher pH, which is consistent with a pK(a) of >9.4. In the presence of HPA, the rate constants for the formation of C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN ( approximately 4.8 x 10(4) m(-1)s(-1)) and the ensuing hydroxylation step (15-17 s(-1)) were not significantly affected by the pH. In contrast, the following steps of C4a-hydroxy-FMN dehydration to form oxidized FMN occurred through two pathways that were dependent on the pH of the reaction. One pathway, dominant at low pH, allowed the detection of a C4a-hydroxy-FMN intermediate, whereas the pathway dominant at high pH produced oxidized FMN without an apparent accumulation of the intermediate. However, both pathways efficiently catalyzed hydroxylation without generating significant amounts of wasteful H(2)O(2) at pH 6.2-9.9. The decreased accumulation of the intermediate at higher pH was due to the greater rates of C4a-hydroxy-FMN decay caused by the abolishment of substrate inhibition in the dehydration step at high pH.
TI  - Aerosolized plus intravenous colistin versus intravenous colistin alone for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a matched case-control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms is increasing. Intravenous (IV) colistin or aerosolized (AS) plus IV colistin have been recently used to treat these life-threatening infections. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of AS plus IV colistin versus IV colistin alone for patients with MDR VAP due to gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective matched case-control study was performed at the Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Greece, from January 2005 through December 2008. Forty-three patients with VAP due gram-negative MDR pathogens received AS plus IV colistin and were matched on the basis of age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score with 43 control patients who had received IV colistin alone. RESULTS: Demographic characteristics, clinical status, and gram-negative isolated pathogens were similar between the 2 treatment groups. Acinetobacter baumannii (66 cases [77%]) was the most common pathogen, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (12 cases [14%]) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 cases [9.3%]). No colistin-resistant strains were isolated from patients in either group. No significant differences between the 2 groups were observed regarding eradication of pathogens (P = .679), clinical cure (P = .10), and mortality (P = .289). Eight patients (19%) in each treatment group developed reversible renal dysfunction. No AS colistin-related adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of AS colistin to IV colistin did not provide additional therapeutic benefit to patients with MDR VAP due to gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - New vector tools with a hygromycin resistance marker for use with opportunistic pathogens.
AB  - The ability of many bacterial strains to tolerate antibiotics can limit the number of molecular tools available for research of these organisms. To help address this problem, we have modified a diverse set of vectors to include a broadly expressed hygromycin resistance (HmR) marker. Hygromycin B is an aminoglycoside antibiotic not used to treat infections in humans and has antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms. Vectors with four replication origins are represented, with potential applications including general cloning, allelic replacement, and transcriptional analysis. We show that vectors with the broad host range pBBR1-replicon conferred HmR to Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, and a pC194-based vector was able to confer HmR to Francisella tularensis. We also used a subset of these plasmids to manipulate the genome of S. marcescens. Each vector has an origin of transfer for conjugation, and is also able to replicate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to take advantage of the powerful yeast recombineering system.
TI  - Progress and challenges in implementing the research on ESKAPE pathogens.
AB  - The ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. Over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. However, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. In addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. The difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.
TI  - The impact of fluoroquinolones use on antibiotic resistance in an intensive care  burn department.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones (FQ) use has been identified as a risk factor for colonization and infection to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosae multiresistant(PMR), Acinetobacter multiresistant (AMR) and multidrug resistant bacteria(MDRB). AIM: Our study proposes to measure the annual antibiotic use of FQ and antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and A. baumannii in an intensive care burn unit. METHODS: The study was conducted during a 4 year period (1 January 2000 to 31 December 2003). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method as recommended by the French Society of Microbiology. The consumption of the following antibiotics: ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin was expressed as the antimicrobial use density (AD) taking into account the quantity of antibiotics in Grams converted to defined daily doses (DDD) and the number of day hospitalization. Statistical significance was defined as p value < 0. 0 5 for the corresponding correlation coefficient. RESULTS: There were statistically significant relationship between use of ciprofloxacin and resistance in P. aeruginosa to this drug (rs=0. 95, p<0. 05). Moreover, the ciprofloxacin consumption was correlated with resistance to imipenem (rs=0. 95, p<0. 05) and ceftazidime (rs=0. 95, p<0. 05) in P. aeruginosa . A restriction use of ciprofloxacin has been taken during 2003, it is followed by a significant decrease of resistance to imipenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin in P. aeruginosa (p<0, 05 ). The use of fluoroquinolones was correlated significantly with MRSA (rs=0. 96, P<0. 05) . The restriction use of FQ was significantly associated with a decrease of MRSA. The consumption of ciprofloxacin was also correlated (P<0. 05) with resistance of ceftazidime in K. pneumoniae. However, there is not a correlation (P> 0. 05) between fluoroquinolones use and resistance in A. baumannii as well in ciprofloxacin, imipenem and ceftazidime. CONCLUSION: Our study illustrates the pressure of selection of fluoroquinolones use in the development of MDRB. The use and or the duration of treatment with theses antibiotics should be rationalised as part of efforts to control the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria.
TI  - Randomized controlled trial of nebulized colistimethate sodium as adjunctive therapy of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are common in hospitalized patients at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Parenteral colistimethate sodium (CMS) has been used for therapy of VAP caused by MDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa at Siriraj Hospital over the past few years, with modest favourable outcomes. Objectives To determine whether nebulized CMS as adjunctive therapy of Gram-negative VAP was safe and beneficial. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled study in 100 adults who developed Gram-negative VAP (clinical trial registration number: NCT00920270). All patients received systemic antibiotics according to the decisions of their responsible physicians. The patients were randomized to receive an additional 4 mL of nebulized sterile normal saline (NSS) (n = 49) or nebulized CMS equivalent to 75 mg of colistin base in 4 mL of NSS (n = 51) every 12 h until systemic antibiotic therapy of VAP was ended. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of the patients and conventional therapy of VAP in both groups were comparable. Most of the cases of VAP were caused by MDR A. baumannii and/or P. aeruginosa. All isolates of Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to colistin. Favourable clinical outcome was 51.0% in the CMS group and 53.1% in the control group (P = 0.84). Patients in the CMS group had significantly more favourable microbiological outcome when compared with patients in the control group (60.9% versus 38.2%, P = 0.03). Bronchospasm was observed in 7.8% of patients in the CMS group and in 2.0% of patients in the control group (P = 0.36). Renal impairment was observed in 25.5% of patients in the CMS group and in 22.4% of patients in the NSS group (P = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Nebulized CMS as adjunctive therapy of Gram-negative VAP seems to be safe. However, a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes of adjunctive nebulized CMS for therapy of Gram-negative VAP was not ascertained.
TI  - Structure-activity studies on novel polymyxin derivatives that carry only three positive charges.
AB  - Polymyxin B and colistin are pentacationic lipopeptides that possess a cyclic heptapeptide portion, a linear tripeptide portion, and a fatty acyl tail. They are used, in spite of nephrotoxicity, to treat infections caused by extremely multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria. We have recently developed novel derivatives, that carry three cationic charges only. Some of them, including NAB739, are directly antibacterial whereas others, including NAB7061, lack the direct activity but sensitize bacteria to other antibiotics. NAB739 and NAB7061 differ from the old polymyxins in their renal handling and have reduced affinity to kidney brush border membrane. To further study the structure-activity relationships, we here synthesized eight additional derivatives and tested their antibacterial activity. NAB751 carries methylheptanoyl as the fatty acyl instead of octanoyl in NAB739 and was as active as NAB739, whereas NAB750 with dodecanoyl was less active. NAB781 and NAB782 with the linear peptide portion Ser-DSer and Ser-Ser-DSer, respectively, were less active than NAB739 that carries Thr-DSer. NAB771 with Thr at position 8 in the cyclic portion (instead of Dab in NAB7061) and Thr-Dab as the linear peptide portion (instead of Thr-Abu in NAB7061), resembled NAB7061 in its activity. However, replacement of two Dab residues in the cyclic portion with Thr greatly decreased the activity, even though the loss of the cationic charges was compensated by introducing two Dab residues in the linear portion. These findings reveal that subtle structural modifications have a major effect on the antibacterial activity and that it is possible to design numerous tricationic polymyxin derivatives that are antibacterial.
TI  - Activity of BAL30376 (monobactam BAL19764 + BAL29880 + clavulanate) versus Gram-negative bacteria with characterized resistance mechanisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: BAL30376 combines the siderophore monobactam BAL19764 (Syn/PTX 2416)  with the bridged monobactam BAL29880 to inhibit AmpC enzymes and with clavulanate to inhibit extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). We tested BAL30376 and its components versus isolates and laboratory strains of Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters. METHODS: MICs were determined on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 2,2'-bipyridyl to chelate Fe(3+) and induce TonB-mediated uptake. RESULTS: Unprotected BAL19764 had MICs </= 1 mg/L for most cephalosporin-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae, but values for a few isolates ranged up to 8 mg/L; its MICs were substantially raised for isolates with AmpC beta-lactamases and ESBLs. Those of BAL30376 were </= 1 mg/L for 84% of ESBL producers and </= 4 mg/L for 85% of AmpC producers, excluding isolates with exceptional impermeability. Laboratory transformants with metallo- or OXA-48 carbapenemases were susceptible to unprotected BAL19764, but many clinical isolates with these enzymes were resistant, probably having additional mechanisms; BAL30376, by contrast, was active at 4 mg/L versus 31/35 metallo-beta-lactamase producers and 14/19 with OXA-48, although those with KPC carbapenemases were resistant. AmpC-mediated resistance to BAL19764 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was overcome by BAL30376, as was that due to PER-1 enzyme; but MICs > 16 mg/L were frequent for cystic fibrosis isolates. Many Burkholderia cepacia and carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii were susceptible to BAL19764 and BAL30376 at </= 4 mg/L, but others were highly resistant, with MICs >/= 128 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: BAL30376 overcomes most AmpC-, ESBL- and carbapenemase-mediated resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, though strains with KPC carbapenemases are resistant. It was active against many problem non-fermenters, though resistance was common in P. aeruginosa from cystic fibrosis. Raised MICs for some isolates were independent of beta-lactamase.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activities of Illicium verum against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - In recent years, human pathogenic microorganisms have developed multiple drug resistance and caused serious nosocomial infections. In this study, we identified four new antimicrobial compounds from the Chinese herbal medicine Illicium verum and assessed their antibacterial efficacies. The supercritical CO(2) and ethanol extracts of Illicium verum showed substantial antibacterial activity against 67 clinical drug-resistant isolates, including 27 Acinetobacter baumannii, 20 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 20 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The diethyl ether (EE) fraction obtained from partition extraction and supercritical CO(2) extracts revealed an antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration value of 0.15-0.70 mg/mL and 0.11 mg/mL, respectively. The EE fraction of I. verum showed synergetic effects with some commercial antibiotics. The antimicrobial mechanism was investigated with killing curves and scanning electron microscopy observation. The chemical components of the extracts were analyzed by spectrophotometry; (E)-anethole, anisyl acetone, anisyl alcohol, and anisyl aldehyde exhibited antibacterial activity against different clinical isolates. These extracts from I. verum can be further developed into antibiotic medicines due to their proven antibacterial activity.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and crystal structures of 6-alkylidene-2'-substituted penicillanic acid sulfones as potent inhibitors of Acinetobacter baumannii OXA-24 carbapenemase.
AB  - Class D beta-lactamases represent a growing and diverse class of penicillin-inactivating enzymes that are usually resistant to commercial beta-lactamase inhibitors. As many such enzymes are found in multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, novel beta-lactamase inhibitors are urgently needed. Five unique 6-alkylidene-2'-substituted penicillanic acid sulfones (1-5) were synthesized and tested against OXA-24, a clinically important beta-lactamase that inactivates carbapenems and is found in A. baumannii. Based upon the roles Tyr112 and Met223 play in the OXA-24 beta-lactamase, we also engineered two variants (Tyr112Ala and Tyr112Ala,Met223Ala) to test the hypothesis that the hydrophobic tunnel formed by these residues influences inhibitor recognition. IC(50) values against OXA-24 and two OXA-24 beta-lactamase variants ranged from 10 +/- 1 (4 vs WT) to 338 +/- 20 nM (5 vs Tyr112Ala, Met223Ala). Compound 4 possessed the lowest K(i) (500 +/- 80 nM vs WT), and 1 possessed the highest inactivation efficiency (k(inact)/K(i) = 0.21 +/- 0.02 muM(-1) s(-1)). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed a single covalent adduct, suggesting the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. X-ray structures of OXA-24 complexed to four inhibitors (2.0-2.6 A) reveal the formation of stable bicyclic aromatic intermediates with their carbonyl oxygen in the oxyanion hole. These data provide the first structural evidence that 6-alkylidene-2'-substituted penicillin sulfones are effective mechanism-based inactivators of class D beta-lactamases. Their unique chemistry makes them developmental candidates. Mechanisms for class D hydrolysis and inhibition are discussed, and a pathway for the evolution of the BlaR1 sensor of Staphylococcus aureus to the class D beta-lactamases is proposed.
TI  - Empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with an aggressive de-escalation strategy does not induce gram-negative pathogen resistance in ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early, empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotics followed by de-escalation  to pathogen-specific therapy is the standard of care for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). In our surgical intensive care unit (SICU), imipenem-cilastatin (I-C) in combination with tobramycin (TOB) or levofloxacin (LEV) has been used until quantitative bronchoalveolar lavage results are finalized, at which time de-escalation occurs to pathogen-specific agents. With this practice, however, alterations in antimicrobial resistance remain a concern. Our hypothesis was that this strict regimen does not alter antimicrobial susceptibility of common gram-negative VAP pathogens in our SICU. METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval, a retrospective review of SICU-specific antibiograms was performed for the sensitivities of common gram-negative VAP pathogens. Time periods were defined as early (January-June 2005) and late (July-December 2006). Chart review of empiric and de-escalation antibiotic usage was obtained. Data were collated, and statistical significance was assessed with the chi-square test using the on-line Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis tool. RESULTS: Imipenem-cilastatin was used 198 times for empiric VAP coverage (811 patient-days), whereas TOB and LEV were given a total of 149 (564 patient-days) and 61 (320 patient-days) times, respectively. Collectively, the susceptibility of gram-negative organisms to I-C did not change (early 91.4%; late 97%; p = 0.33). Individually, non-significant trends to greater sensitivity to I-C were noted for both Pseudomonas aeruginosa (early 85.7%; late 90.9%; p = 0.73) and Acinetobacter baumannii (early 80%; late 100%; p = 0.13). Further, both TOB (early 77.1%; late 70.0%; p = 0.49) and LEV (early 74.3%; late 70.0%; p = 0.67) were found to maintain their susceptibility profiles. The frequency of resistant gram-positive VAPs was unchanged during the study period. Our de-escalation compliance (by 96 h) was 78% for I-C, 77.2% for TOB, and 59% for LEV. When infections requiring I-C were removed from the analysis, de-escalation compliance was improved to 92%. CONCLUSIONS: In our SICU, early, empiric broad-spectrum VAP therapy followed by de-escalation to pathogen-specific agents did not alter antimicrobial resistance and is a valid practice. Further, our compliance with de-escalation practices was higher than published rates.
TI  - Wound contraction effects and antibacterial properties of Tualang honey on full-thickness burn wounds in rats in comparison to hydrofibre.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Full-thickness burn wounds require excision and skin grafting. Multiple surgical procedures are inevitable in managing moderate to severe full-thickness burns. Wound bed preparations prior to surgery are necessary in order to prevent wound infection and promote wound healing. Honey can be used to treat burn wounds. However, not all the honey is the same. This study aims to evaluate the wound contraction and antibacterial properties of locally-produced Tualang honey on managing full-thickness burn wounds in vivo. METHODS: Thirty-six female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups. Under anaesthesia, three full-thickness burn wounds were created on the dorsum of the rats. The full-thickness burn wounds were inoculated with a specific organism (10(4)), namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 12), or Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12). The three burn wounds were dressed with Tualang honey, hydrofibre and hydrofibre silver respectively. Swab samples were obtained every 3 days (day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21) for quantitative and semi-quantitative microbiological analyses. Clinical assessments, including observations concerning the appearance and wound size, were measured at the same time. RESULTS: There was a rapid 32.26% reduction in wound size by day 6 (p = 0.008) in the Tualang honey-treated wounds, and 49.27% by day 15 (p = 0.005). The wounds remained smaller by day 18 (p < 0.032). Tualang honey-treated rats demonstrated a reduction in bacterial growth in Pseudomonas aeruginosa inoculated wounds (p = 0.005). However, hydrofibre silver and hydrofibre-treated wounds are superior to honey-treated wounds with Acinetobacter baumannii (p = 0.035). There was no statistical significant of antibacterial property in Klebsiella pneumonia inoculated wounds. CONCLUSIONS: Tualang honey has better results with regards to its control of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its wound contraction effects on full-thickness burn wound in vivo.
TI  - Synthesis and spectrum of the neoglycoside ACHN-490.
AB  - ACHN-490 is a neoglycoside, or "next-generation" aminoglycoside (AG), that has been identified as a potentially useful agent to combat drug-resistant bacteria emerging in hospitals and health care facilities around the world. A focused medicinal chemistry campaign produced a collection of over 400 sisomicin analogs from which ACHN-490 was selected. We tested ACHN-490 against two panels of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, many of which harbored AG resistance mechanisms. Unlike legacy AGs, ACHN-490 was active against strains expressing known AG-modifying enzymes, including the three most common such enzymes found in Enterobacteriaceae. ACHN-490 inhibited the growth of AG-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MIC(90), </=4 mug/ml), with the exception of Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteae (MIC(90), 8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively). ACHN-490 was more active alone in vitro against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates with AG-modifying enzymes than against those with altered permeability/efflux. The MIC(90) of ACHN-490 against AG-resistant staphylococci was 2 mug/ml. Due to its promising in vitro and in vivo profiles, ACHN-490 has been advanced into clinical development as a new antibacterial agent.
TI  - Sensitization of microcin J25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
AB  - Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by Escherichia coli. MccJ25 inhibits RNA polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. MccJ25 uptake into E. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor FhuA and the inner membrane proteins TonB, ExbB, ExbD, and SbmA. This peptide is active on some E. coli, Salmonella, and Shigella species strains, while other Gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, are completely resistant. In the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (KFF)(3)K made some resistant strains sensitive to MccJ25, among them S. Typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. The results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (KFF)(3)K allows MccJ25 penetration in an FhuA and SbmA-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic Salmonella strains.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime+NXL104 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other  non-fermenters.
AB  - BACKGROUND: NXL104 potentiates ceftazidime and ceftaroline against Enterobacteriaceae with extended-spectrum, AmpC, KPC and OXA beta-lactamases. We examined whether similar potentiation was obtained against non-fermenters, which are less permeable than Enterobacteriaceae and have more potent efflux. METHODS: MICs of ceftazidime+NXL104 (with NXL104 at 4 mg/L) and comparators were determined by CLSI agar dilution for: (i) Pseudomonas aeruginosa AmpC mutants and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing transconjugants; (ii) clinical P. aeruginosa isolates with AmpC enzymes, ESBLs or up-regulated efflux; (iii) P. aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex isolates from cystic fibrosis patients; and (iv) Acinetobacter baumannii with OXA carbapenemases, which also compromise ceftazidime. RESULTS: NXL104 reversed AmpC-mediated ceftazidime resistance in P. aeruginosa, reducing MICs for fully derepressed mutants and isolates to </= 8 mg/L. NXL104 also reversed ceftazidime resistance caused by the ESBL PER-1, but not that due to OXA ESBLs or VEB-1 enzyme. Efflux-mediated resistance was unaffected. Resistance to ceftazidime in isolates of P. aeruginosa and the B. cepacia complex from patients with cystic fibrosis was variably overcome, generally to greater effect for B. cepacia. NXL104 had little effect on MICs of ceftazidime for A. baumannii isolates with OXA carbapenemases. CONCLUSIONS: The potentiation of ceftazidime against many beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia complex strains confirms that NXL104 penetrates these organisms. The utility of the combination against these pathogens will depend on the local prevalence of strains with beta-lactamase- versus efflux-mediated resistance. The lack of potentiation against A. baumannii may reflect failure of NXL104 to penetrate these bacteria to inhibit relevant (OXA-23, -40, -51 and -58) carbapenemases.
TI  - Suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel as an antiseptic dressing: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of burn wounds is still a challenge regarding the management of antiseptic wound conditioning. Especially, in the United States, silver-containing dressings, such as Acticoat and Aquacel are frequently used. Because silver-containing dressings have well-known drawbacks such as an antimicrobial lack against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we sought to develop an alternative dressing method. In previous studies, we could demonstrate the excellent antiseptic properties of acetic acid against common burn unit germs, and in another study, the feasibility and suitability of a Suprathel-acetic acid matrix as an antiseptic dressing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a Suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus Acticoat and Aquacel. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: The tests showed an excellent bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-acetic acid matrix particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The efficiency was superior to that of Acicoat and Aquacel. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the notion, that the Suprathel-acetic acid matrix has an excellent bactericidal effect and therefore seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent in the treatment of burn wounds.
TI  - Treatment of recurrent Stenotrophomonas maltophilia ventilator-associated pneumonia with doxycycline and aerosolized colistin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of recurrent Stenotrophomonas maltophilia ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) that was successfully treated with doxycycline and aerosolized colistin. CASE SUMMARY: A 28-year-old male was admitted with a severe head injury and required mechanical ventilation. The patient developed S. maltophilia VAP on hospital day 17, which was cured after 7 days of treatment with high-dose intravenous trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). However, on day 34, the patient developed recurrent S. maltophilia VAP that did not respond clinically or demonstrate eradication on follow-up culture after 10 days of TMP/SMX. At that time, TMP/SMX was discontinued and treatment was initiated with intravenous doxycycline and aerosolized colistin. The VAP episode was cured after 14 days of treatment with doxycycline/aerosolized colistin. DISCUSSION: S. maltophilia is an emerging cause of VAP in some centers. This organism is associated with high mortality rates and has few treatment options because it is intrinsically resistant to most drug classes. Recent data suggest that doxycycline and aerosolized colistin each are effective in treatment of other multidrug-resistant organisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. However, this is the first report describing the use of this antibiotic regimen for S. maltophilia. High-dose TMP/SMX is considered to be the drug of choice primarily based on excellent in vitro activity. Few data exist on how to treat patients who fail therapy with TMP/SMX or cannot receive that drug because of resistance, allergy, or adverse events. Thus, it is important to report alternative methods for treating this infection. CONCLUSIONS: The positive clinical response to doxycycline and aerosolized colistin seen in the patient described here suggests that this combination may be an alternative treatment in patients who fail initial treatment or cannot receive standard therapies.
TI  - [Formation of bacterial biofilm on deep vein catheters in burn patients and its significance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the biofilm (BF) formation of Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) on the surface of deep vein catheters in burn patients after infection. METHODS: The bacteria from deep vein catheters in 20 patients hospitalized from November 2008 to August 2009 were isolated, and were compared with their respective standard stains. Catheters tips were examined with scanning electron microscope (SEM). The semi-quantitative adhesion assay of bacterial BF was performed with modified microtiter-plate test, and the thickness of BF was scanned and measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) after double fluorescence staining, after being cultured in vitro for 12, 24, 48, 72 hours and 5 days, respectively. Data were processed with grouped t test. RESULTS: Six strains of SA, 8 strains of AB, and 6 strains of PA, all drug resistant, were isolated from the deep vein catheters. SEM showed that the BF structures on the inner surfaces of catheters were in diverse in their shape and degree, characterized by adherence and flake formation, and embedded in polysaccharide matrix. BF gathered in clusters, forming three-dimensional structure, in which small amount of red blood cells were found. A small number of bacteria were incompletely embedded, with some bacteria adhered to them. The absorbance values for SA after 24, 48 and 72 hours of culture (PCH) were above the cut-off value, the same for AB at PCH 12, 24, 48 and 72, and PA after PCH 48. Except for PA standard strain, CLSM showed scattered green fluorescence, mainly close to the bottom of plate, while the red fluorescence was observed in full scope at PCH 24 for each strain. At PCH 48 green fluorescence increased obviously and extended upward from the bottom, overlapping partly with red fluorescence, forming yellow fluorescence, and among the bacteria it was most obvious in AB culture, with SA the next. Compared with those of the standard stains, the intensity and quantity of fluorescence from the clinical strains were stronger; at PCH 72 the green fluorescence increased obviously especially for PA and its standard strain, while the yellow fluorescence was full of the scope for other strains. On in vitro culture day 5, the green fluorescence was dispersed and was obvious on the bottom of the plate. BF mature time for AB and SA was PCH 48, and for PA was PCH 72. The BF thickness of AB was (18.2 +/- 3.6) microm at PCH 72, which was thicker than that [(9.4 +/- 2.6) microm] of its standard strain (t = 5.42, P < 0.05), and was also the thickest among the three clinically found strains. CONCLUSIONS: SA, AB and PA, which are commonly found bacteria in burn patients, can form BF in deep vein catheters. Their ability to form BF seems to be stronger than other usually pathogenic strains, especially AB, which is the important pathogen leading to catheter related infection.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative isolates in an adult intensive care unit at a tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients in the ICU have encountered an increasing emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. We examined patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility in gram-negative isolates to commonly used drugs in an adult ICU at a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out of gram-negative isolates from the adult ICU of King Fahad National Guard Hospital (KFNGH) between 2004 and 2009. Organisms were identified and tested by an automated identification and susceptibility system, and the antibiotic susceptibility testing was confirmed by the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: The most frequently isolated organism was Acinetobacter baumannii, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pnemoniae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Enterobacter. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns significantly declined in many organisms, especially A baumannii, E coli, S marcescens, and Enterobacter. A baumannii susceptibility was significantly decreased to imipenem (55% to 10%), meropenem (33% to 10%), ciprofloxacin (22% to 10%), and amikacin (12% to 6%). E coli susceptibility was markedly decreased (from 75% to 50% or less) to cefuroxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefepime. S marcescens susceptibility was markedly decreased to cefotaxime (100% to 32%), ceftazidime (100% to 35%), and cefepime (100% to 66%). Enterobacter susceptibility was markedly decreased to ceftazidime (34% to 5%), cefotaxime (34% to 6%), and pipracillin-tazobactam (51% to 35%). Respiratory samples were the most frequently indicative of multidrug-resistant pathogens (63%), followed by urinary samples (57%). CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging problem in the KFNGH ICU, justifying new more stringent antibiotic prescription guidelines. Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility and strict adherence to infection prevention guidelines are essential to eliminate major outbreaks in the future.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico: special focus on Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of Acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico over a 3-year period. Clinical isolates of A. baumannii (n = 550), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some Enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. Susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of A. baumannii, 40% of Escherichia coli, 34% of P. aeruginosa, 22% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of Enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of Serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of A. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. A. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. Species from Enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and Serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. For P. aeruginosa, the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. With regard to S. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). The high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.
TI  - Point prevalence surveys of healthcare-associated infection in 13 hospitals in Hubei Province, China, 2007-2008.
AB  - Successive point prevalence surveys were conducted in November 2007 and 2008 to monitor the prevalence of healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) in 13 grade III, 1st class hospitals in Hubei Province of China, using the case definition criteria established by the Ministry of Health in the People's Republic of China. In total, of 20 350 patients surveyed, 833 (4.09%) HCAIs were observed in 790 (3.88%) patients. There was no significant difference between the overall prevalence of HCAI in 2007 (4.14%) and 2008 (3.72%). Respiratory tract infection was the most common HCAI (63.15%), followed by surgical site infection (9.60%) and urinary tract infection (8.64%). Only 35.29% (294/833) of HCAI patients had positive microbiology results. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated most frequently and the most frequent organism was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic use was documented for 10,344 (50.83%) patients, and cephalosporins, penicillins, and quinolones were the most commonly used agents for treatment or prophylaxis.
TI  - Influence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance on adult in-hospital mortality from post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features, etiology and predictors of in-hospital mortality in adults with post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 60 adult patients with culture-proven post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis hospitalized between September 2006 and August 2008. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, 88.3% had monomicrobial infection and 11.7% had mixed infection. The mean duration from the first neurosurgical procedure to the diagnosis of meningitis was 21 days (range, 1-134 days). The median frequency of neurosurgical procedure before meningitis was 1 (range, 1-5). A total of 69 isolates were identified from the cerebrospinal fluid, the most common pathogens were Gram-negative bacilli (43, 62.3%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (24, 34.8%). The three most common Gram-negative bacilli were Serratia marcescens (7, 10.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (4, 5.8%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates comprised less than 3%. Notably, glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli other than Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. accounted for 11.6% of the total. Of the Gram-negative bacilli, resistance rates to the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, were 58.1% and 34.9%, respectively. The two most common Gram-positive pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (10, 14.5%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (including S. epidermidis) (10, 14.5%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 15.0%, which was significantly related to Gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio = 33.65; p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: These findings may portend the spread of serious resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli throughout the neurosurgical units, suggestive of the need to reassess the empirical use of third-generation cephalosporins in post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Overview perspective of bacterial resistance.
AB  - The rapidly escalating prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. This reduced susceptibility to currently available antimicrobial agents coupled with the progressive shortage of newly approved compounds is a worrisome situation. Major problems are encountered for a growing number of Gram-positive (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp.) and Gram-negative pathogens (i.e., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae). We provide an overview of bacterial resistance focusing on the most common pathogens responsible for infection in both the community and healthcare settings. In addition, several strategies to curb antimicrobial resistance are also discussed. It is increasingly evident that without the introduction of novel antimicrobial agents, a return to the clinical outcomes associated with the pre-antibiotic era are inevitable.
TI  - [Epidemiological features of multidrug resistant bacteria isolated from urine samples at the Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital in Rabat, Morocco].
AB  - Hospital-acquired multidrug resistant bacteria infections are a serious public health issue causing increased morbidity, mortality and care cost. These risks underscore the need for health care institutions to maintain active panels to monitor, prevent, and manage hospital-acquired infections. The purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiology of urinary tract infection involving multidrug resistant bacteria at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Mohammed-V Military Teaching Hospital in Rabat. Study was carried out retrospectively on bacteria isolated from 10,243 urinary samples collected from January 1 to December 31, 2008. A total of 1,439 non-redundant bacteria (14.1%) meeting the criteria of urinary infection were identified. One hundred and three of the 1,439 bacteria isolated (7%) were multidrug resistant. Multidrug-resistant bacteria were more common in in-patients (63.1%). Mean patient age was 53.8 +/- 18.2 and the M/F sex ratio was 2.2. The most common multi-drug resistant bacteria were Enterobacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase (54.4% including 40.8% of Klebsiella pneumonia) and non-fermenting bacteria (45.6% including 26.2% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. and 19.4% of Acinetobacter baumannii. These bacteria were resistant to the most commonly used antibiotics but remained highly sensitive to colistin, imipenem and amikacin.
TI  - Inhaled colistin for the treatment of tracheobronchitis and pneumonia in critically ill children without cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Data regarding the role of inhaled colistin in critically ill pediatric patients  without cystic fibrosis are scarce. Three children (one female), admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary-care pediatric hospital in Athens, Greece, during 2004-2009 received inhaled colistin as monotherapy for tracheobronchitis (two children), and as adjunctive therapy for necrotizing pneumonia (one child). Colistin susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the cases' bronchial secretions specimens. All three children received inhaled colistin at a dosage of 75 mg diluted in 3 ml of normal saline twice daily (1,875,000 IU of colistin daily), for a duration of 25, 32, and 15 days, respectively. All three children recovered from the infections. Also, a gradual reduction, and finally total elimination of the microbial load in bronchial secretions was observed during inhaled colistin treatment in the reported cases. All three cases were discharged from the ICU. No bronchoconstriction or any other type of toxicity of colistin was observed. In conclusion, inhaled colistin was effective and safe for the treatment of two children with tracheobronchitis, and one child with necrotizing pneumonia. Further studies are needed to clarify further the role of inhaled colistin in pediatric critically ill patients without cystic fibrosis.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Evaluation of Vitek2 and BD Phoenix in antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Vitek2 and BD Phoenix against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was evaluated. Both systems showed overall categoric agreement of < or =90% for cefepime and ceftazidime against A. baumannii and imipenem and cefepime (and ceftazidime with Vitek2) against P. aeruginosa because of high minor error rates.
TI  - Distribution of 16S rRNA methylases among different species of Gram-negative bacilli with high-level resistance to aminoglycosides.
AB  - 16S rRNA methylases confer high-level resistance to most aminoglycosides in Gram-negative bacteria. Seven 16S rRNA methylase genes, armA, rmtA, rmtB, rmtC, rmtD, rmtE and npmA, have been identified since 2003. We studied the distribution of methylase genes in more than 200 aminoglycoside-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates collected in 2007 at our hospital in Shanghai, China. 16S rRNA methylase genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) among 217 consecutive clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli resistant to gentamicin and amikacin by a disk diffusion method. 16S rRNA methylase genes were present in 97.5% (193/198) of clinical isolates highly resistant to amikacin (>/=512 mug/ml), with armA and rmtB detected in 67.2 and 30.3% of strains, respectively, while no 16S rRNA methylase genes were detected in 19 strains with amikacin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) </=256 mug/ml. armA or rmtB genes were detected in 100% of 104 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, and these two genes were equally represented (49 vs. 55 strains). Genes for armA or rmtB were detected in 94.7% (89/94) of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, and armA was predominant (84 vs. 5 strains with rmtB). No rmtA, rmtC, rmtD or npmA genes were found. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence (ERIC-PCR) indicated that armA and rmtB genes were spread by both horizontal transfer and clonal dissemination.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  - Human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. We determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hBD-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. The native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hBD-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hBD-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. Characteristically, A. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hBD-2 (vLD(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-MDR (wild-type) A. baumannii strains (vLD(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). Bactericidal activity of hBD-2 was less pronounced against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. These observations give indications that the natural hBD-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting MDR phenotypes.
TI  - A study of cytotoxicity of novel chlorokojic acid derivatives with their antimicrobial and antiviral activities.
AB  - A series of 6-chloromethyl-3-hydroxy-2-substituted 4H-pyran-4-one derivatives were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial and antiviral activities. Mannich base derivatives were prepared through the reaction of substituted piperazine or piperidine derivatives on chlorokojic acid and formaline. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR, ESI-MS, and elemental analysis. According to the activity studies, compounds 2-7 (MIC: 1-2 microg/mL) were found to be highly active against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, while compounds 3, 5 and 6 showed significant activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. Also, compounds 2-7 were more remarkably active against Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis (MIC: 4-8 microg/mL). Additionally, compound 2 was the most active one against RNA virus PI-3.
TI  - [Interpretive reading of the non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli antibiogram].
AB  - Among non-fermenting Gram-negative rods, the most clinically important species are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which are frequently multiresistant. P. aeruginosa resistance to beta-lactams depends on the production of chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, altered permeability (loss of OprD porin is related to carbapenem-resistance) and active efflux systems, particularly MexAB-OprM. In aminoglycoside resistant strains, the main mechanism of resistance is the production of modifying enzymes; the efflux pump MexXY-OprM is also involved. Quinolone resistance in P. aeruginosa is related to changes in topoisomerases, altered permeability and efflux pumps. Multiresistance in A. baumannii may be associated with the acquisition of resistant islands carrying different resistant determining factors. Several broad- and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have been shown in this microorganism, however the main mechanism of resistance to betalactams is the hyperproduction of the chromosomal cephalosporinase (AmpC) related to the presence of the ISAba1 in the promoter region of this gene. The main mechanism of resistance to carbapenems is the acquisition of carbapenemases type B (metallo-beta-lactamases) or class D (oxacillinases), however the loss of a porin can also contribute to modulate the final MIC. The resistance to aminoglycosides has been associated with the production of modifying enzymes or the overexpression of efflux pump (AdeABC), whereas the resistance to quinolones is related to changes in the protein targets as well to the overexpression of efflux pump(s). S. maltophilia show resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems due to the production of two beta-lactamases (L-1 and L-2). Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes have also been described in this species. In contrast to that observed in other organisms, S. maltophilia resistance to quinolones has been mainly related to active efflux, rather than to targets alterations.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production of selected gram-negative bacilli from two Croatian hospitals: MYSTIC study results.
AB  - The meropenem yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) programme is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network that monitors the activity of meropenem and compares its activity with other broadspectrum antimicrobial agents. We now report the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents within the selective Gram-negative pathogen groups from two Croatian Hospitals investigated between 2002-2007. A total of 1510 Gram-negative pathogens were tested and the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution method according to CLSI.There was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis in both medical centers. High resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime (18%), cefepime (17%) and gentamicin (39%) are raising concern. Acinetobacter baumannii turned out to be the most resistant Gram-negative bacteria with 81% resistant to ceftazidime, 73% to cefepime, 69% to gentamicin and 71% to ciprofloxacin. Almost 20% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem, 13% to meropenem, 69% to gentamicin and 38% to ciprofloxacin.The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in E. coli was 10% and in K. pneumoniae 49%. PCR and sequencing of the amplicons revealed the presence of SHV-5 in nine E. coli strains and additional tem-1 beta-lactamase five strains. Five K. pneumoniae strains were positive for bla(SHV-5 )gene. Eight ESBL positive Enterobacter spp. strains were found to produce tem and CtX-m beta-lactamases. Plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases were not found among K. pneumoniae, E. coli and Enterobacter spp. Three A. baumannii strains from Zagreb University Center were identified by multiplex PCR as OXA-58 like producers. Six A. baumannii strains from Split University Center were found to possess an ISAba1 insertion sequence upstream of bla(OXA-51 )gene. According to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. These data indicate that despite continued use of meropenem, carbapenem resistance is not increasing among species tested, except for A. Baumannii, in the two study hospitals and suggest that clinicians can still administer carbapenems as a reliable and effective choice in managing serious nosocomial infections.
TI  - Oncocin (VDKPPYLPRPRPPRRIYNR-NH2): a novel antibacterial peptide optimized against gram-negative human pathogens.
AB  - Small proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (AMP) have attracted considerable interest, as they target specific intracellular bacterial components and do not act by lytic mechanisms. Here, a novel peptide, termed oncocin (VDKPPYLPRPRPPRRIYNR-NH(2)), is reported that was optimized for the treatment of Gram-negative pathogens. Its minimal inhibitory concentrations in tryptic soy broth medium ranged from 0.125 to 8 microg/mL for 34 different strains and clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters, such as Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Acinetobacter baumannii . Substitutions of two arginine residues by ornithine increased the half-lives in full mouse serum from about 20 min to greater than 180 min and the activity. Both optimized oncocin derivatives were neither toxic to human cell lines nor hemolytic to human erythrocytes. They could freely penetrate lipid membranes and were washed out completely without any sign of lytic activity, as assessed by quartz crystal microbalance. Fluorescence labeled peptides entered the periplasmic space within 20 min at room temperature and homogeneously stained E. coli within 50 min. In conclusion, the optimized oncocin represents a very promising candidate for future in vivo work and may serve as a novel lead compound for an antibacterial drug class.
TI  - [The genetic description of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from patients with hospital acquired pneumonia hospitalized in intensive care unit].
AB  - The aim of study was to recognize the epidemiology of hospital acquired pneumonia on the base of genotypes of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Gram negative-non fermenting bacilli are the most frequent aetiologic agent of hospital acquired pneumonia among patients from Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit in the Rydygiers hospital in Cracow. In the following research RAPD-PCR method was applied and there 272, 208, ERIC- 2 and PAL- 2 primers were used. The investigation was conducted among 33 Acinetobacter baumannii and 31 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains which were isolated from endotracheal aspirates (ETA). ETA were taken from 19 patients with microbiologically confirmed pneumonia. The result of our study shows that most A. baumannii strains came from hospital habitat. In the investigated group of A. baumannii strains, 31 belonged to 3 clonal groups and probably came from two bacteria subpopulations which were present in ICU from a long time. There were only two isolates which had got the posthospital origin. Moreover, the assay of genetic similarity between A. baumannii strains, isolated from individual patients, showed that only in two patients were observed strains with different genetic profiles. Isolates which came from 8 patients had got the same pattern of bands. There were many genetic differences between investigated P. aeruginosa strains. In the group of 31 isolates, which were investigated by using 208, 272, ERIC- 2 and PAL- 2 primers, recognized respectively 10, 10, 13 and 8 of genetic profiles. All isolates of P. aeruginosa probably came from a few subpopulations of hospital strain which has undergone evolutionary divergence phenomenon in time as a result of changing condition of hospital environment and application of antibiotics. The assay of genotype of P. aeruginosa strains which were repeatedly isolated from individual patients showed that only from two patients strains with 100% genetic homology were isolated.
TI  - [Shall we report the carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains detected by BD Phoenix system?].
AB  - Imipenem and meropenem are broad spectrum antimicrobial agents that are especially useful in the treatment of nosocomially acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. infections. Previous reports have noted that susceptibility tests could show false resistance to imipenem. For this reason, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that all carbapenem resistant or intermediate resistant isolates should be tested with an additional method to verify the results. This study was aimed to evaluate the imipenem and meropenem susceptibilities by disk diffusion, E-test and broth microdilution in P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains found to be resistant or intermediate to imipenem-meropenem by BD Phoenix automated susceptibility testing system. Between January 2006-January 2007, 85 non-duplicate isolates of A. baumannii and 51 non-duplicate isolates of P. aeruginosa which were determined as resistant or intermediate resistant to imipenem and/or meropenem by BD Phoenix automated identification and susceptibility system (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA) were collected in Akdeniz University Hospital Central Laboratory. All strains were tested by E-test (AB Biodisk, Sweden), disk diffusion and reference broth microdilution (BMD) method following CLSI recommendations. All 51 isolates of P. aeruginosa determined as imipenem and/or meropenem resistant or intermediate resistant by BD Phoenix, were found to be imipenem and/or meropenem resistant or intermediate resistant by the reference BMD method. Minor error rates were same for all testing systems (1.9%) except for the meropenem results of BD Phoenix system (5.9%). No major errors were produced by any system. For A. baumannii, only one very major error was detected for meropenem by BD Phoenix system. Number of minor errors determined for meropenem by all testing systems compared to the reference test, ranged from 2 (2.4%) to 3 (3.5%). It was concluded that carbapenem susceptibility test results obtained by BD Phoenix system for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates, could be reported without an additional susceptibility testing method unless indicated on case basis.
TI  - Evaluation of a DNA microarray, the check-points ESBL/KPC array, for rapid detection of TEM, SHV, and CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and KPC carbapenemases.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC carbepenemases) have rapidly emerged worldwide and require rapid identification. The Check-Points ESBL/KPC array, a new commercial system based on genetic profiling for the direct identification of ESBL producers (SHV, TEM, and CTX-M) and of KPC producers, was evaluated. Well-characterized Gram-negative rods (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii) expressing various ss-lactamases (KPC-2, SHV, TEM, and CTX-M types) were used as well as wild-type reference strains and isolates harboring ss-lactamase genes not detected by the assay. In addition, phenotypically confirmed ESBL producers isolated in clinical samples over a 3-month period at the Bicetre hospital were analyzed using the Check-Points ESBL/KPC array and by standard PCR. The Check-Points ESBL/KPC array allowed fast detection of all TEM, SHV, and CTX-M ESBL genes and of the KPC-2 gene. The assay allowed easy differentiation between non-ESBL TEM and SHV and their ESBL derivatives. None of the other tested ss-lactamase genes were detected, underlining its high specificity. The technique is suited for Enterobacteriaceae but also for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. However, for nonfermenters, especially P. aeruginosa, a 1:10 dilution of the total DNA was necessary to detect KPC-2 and SHV-2a genes reliably. The Check-Points ESBL/KPC array is a powerful high-throughput tool for rapid identification of ESBLs and KPC producers in cultures. It provided definitive results within the same working day, allowing rapid implementation of isolation measures and appropriate antibiotic treatment. It showed an interesting potential for routine laboratory testing.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profiling of four antimicrobials against gram-negative bacteria collected from Shenyang, China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To examine common antimicrobial regimens used in eradicating certain  nosocomial gram-negative pathogens and determine which ones are likely to be the most suitable as empirical choices in Shenyang, China. METHODS: A 5000-subject Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to determine the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for meropenem, imipenem, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected in 2006 and 2007 from Shenyang. RESULTS: Meropenem and imipenem had the highest CFRs against the Enterobacteriaceae (97%-100%), followed by cefepime. No antibiotic simulated regimen achieved optimal CFR against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Piperacillin/tazobactam dosed at 4.5 g q8h achieved the lowest CFR against all bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the carbapenems provide the greatest likelihood of clinical success for the Enterobacteriaceae, and combination therapy might be needed when choosing empirical therapy, especially when A. baumannii or P. aeruginosa are suspected.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia: role of colonizers and value of routine endotracheal aspirate cultures.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the role of colonizers in the causation of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the value of routine pre-VAP endotracheal aspirate (EA) cultures in appropriately treating VAP. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted over a period of 15 months. Two hundred patients on mechanical ventilation for>48h were studied. RESULTS: Acinetobacter spp (33.7%) and Pseudomonas spp (29.8%) were the most common colonizers. Of the 200 patients, 36 developed VAP. In 20 VAP patients, the pre-VAP EA culture-based strategy was not useful. However, in the remaining 16 VAP patients, a pre-VAP EA culture-based strategy would have appropriately treated 13 (81%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 62-100%), in comparison to only nine (56%; 95% CI 32-80%) by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) strategy. The seven patients in whom the ATS guidelines were inappropriate had Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas spp resistant to the higher antibiotics recommended by the ATS for multidrug-resistant pathogens. The positive predictive values of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from pre-VAP EA cultures were 88%, 83%, and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: VAP patients should be treated based on ATS guidelines, but whenever P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and MRSA are isolated from pre-VAP EA cultures, the initial antibiotic therapy should be extended to treat these.
TI  - Role of intensive care unit environment and health-care workers in transmission of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii have been reported to cause outbreaks of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in several studies. The high prevalence of these pathogens prompted us to study the different strains of these pathogens prevailing in our intensive care units (ICUs) and determine the role of ICU environment and health-care workers (HCWs) in the transmission of infection. METHODOLOGY: A prospective study was performed over a period of 15 months in two ICUs of Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Pondicherry, India. Surveillance samples were collected from the HCWs and the ICU environment. Quantitative antibiogram typing and PCR-RFLP were used for comparison of the isolates from the surveillance samples and VAP patients. RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were the most common potential VAP pathogens isolated from the surveillance cultures. Eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were present in our ICUs, but multi-drug resistant (MDR) strain 2 and strain 4 were the most prevalent strains. Six strains of Acinetobacter baumannii were found in our ICUs, of which MDR strain 1 and strain 3 were the most common. The strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii observed in the VAP patients were also found in the ICU milieu. Only one HCW was found to be the carrier of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain present in a VAP patient. CONCLUSIONS: The ICU environment was observed to be the potential reservoir for VAP pathogens; therefore, strict adherence to environmental infection control measures is essential to prevent health-care-associated infections.
TI  - Resistance to cephalosporins and carbapenems in Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.
AB  - During the past 15 years, emergence and dissemination of beta-lactam resistance in nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, became a serious problem worldwide. Especially the increasing resistance to 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins and carbapenems is of particular concern. Gram-negative bacteria pursue various molecular strategies for development of resistance to these antibiotics: (a) generation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) according to the original definition due to extension of the spectrum of already widely disseminated plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases by amino acid substitution; (b) acquisition of genes encoding ESBL from environmental bacteria as, for instance the CTX-M-type beta-lactamases from Kluyvera spp.; (c) high-level expression of chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase (bla) genes as bla(OXA) or bla(ampC) genes due to modifications in regulatory genes, mutations of the beta-lactamase promoter sequence as well as integration of insertion sequences containing an efficient promoter for intrinsic bla genes; (d) mobilization of bla genes by incorporation in integrons and horizontal transfer into other Gram-negative species such as the transfer of the ampC gene from Citrobacter freundii to Klebsiella spp.; (e) dissemination of plasmid-mediated carbapenemases as KPC and metallo-beta-lactamases, e.g. VIM and IMP; (f) non-expression of porin genes and/or efflux pump-based antibiotic resistance. This mini-review summarizes the historical emergence of beta-lactam resistance and beta-lactamases as major resistance mechanism in enteric bacteria, and also highlights recent developments such as multidrug- and carbapenem resistance.
TI  - The impact of fluoroquinolones use on antibiotic resistance in an intensive care  burn department.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones (FQ) use has been identified as a risk factor for colonization and infection to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosae multiresistant(PMR) , Acinetobacter multiresistant (AMR) and multidrug resistant bacteria(MDRB). AIM: Our study proposes to measure the annual antibiotic use of FQ and antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and A. baumannii in an intensive care burn unit. METHODS: The study was conducted during a 4 year period (1 January 2000 to 31 December 2003). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method as recommended by the French Society of Microbiology. The consumption of the following antibiotics: ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin was expressed as the antimicrobial use density (AD) taking into account the quantity of antibiotics in Grams converted to defined daily doses (DDD) and the number of day hospitalization. Statistical significance was defined as p value < 0.05 for the corresponding correlation coefficient. RESULTS: There were statistically significant relationship between use of ciprofloxacin and resistance in P. aeruginosa to this drug (rs=0.95, p<0.05). Moreover, the ciprofloxacin consumption was correlated with resistance to imipenem (rs=0.95, p<0.05) and ceftazidime (rs=0.95, p<0.05) in P. aeruginosa . A restriction use of ciprofloxacin has been taken during 2003, it is followed by a significant decrease of resistance to imipenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin in P. aeruginosa (p<0, 05). The use of fluoroquinolones was correlated significantly with MRSA (rs=0.96, P<0.05) . The restriction use of FQ was significantly associated with a decrease of MRSA. The consumption of ciprofloxacin was also correlated (P<0.05) with resistance of ceftazidime in K. pneumoniae. However, there is not a correlation (P> 0.05) between fluoroquinolones use and resistance in A. baumannii as well in ciprofloxacin, imipenem and ceftazidime. Our study illustrates the pressure of selection of fluoroquinolones use in the development of MDRB. The use and or the duration of treatment with theses antibiotics should be rationalised as part of efforts to control the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria.
TI  - Changes in the incidences of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant organisms isolated in a military medical center.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have emerged as the causes of nosocomial infections in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the incidence of these MDR bacteria over time in the military healthcare system, comparing isolates recovered from overseas combat casualties with isolates recovered from local military and civilian patients. METHODS: Retrospective electronic records review of culture and/or susceptibility testing results of patients admitted to a military level I trauma center in San Antonio, Texas, during the period from January 2001 through December 2008. Multidrug resistance was defined as the first isolated organism resistant to 3 or more classes of antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: Over time, the percentage of MDR A. baumannii isolates increased from 4% to 55%, whereas the percentage of MDR P. aeruginosa isolates increased from 2% to 8%. Respiratory tract specimens had a higher percentage of MDR A. baumannii isolates (49%), compared with specimens obtained from blood (30%), wound sites (24%), or urine (19%). No difference in the percentages of MDR P. aeruginosa isolates was observed with regard to source of specimen. The percentage of MDR A. baumannii isolates recovered was higher among patients who had been deployed overseas (52%) than among local patients (20%). When isolates recovered from patients in the burn intensive care unit (53% of MDR A. baumannii isolates) were removed from analysis, the percentage of MDR A. baumannii isolates decreased from 38% to 30% while the percentage of MDR P. aeruginosa isolates remained unaffected. CONCLUSION: The percentage of MDR A. baumannii isolates increased in this facility among combat casualties and among local patients, which indicates nosocomial transmission; however, there was no significant increase in the percentage of MDR P. aeruginosa isolates. Isolated changes in the MDR pathogens within a facility can occur. Possible interventions to limit the spread of these organisms could include implementing aggressive infection control practices, controlling antibiotic use, and using active culture surveillance.
TI  - Frequent multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii contamination of gloves, gowns, and hands of healthcare workers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacilli are important nosocomial pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of transmission of MDR Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients to healthcare workers (HCWs) during routine patient care. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Medical and surgical intensive care units. Methods. We observed HCWs who entered the rooms of patients colonized with MDR A. baumannii or colonized with both MDR A. baumannii and MDR P. aeruginosa. We examined their hands before room entry, their disposable gloves and/or gowns upon completion of patient care, and their hands after removal of gloves and/or gowns and before hand hygiene. RESULTS: Sixty-five interactions occurred with patients colonized with MDR A. baumannii and 134 with patients colonized with both MDR A. baumannii and MDR P. aeruginosa. Of 199 interactions between HCWs and patients colonized with MDR A. baumannii, 77 (38.7% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 31.9%-45.5%]) resulted in HCW contamination of gloves and/or gowns, and 9 (4.5% [95% CI, 1.6%-7.4%]) resulted in contamination of HCW hands after glove removal before hand hygiene. Of 134 interactions with patients colonized with MDR P. aeruginosa, 11 (8.2% [95% CI, 3.6%-12.9%]) resulted in HCW contamination of gloves and/or gowns, and 1 resulted in HCW contamination of hands. Independent risk factors for contamination with MDR A. baumannii were manipulation of wound dressing (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 25.9 [95% CI, 3.1-208.8]), manipulation of artificial airway (aOR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.1-4.0]), time in room longer than 5 minutes (aOR, 4.3 [95% CI, 2.0-9.1]), being a physician or nurse practitioner (aOR, 7.4 [95% CI, 1.6-35.2]), and being a nurse (aOR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.1-4.8]). CONCLUSIONS: Gowns, gloves, and unwashed hands of HCWs were frequently contaminated with MDR A. baumannii. MDR A. baumannii appears to be more easily transmitted than MDR P. aeruginosa and perhaps more easily transmitted than previously studied methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. This ease of transmission may help explain the emergence of MDR A. baumannii.

TI  - Identification of aryl 2-aminoimidazoles as biofilm inhibitors in Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The synthesis and biofilm inhibitory activity of a 30-member aryl amide 2-aminoimidazole library against the three biofilm forming Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii is presented. The most active compound identified inhibits the formation of E. coli biofilms with an IC(50) of 5.2 microM and was observed to be non-toxic to planktonic growth, demonstrating that analogues based on an aryl framework are viable options as biofilm inhibitors within the 2-aminoimidazole family.
TI  - Comparison of E-test and disc diffusion methods for the in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of colistin in multi-drug resistant Gram-negative Bacilli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study susceptibility of clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacilli to colistin by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination using Etest, and compare this with their susceptibility measured by the disc diffusion (DD) method. METHODS: A total of 224 of MDR organisms (147 Acinetobacter baumannii [A. baumannii], 49 Acinetobacter species, 24 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [S. maltophilia], and 43 Pseudomonas aeruginosa [P. aeruginosa]) were tested between January 2007 and August 2008 at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They were identified by standard microbiological methods. Susceptibility by DD and MIC by Etest were interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints. RESULTS: Using the MIC method, colistin was found to be active against 100% of Acinetobacter species, 98% of A. baumannii, 84% of P. aeruginosa, and 79% of S. maltophilia. An ascending order MIC90 of colistin was 1 microg/ml for A. baumannii, 1.5 microg/ml for Acinetobacter species, 3 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa, and 16 microg/ml for S. maltophilia. Comparing DD with the Etest method, very major errors of 1.4% were found for A. baumannii and 2.3% for P. aeruginosa, with minor errors of 0.7% for A. baumannii, 8.3% for S. maltophilia, and 11.6% for P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Colistin was active against most of the MDR isolates tested. The DD method showed significant errors when compared with the Etest method. We recommend using the MIC method to test the susceptibility of MDR Gram-negative bacilli organisms to colistin.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic modeling of intravenous antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria collected in the United States.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the era of escalating antimicrobial resistance, the choice of effective empiric antimicrobial therapy has become considerably more difficult. In an attempt to improve antimicrobial selection, pharmacodynamic modeling that considers the drug, dose, dosing interval, and duration of infusion is increasingly used as a tool to assist in the clinical decision-making process. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the PASSPORT (Probability of target attainment of Antibacterial agents Studied for Susceptibility and Pharmacodynamic Optimization in Regional Trials) study was to compare the probabilities of achieving requisite pharmacodynamic exposure (eg, T>MIC, AUC/MIC) of common intravenous antibiotics against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: Using a 5000-patient Monte Carlo simulation, pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted for standard and high-dose, prolonged (ie, 3-to 4-hour) infusions of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, doripenem, ertapenem, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam in adult patients with normal renal function (>or=50 mL/min). MIC data were incorporated from the 2008 TRUST (Tracking Resistance in the United States Today)-12 surveillance program, a long-running resistance study in 56 participating US hospitals. The cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was determined for each regimen against each population of E coli, K pneumoniae, A baumannii, and P aeruginosa. Optimal CFR was defined a priori as >or=90%. RESULTS: All of the beta-lactam regimens had optimal CFRs against E coli, and all but piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g q6h had optimal CFRs against K pneumoniae. The fluoroquinolones had the lowest CFRs against all of the pathogen populations tested (73.2%-88.9% against E coli and K pneumortfae; 44.5 %-61.9 % against A baumannii and P aeruginosa). Optimal CFR against A baumannii was not achieved with any of the regimens. Against P aeruginosa, high-dose, prolonged-infusion doripenem and meropenem had CFRs of 97.2% to 98.8%, followed by high-dose, prolonged-infusion ceftazidime (93.3%) and cefepime (93.2%). High-dose, prolonged-infusion regimens were associated with increased CFRs for all (beta-lactams by approximately 10% over that of standard 0.5-hour infusion regimens against the nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this model, standard doses of most intravenous (beta-lactam regimens had high probabilities of achieving optimal exposure against Enterobacteriaceae. For nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli such as A baumannii and P aeruginosa, high-dose, prolonged infusions of cefepime, ceftazidime, doripenem, and meropenem had the highest probabilities of achieving bactericidal exposure.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a virulent bacteriophage AB1 of Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging nosocomial pathogen worldwide  with increasing prevalence of multi-drug and pan-drug resistance. A. baumannii exists widely in natural environment, especially in health care settings, and has been shown difficult to be eradicated. Bacteriophages are often considered alternative agent for controlling bacterial infection and contamination. In this study, we described the isolation and characterization of one virulent bacteriophage AB1 capable of specifically infecting A. baumannii. RESULTS: A virulent bacteriophage AB1, specific for infecting a clinical strain A. baumannii KD311, was first isolated from marine sediment sample. Restriction analysis indicated that phage AB1 was a dsDNA virus with an approximate genome size of 45.2 kb to 46.9 kb. Transmission electron microscopy showed that phage AB1 had an icosahedral head with a non-contractile tail and collar or whisker structures, and might be tentatively classified as a member of the Siphoviridae family. Proteomic pattern of phage AB1, generated by SDS-PAGE using purified phage particles, revealed five major bands and six minor bands with molecular weight ranging from 14 to 80 kilo-dalton. Also determined was the adsorption rate of phage AB1 to the host bacterium, which was significantly enhanced by addition of 10 mM CaCl2. In a single step growth test, phage AB1 was shown having a latent period of 18 minutes and a burst size of 409. Moreover, pH and thermal stability of phage AB1 were also investigated. At the optimal pH 6.0, 73.2% of phages survived after 60 min incubation at 50 degrees C. When phage AB1 was used to infect four additional clinical isolates of A. baumannii, one clinical isolate of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa lab strains PAK and PAO1, none of the tested strains was found susceptible, indicating a relatively narrow host range for phage AB1. CONCLUSION: Phage AB1 was capable of eliciting efficient lysis of A. baumannii, revealing its potential as a non-toxic sanitizer for controlling A. baumannii infection and contamination in both hospital and other public environments.
TI  - Developing an anion host for lipid A binding and antibacterial activity.
AB  - New structural amphiphiles 2a and 2b bind the diphosphate lipid A anion and show  potential as lead compounds for the development of novel antibacterial agents.
TI  - [Prosthetic joint infections by multi-drug resistant bacteria].
AB  - Prosthetic joint infections by multi-drug resistant bacteria are today one of the most important and complex problems in orthopedics and traumatology. Most important and frequent resistant bacteria involved in infection of total joint replacements include: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. There are several laboratory tests available, but none has been shown to achieve 100% of sensitivity and specificity. Treatment of a patient with infection by a resistant organism, requires costly and prolonged hospital stay, weeks or months of antibiotic therapy, and often multiple surgical procedures. Only a strictly cooperation between orthopedic surgeon and infectious disease specialist, before, during and after prosthetic joint procedure, could improve patient management.
TI  - Epidemiology of bacterial colonization at intensive care unit admission with emphasis on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria--an Indian experience.
AB  - An important risk factor for nosocomial infection in an intensive care unit (ICU) is prior colonization. This study was undertaken to determine the spectrum of bacterial colonization and predisposing risk factors in patients being admitted to an ICU in India, with special emphasis on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria. Nasal, oral and rectal swab samples were collected and processed for isolation of ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria and MBL-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Bacterial colonization (of one or more sites) on admission was detected in 51 out of 96 patients included in the study. Non-fermenters, i.e. P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, were the most common colonizers, present in 37 patients, with simultaneous colonization in 12 patients. A total of 16 patients were colonized with MBL-producing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, out of which 11 isolates (from 5 patients) were also carrying ESBL-encoding genes. As for MBLs, most of our patients have shown colonization with ESBL-producing bacteria. On admission, 47 of 51 patients (92 %) have been colonized by ESBL-producing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, at one or more of the three anatomical sites. The most common MBL subtype was bla(IMP) (51.56 %), whereas bla(CTX) was the most common gene (84.9 %) identified among ESBL producers. Risk factors for colonization on admission to the ICU were hospitalization for more than 48 h, use of >or=3 groups of antibiotics, co-morbidities and mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h prior to ICU admission. There is an increasing incidence of MBLs and ESBLs in the Indian population. The identified risk factors can be used as a guide for empiric antibiotic therapy targeted to these resistant bacteria.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in long-term ventilator-assisted individuals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the characteristics of pneumonia in long-term ventilator-assisted individuals is scarce. We evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcome of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in a large series of chronically ventilated patients. METHODS: All patients assisted in a chronic ventilator-dependent unit were prospectively followed up for the development of VAP. Patients with a new and persistent lung infiltrate and a purulent tracheal aspirate were suspected to have VAP. Pneumonia was considered microbiologically confirmed in the presence of (1) a positive blood culture and/or (2) >/=10(5) CFU ml(-)(1) in quantitative bacterial culture of tracheal aspirates or >/=10(3) CFU ml(-)(1) in quantitative mini-bronchoalveolar lavage cultures. RESULTS: In total, 100 consecutive long-term ventilated individuals with spinal cord injury (mean age 49 years) were prospectively followed up. The length of mechanical ventilation before admission in the unit was 54+/-37 days, and the follow-up after admission was 119+/-127 days. There were 32 episodes of VAP in 27 patients (1.74 episodes per 1000 days of mechanical ventilation). By logistic regression analysis, hypoalbuminaemia (P=0.03), administration of antacids (P=0.002) and length of mechanical ventilation (P=0.05) were independent risk factors for VAP. The most frequently isolated organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (62%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (25%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (15%); 9 (28%) episodes were polymicrobial. Antimicrobial treatment, including monotherapy in 66%, was successful in most patients. Only three patients (11%) died in relation to VAP. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on long-term ventilation are at significant risk for the development of VAP, but the mortality is low.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of phi AB2: a novel bacteriophage of Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) are increasingly being reported worldwide. Bacteriophage therapy is a potential alternative treatment for MDR bacterial infections. Although A. baumannii infection has been experimentally treated with phages, no MDRAB-specific phage has been characterized. In this study, 10 phages with differing host ranges and lysis efficacy for MDRAB were isolated; one of these, phi AB2, was further studied. Electron microscopy revealed phi AB2 to have an isometric head (60 nm), a short tail (diameter, 9 nm; length, 11 nm) and a double-stranded DNA genome--which was resistant to digestion with several restriction endonucleases--estimated to be 40 kb by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Partial genome sequencing of a 2.1 kb region gave sequences resembling the tubular proteins A and B of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage LKA1. These data suggest that phi AB2 resembles phi KMV-like phages and is a new member of the Podoviridae family. It exhibited rapid adsorption (>99% adsorbed in 8 min), a short latent period (<10 min) and a large burst size (ca. 200); moreover, it was capable of infecting a wide spectrum of A. baumannii strains, causing virtually complete lysis, indicating that phi AB2 may be a good candidate as a therapeutic/disinfectant agent to control nosocomial infections caused by MDRAB.
TI  - The global problem of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Amid the recent attention justly focused on the potential problem of microbial sources for weapons of bioterrorism, it is also apparent that human pathogens frequently isolated from infections in patients from community and hospital sources have been growing more resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Much of the growth of multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens can be contributed to the overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobial products. However, an equally troubling and often overlooked component of the problem involves the elegant ways in which pathogenic bacteria continually evolve complex genetic systems for acquiring and regulating an endless array of antibiotic-resistance mechanisms. Efforts to develop new antimicrobials have over the past two decades been woefully behind the rapid evolution of resistance genes developing among both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. Several new agents that are best suited for use in the hospital environment have been developed to combat staphylococci resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobials following acquisition of the mecA gene. However, the dramatic spread in the US of the now common community strain of Staphylococcus aureus USA300 has shifted the therapeutic need for new antibiotics useful against MRSA to the community. As the pharmaceutical industry focused on discovering new agents for use against MRSA, hospitals in many parts of the world have seen the emergence of gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae that are clinically resistant to almost all available antimicrobials. Such MDR isolates usually contain multiple-resistance determinants, including loss of outer membrane porins via gene inactivation by chromosomally encoded insertion sequences, up-regulation of inate efflux pumps, as well as acquisition of drug-inactivating enzymes whose genes are encoded on self-transmissible plasmids, integrons, and complex transposable elements. These determinants confer a complex resistance phenotype that is often superimposed on mutations in the primary drug target in the cell. The continued evolution of such a complex array of antibiotic-resistance genes presents a formidable challenge at a time when large pharmaceutical companies have scaled down their presence in the anti-infectives arena.
TI  - In vitro double and triple bactericidal activities of doripenem, polymyxin B, and rifampin against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli.
AB  - In vitro double and triple bactericidal activities of doripenem, polymyxin B, and rifampin were assessed against 20 carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates with different mechanisms of carbapenem resistance. Bactericidal activity was achieved in 90% of all bacteria assayed using combinations of polymyxin B, doripenem, and rifampin against five each of the carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli isolates studied. Combinations with these antibacterials may provide a strategy for treatment of patients infected with such organisms.
TI  - Activity of doripenem with and without levofloxacin, amikacin, and colistin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - At 24 h, sub-MIC doripenem and levofloxacin showed synergy against 21 of 25 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, sub-MIC doripenem and amikacin against 22 isolates, and sub-MIC doripenem and colistin against 19 isolates. Of 25 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, sub-MIC doripenem and levofloxacin showed synergy against 11 strains at 24 h, sub-MIC doripenem and amikacin against 24 strains, and sub-MIC doripenem and colistin against all isolates.
TI  - The microbiological characteristics of patients with crush syndrome after the Wenchuan earthquake.
AB  - To improve the treatment of infectious diseases in patients with crush syndrome,  we analyzed the results of bacteriological examinations, including antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, of samples taken from patients with crush syndrome admitted to West China Hospital, Sichuan University, after the Wenchuan earthquake. A total of 210 non-replicate clinical isolates were recovered from 42 of the 66 earthquake victims with crush syndrome. Their mean age was 26.9 +/- 15.7 y and 40 of them were male. The length of hospital stay was 14.0 days. Wound, blood, sputa, urine and catheter sample specimens were examined. Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 72.4%, 20.0% and 7.6% of the isolates, respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the major isolates from wounds. Of the isolated strains, 92.8% occurred at >48 h following admission to the hospital, and most of these agents were common isolates in our hospital. Furthermore, 40.9% of these patients were carriers of multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms. Therefore, we can conclude that patients with crush syndrome may have an increased risk of hospital-acquired infection (HAI), suggesting that it is important to select effective antibiotics to control HAI in a timely manner according to the microbiological data.
TI  - Multidrug resistance among gram-negative pathogens that caused healthcare-associated infections reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network, 2006-2008.
AB  - We evaluated isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii that were reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network from January 2006 through December 2008 to determine the proportion that represented multidrug-resistant phenotypes. The pooled mean percentage of resistance varied by the definition used; however, multidrug resistance was relatively common and widespread.
TI  - Microbial contamination of suction tubes attached to suction instruments and preventive methods.
AB  - We investigated the microbial contamination of suction tubes attached to wall-type suction instruments. Microbial contamination of suction tubes used for endoscopy or sputum suction in hospital wards was examined before and after their disinfection. In addition, disinfection and washing methods for suction tubes were evaluated. Suction tubes (n=33) before disinfection were contaminated with 10(2)-10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/tube. The main contaminants were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The suction tubes were disinfected with sodium hypochlorite (n=11) or hot water (n=11), or by an automatic tube cleaner (n=11). After 2-h immersion in 0.1% (1,000 ppm) sodium hypochlorite, 10(3)-10(7) cfu/tube of bacteria were detected in all 11 tubes examined. After washing in hot running water (65 degrees C), 10(3)-10(7) cfu/tube were detected in 3 of the 11 examined tubes. The bacteria detected in the suction tubes after disinfection with sodium hypochlorite or hot water were P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and S. maltophilia. On the other hand, after washing with warm water (40 degrees C) using the automatic tube cleaner, contamination was found to be <20 cfu/tube (lower detection limit, 20 cfu/tube) in all 11 tubes examined. These results suggest the usefulness of washing with automatic tube cleaners.
TI  - Mutant prevention concentrations of four carbapenems against gram-negative rods.
AB  - We tested the propensities of four carbapenems to select for resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii mutants by determining the mutant prevention concentrations (MPCs) for 100 clinical strains with various ss-lactam phenotypes. Among the members of the Enterobacteriaceae family and A. baumannii strains, the MPC/MIC ratios were mostly 2 to 4. In contrast, for P. aeruginosa the MPC/MIC ratios were 4 to > or =16. The MPC/MIC ratios for beta-lactamase-positive K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates were much higher (range, 4 to >16 microg/ml) than those for ss-lactamase-negative strains.
TI  - Clinical characteristics of nosocomial infections in neonatal intensive care unit in eastern China.
AB  - A retrospective cohort study on nosocomial infections (NI) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was performed in the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou district, China. The most common infection site was pneumonia and bloodstream infection. Low admission age, long NICU stay, and mechanical ventilation were significant risk factors for NI. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common pathogen, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus epidermidi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Antibiotic resistance of the isolated bacterium was high. In conclusion, this study described the clinical characteristics of NI in a Chinese NICU, which might contribute to implementation of more effective therapeutic and preventive strategies.
TI  - Multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii infections among hospitalized patients: risk factors and outcomes.
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Pseudomonas aeruginosa [PA] and Acinetobacter baumannii [AB] are important nosocomial pathogens in health care settings. Treatment is complicated by multi-drug resistance [MDR]. Increasing resistance to carbapenems mediated by metallobetalactamase [MBL] and other mechanisms is a cause for concern because they adversely affect clinical outcomes and add to treatment costs. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of MBL production in carbapenem-resistant isolates and to study the factors influencing the clinical outcomes of infections. METHODS: Fifty-five carbapenem-resistant nosocomial isolates of PA (30) and AB (25) were included for the study. Multidrug resistance was defined as being resistant to all classes of antibiotics including carbapenems. This was determined by disc diffusion method in accordance with CLSI. Minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] to imipenem and meropenem was done by agar dilution method. MBL production was detected using ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA] as inhibitor both by disc diffusion and MIC testing. Risk factors related to hospital and ICU stay were analysed. Outcomes were followed up. Proportions were compared using Chi square test to determine the factors influencing the outcome. Differences were considered significant if P was < 0.05. RESULTS: All isolates exhibited moderate to high degree of resistance to carbapenems. Their MIC ranged from 8-2048 mcg/ml. Crossresistance to cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and beta lactam-betalactamase combination was seen in all isolates. Ninety two percent were susceptible to polymyxins. MBL was detected in 44 isolates [PA-29, AB-15], while 11 isolates were negative. The common site of isolation was the respiratory tract (41.8%) followed by urinary tract (25.5%), wound (20%) and blood (12.7%). Colonisation from infection was deliniated based on clinical and laboratory criteria. Death occured in 57% of patients. Factors contributing to mortality were length of hospital and ICU stay (P = 0.001), intubation (P = 0.0005), usage of multiple invasive devices and presence of a focal or a generalized infection (P = 0.001). Administration of multiple antibiotics did not affect the mortality CONCLUSIONS: MBL-mediated carbapenem resistance in PA and AB is a significant threat in hospitalised patients. It should be addressed with infection control measures, surveillance and alternative new therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in pathogens causing nosocomial infections in surgery and intensive care units of two hospitals in Antananarivo, Madagascar.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In developing countries, knowledge of antimicrobial resistance patterns is essential to define empirical therapy. METHODOLOGY: All the surgery and intensive care wards of two hospitals in Antananarivo were included to study the antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogenic bacteria causing nosocomial infections. A repeated cross-sectional survey was conducted between September 2006 and March 2008, one day per week. Isolates were identified using classical methods, and resistance to antibiotics was assessed according to the recommendations of the Antibiogram Committee of the French Microbiology Society. RESULTS: Clinical specimens from 706 from 651 patients were collected. Of the 533 bacterial pathogens, 46.7% were Enterobacteriaceae, 19.3% were Staphylococcus aureus, and 19.1% were pathogens from the hospital environment (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii).Frequencies of resistance were high, particularly in Enterobacteriaceae; however, the rate of Staphylococcus aureus isolates resistant to oxacillin (13.6 %) was moderate and all these isolates were susceptible to glycopeptids. The percentages of isolates susceptible to ceftazidim were 81.8% for E. coli, 60.9% for Klebsiella, and 52.5% for Enterobacter spp. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was due to extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBL). Multivariate analysis showed that diabetes (adjusted OR: 3.9) and use of an invasive procedures (adjusted OR: 3.5) were independent risk factors for resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. CONCLUSION: A nationwide surveillance programme is needed to monitor the microbial trends and antimicrobial resistance in Madagascar.
TI  - Treatment options for multidrug-resistant nonfermenters.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant nonfermenters are a worldwide threat. Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and Acinetobacter baumannii have been associated with high mortality and treatment failures. In addition, therapeutic options are increasingly narrowed, mainly due to widespread resistance in these pathogens and a shortage of new antimicrobial compounds. Hence, old, potent but toxic antibiotics such as the polymyxins are re-emerging as therapeutic options. Maximizing pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics with existing agents is also a worthwhile approach to explore. This problem exemplifies the critical need for new drug development for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) report, data summary for 2003-2008, issued June 2009.
AB  - We report the results of the International Infection Control Consortium (INICC) surveillance study from January 2003 through December 2008 in 173 intensive care units (ICUs) in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. During the 6-year study, using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) US National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN; formerly the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system [NNIS]) definitions for device-associated health care-associated infection, we collected prospective data from 155,358 patients hospitalized in the consortium's hospital ICUs for an aggregate of 923,624 days. Although device utilization in the developing countries' ICUs was remarkably similar to that reported from US ICUs in the CDC's NHSN, rates of device-associated nosocomial infection were markedly higher in the ICUs of the INICC hospitals: the pooled rate of central venous catheter (CVC)-associated bloodstream infections (BSI) in the INICC ICUs, 7.6 per 1000 CVC-days, is nearly 3-fold higher than the 2.0 per 1000 CVC-days reported from comparable US ICUs, and the overall rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was also far higher, 13.6 versus 3.3 per 1000 ventilator-days, respectively, as was the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), 6.3 versus 3.3 per 1000 catheter-days, respectively. Most strikingly, the frequencies of resistance of Staphylococcus aureus isolates to methicillin (MRSA) (84.1% vs 56.8%, respectively), Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime or ceftriaxone (76.1% vs 27.1%, respectively), Acinetobacter baumannii to imipenem (46.3% vs 29.2%, respectively), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin (78.0% vs 20.2%, respectively) were also far higher in the consortium's ICUs, and the crude unadjusted excess mortalities of device-related infections ranged from 23.6% (CVC-associated bloodstream infections) to 29.3% (VAP).
TI  - Quantitative assessment of combination antimicrobial therapy against multidrug-resistant bacteria in a murine pneumonia model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combination antimicrobial therapy is clinically used as a last-resort strategy to control multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. However, selection of antibiotics is often empirical, and conventional assessment of combined drug effect has not been correlated to clinical outcomes. Here, we report a quantitative method to assess combined killing of antimicrobial agents against 2 multidrug-resistant bacteria. METHODS: Combined time-kill studies were performed using clinically achievable concentrations for each 2-agent combination against clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacterial burden observed at 24 h was mathematically modeled using a 3-dimensional response surface. Subsequently, a neutropenic murine pneumonia model with simulated clinical dosing exposures was used to validate our quantitative assessment of combined killing. RESULTS: Different antimicrobial combinations were found to have varying efficacy against the multidrug-resistant bacteria. As predicted by our quantitative method, cefepime plus amikacin was found to be the most superior combination, which was evidenced by a reduction in tissue bacterial burden and prolonged survival of infected animals. CONCLUSIONS: The consistency between the predictions of the mathematical model and in vivo observations substantiated the robustness of our quantitative method. These data highlighted a novel and promising method to guide rational selection of antimicrobial combination in the clinical setting.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in HAP, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of MICs </=2 microg/mL for the entire collection). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Enterobacter cloacae. As reported previously, a few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.
TI  - Colistin administration to pediatric and neonatal patients.
AB  - Emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens has led to resurgence of colistin use. Safety and efficacy data regarding colistin use in pediatric patients are sparse, while optimal dosage has not been defined. We present a case series of neonates and children without cystic fibrosis treated with various doses of colistin intravenously. The records of patients who received colistin in a tertiary-care hospital from January 2007 to March 2009 were reviewed. Thirteen patients (median age 5 years, range 22 days to 14 years) received 19 courses of colistin as treatment of pneumonia, central nervous system infection, bacteremia, or complicated soft tissue infection. The isolated pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Daily dose of colistin (colistimethate) ranged between 40,000 and 225,000 IU/kg. Duration of administration ranged from 1 to 133 days. Other antimicrobials were co-administered in 18/19 courses. Increase of serum creatinine in one patient was associated with co-administration of colistin and gentamicin. Sixteen of 19 courses had a favorable outcome, and only two of the three deaths were infection-related. Colistin intravenous administration appears well tolerated even at higher than previously recommended doses and of prolonged duration.
TI  - [Microbiologic study on the pathogens isolated from wound culture among orthopaedic patients after Wenchuan earthquake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the bacterial characteristic of orthopedic open wounds injured in Wenchuan earthquake and their drug-resistant pattern for reasonable application of antibiotics. METHODS: A total of 340 secretion specimens isolated from 148 cases of orthopedic open wounds of earthquake victims were analyzed. Among the patients, 71 patients were male and 77 patients were female, ranging in age from 2 to 82 years, with an average of 40.4 years. Thirty-seven patients were detained under the ground ranged from 5 min to 102 h. The 340 specimens of exudation in the wound were collected for bacterial culture and drug sensitivity tests. RESULTS: The infection rate of 148 cases was 66.2 percent. Two hundred and fifty-seven pathogens were isolated from 340 secretion specimen, including gram-negative bacteria accounted for 77.8%, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 20.6%. The most frequent pathogens isolated from secretion culture in Wenchuan earthquake survivors were Escherichia coli (16.3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (16.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5%) and Enterobacter cloacae (8.6%). CONCLUSION: The drug sensitivity test of exudation as well as exact application of antibiotics should be highly payed attention to by doctors in order to reduce the occurrence of bacterial resistance.
TI  - In vitro activities of doripenem and other carbapenems against clinically important bacteria isolated in intensive care units: nationwide data from the SMART Programme.
AB  - This nationwide surveillance of clinically important bacteria from the intensive  care units (ICUs) of major teaching hospitals throughout Taiwan investigated the susceptibilities to doripenem and other comparator carbapenems from September through November 2005. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for 1,311 clinical isolates using the broth microdilution method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2005 guidelines. Doripenem showed similar (within four-fold difference of MICs) in vitro activity to meropenem for Enterobacteriaceae and probably comparable activity to meropenem against important nosocomial non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNBs), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Burkholderia cepacia. Among the four carbapenems analysed, doripenem and meropenem exhibited better in vitro activity than imipenem or ertapenem against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates. However, the meropenem MIC(90) against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates was 2 microg/ml. Besides, doripenem with the MIC(90) of 0.5 microg/ml to Streptococcus pneumoniae possibly suggested its potential therapeutic effect regarding community-acquired pneumonia. Because of the heavy resistance burden in Taiwan, closely monitoring the evolutionary trend of carbapenem susceptibilities against clinically important pathogens is crucial in the future.
TI  - Microbiological study of pathogenic bacteria isolated from paediatric wound infections following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.
AB  - On 12 May 2008, the Wenchuan earthquake struck in Sichuan, China. Within 1 month  after the earthquake, 98 injured children were admitted to the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. According to clinical manifestations, 50 children were diagnosed with wound infections. Wound secretions were cultured for bacteria. Pathogen distribution and drug resistance were analyzed. A total of 99 pathogens were isolated; 16 (16%) were Gram-positive bacteria and 81 (82%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The distribution of pathogens isolated within 1 month after the earthquake was different to the distribution of pathogens in 546 general hospitalized cases in the y before the earthquake. The pathogens most frequently isolated 1 month after the earthquake were Acinetobacter baumannii (27%), Enterobacter cloacae (18%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%). The pathogens most frequently isolated in the y prior to the earthquake were Escherichia coli (27%), Staphylococcus aureus (23%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (9%). The rate of isolated drug-resistant bacteria was higher in the earthquake cases than in the general hospitalized cases. In the cases injured in the earthquake, the rates of isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were higher than in the cases from before the earthquake. Multidrug-resistant and pandrug-resistant A. baumannii were isolated at a higher rate in cases after the earthquake than in those before the earthquake. These changes in the spectrum of pathogens and in the drug resistance of the pathogens isolated following an earthquake will provide the basis for emergency treatment after earthquakes.
TI  - Prospective analysis of nosocomial infections in a burn care unit, Turkey.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Prevention of infection in burned patients poses a great  challenge as infection is the most common cause of mortality after burn injury. An analysis of burned patients, admitted and treated between January 2004 and December 2005 in a nine-bed burn unit in Turkey, was performed prospectively to identify the common pathogens and incidence of nosocomial infection in these patients. METHODS: Of the 182 burn cases admitted to Burn Care Unit during the study period, 169 met the inclusion criteria. Information related to nosocomial infection (NI) was collected. Samples were collected for culture and microorganisms isolated were tested for antimicrobial sensitivity. RESULTS: Of the 169 burn patients, 127 acquired 166 nosocomial infection (NI) (15.7% pneumonia, 56.0% burn wound infection, 8.4% urinary tract infection and 19.9% blood stream infection) with an overall NI rate of 18.2 per 1000 patient-days. The mean age (38 +/- 21 yr), the mean length of hospitalization (45.06 +/- 11.67 days) and the total burned surface area (TBSA) (34.58 +/- 18.46%) of the patients with NI were higher than those of the patients with non NI (23 +/- 17 yr), (16.38 +/- 11.14 days) and (12.44 +/- 8.69%) (P=0.03, P=0.001, P=0.01) respectively. By multiple logistic regression analysis, TBSA co-morbidities, broad spectrum antibiotic usage and invasive devices usage were significantly related to acquisition of NI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57%), Acinetobacter baumannii (21%) and Staphylococcus aureus (14%) were the most common resistant organisms isolated. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize the need for careful disinfection and more strict infection control procedures in areas that serve immunosupressed individuals, such as burn patients.
TI  - Intravenous colistin sulfate: a rarely used form of polymyxin E for the treatment of severe multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  - In recent reports polymyxins have been considered an effective and safe treatment option for the management of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial infections. Here we report our clinical experience with the use of intravenous colistin sulfate in critically ill patients hospitalized from January 2006 to October 2008, as a last treatment resort in China, and assess its effectiveness and adverse effects. Fifteen patients who suffered from severe infections caused by MDR or pandrug-resistant (PDR) Gram-negative bacteria (13 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, 4 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 2 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae), unresponsive to the initial empirical regimens, were treated with colistin sulfate (daily dose of 1.28 +/- 0.25 million IU and duration of 22.3 +/- 6.2 days), based on sensitivity results. The treatment resulted in a good clinical response in 73.3%, microbiological clearance in 60% and mortality in 20%. Possible nephrotoxicity occurred in 1 patient and no patients developed neurotoxicity. In conclusion, intravenous colistin sulfate is a safe and viable alternative for the treatment of severe infections due to sensitive MDR Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Efficacy of copper-silver ionization in controlling biofilm- and plankton-associated waterborne pathogens.
AB  - The study was to determine the efficacy of copper-silver ionization against the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii in biofilms and planktonic phases. At concentrations below the EPA limits, ionization has potential to control the three waterborne pathogens, in addition to Legionella, in hospital water systems for nosocomial infection control.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms recovered at a military burn center.
AB  - Infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with burn injuries. We performed a 6-year antibiotic susceptibility records review from January 2003 to December 2008 to assess the prevalence of MDR isolates by pathogen at the US Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center. During the study period Acinetobacter baumannii (780 isolates [22%]) was the most prevalent organism recovered, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (703 isolates [20%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (695 isolates [20%]), and Staphylococcus aureus (469 isolates [13%]). MDR prevalence rates among these isolates were A. baumannii 53%, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) 34%, K. pneumoniae 17% and P. aeruginosa 15%. Two isolates, 1 A. baumannii and 1 P. aeruginosa, were identified as resistant to all 4 classes of antibiotics tested plus colistin. A. baumannii isolates recovered from patients with burns greater than 30% of total body surface area (TBSA) were more likely to be MDR (61%) with no significant difference for P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. A higher proportion of MDR P. aeruginosa isolates were recovered from respiratory specimens compared to blood specimens (24% vs. 9%) while the opposite was true for MRSA (35% vs. 54%). A comparison of A. baumannii recovered during hospitalization days 1-5 and 15-30 revealed higher MDR levels as length of stay increased (48% vs. 75%) while no significant trends were observed for P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. A similar pattern was observed for MDR A. baumannii levels for the facility between 2003 and 2005 and 2006-2008 (39% vs. 70%), with no significant increase in MDR P. aeruginosa and MDR K. pneumoniae. Increasing antibiotic resistance patterns of the most prevalent isolates recovered during extended hospitalization, impact of % TBSA and other clinical parameters may affect empirical antimicrobial therapy and patient management decisions during treatment.
TI  - [Recent trend and research issues related to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria].
AB  - The discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. These discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. However, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. Today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. Infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. In this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.
TI  - Chemical synthesis and biological screening of 2-aminoimidazole-based bacterial and fungal antibiofilm agents.
AB  - A collection of 2-aminoimidazole/triazole amides has been synthesized and screened for antibiofilm activity. This class of small molecules was found to modulate the biofilm activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Rhodospirillum salexigens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Vibrio vulnificus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium as well as the yeast Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Furthermore, lead compounds were found to not lyse red blood cells at active concentrations.
TI  - Risk factors for pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli among liver recipients.
AB  - Pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacilli is associated with a higher mortality rate. The appropriate empiric therapy is based on the understanding of local etiology and MDR pattern. This study was to evaluate the spectrum of Gram-negative bacilli, MDR rate, risk factors and mortality in 475 liver transplantation (LT) recipients. In the first six months after LT, the incidence of bacterial pneumonia was 21.3% (101/475). The overall infectious incidence during the first post-transplant month was 80.2%. The most frequent pneumonia isolates were Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Gram-negative bacilli accounted for 69.6% of all pneumonia pathogens. Of the main 124 Gram-negative bacilli isolates, MDR rate was 58.9%. Four risk factors for post-LT pneumonia caused by MDR Gram-negative bacilli were LT candidates with grade II-IV encephalopathy (OR 2.275, 95%CI 1.249-4.124, p = 0.006), prolonged duration of endotracheal intubation (OR 8.224, 95%CI 4.276-15.815, p = 0.013), tracheostomy (OR 4.929, 95%CI 1.099-18.308, p = 0.027) and post-LT episode(s) of reoperations (OR 10.597, 95%CI 3.726-30.134, p < 0.001). MDR Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia-related mortality was significantly higher than that because of antibiotic-susceptible bacilli (45.6% vs. 11.4%, p = 0.010). Our data suggest that pneumonia caused by MDR Gram-negative bacilli after LT is common, and associated with the severity of underlying disease, prolonged mechanical ventilation and upper abdominal surgery.
TI  - Incidence and bacteriology of burn infections at a military burn center.
AB  - Considerable advancements in shock resuscitation and wound management have extended the survival of burned patients, increasing the risk of serious infection. We performed a 6-year review of bacteria identification and antibiotic susceptibility records at the US Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center between January 2003 and December 2008. The primary goal was to identify the bacteria recovered from patients with severe burns and determine how the bacteriology changes during extended hospitalization as influenced by population and burn severity. A total of 460 patients were admitted to the burn ICU with 3507 bacteria recovered from 13,727 bacteriology cultures performed. The most prevalent organisms recovered were Acinetobacter baumannii (780), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (703), Klebsiella pneumoniae (695) and Staphylococcus aureus (469). A. baumannii was most often recovered from combat-injured (58%) and S. aureus the most frequent isolate from local (46%) burn patients. Culture recovery rate of A. baumannii and S. aureus was highest during the first 15 hospital days (73% and 71%); while a majority of P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae were recovered after day 15 (63% and 53%). All 4 pathogens were recovered throughout the course of hospitalization. A. baumannii was the most prevalent pathogen recovered from patients with total body surface area (TBSA) burns less than 30% (203) and 30-60% (338) while P. aeruginosa was most prevalent in patients with burns greater than 60% TBSA (292). Shifting epidemiology of bacteria recovered during extended hospitalization, bacteriology differences between combat-injured and local burn patients, and impact of % TBSA may affect patient management decisions during the course of therapy.
TI  - [Monitoring of nosocomial infections in intensive care units].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intensive care units (ICUs) are distinguished by the use of specialist medical procedures based on invasive monitoring and mechanical support of dysfunctional organs or systems of the body. Patients at ICUs represent a specific group due to the fact that many of them will suffer infections in the course of hospitalization which pose a threat to their health or life and exert an impact on the therapeutic success. The aim of this study was to perform a prospective analysis of hospital infections at the intensive care unit, to determine etiologic factors and clinical forms of infection, as well as to define infection risk factors specific for the patient or related to the diagnosis, treatment, and specific procedures at the unit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was done in 234 patients hospitalized at the Department of Intensive Medical Care, Pomeranian Medical University, Independent Public Clinical Hospital No. 1 in Szczecin during one year. An infection registration card was created for each patient. Samples for microbiological tests were routinely collected once a week or in the event of suspected infection. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The prospective clinical, microbiological, and epidemiologic analysis performed at the ICU demonstrated that: a) infections were diagnosed in approx. 45% of the patients, b) the most common clinical forms of infection were: pneumonia (87.5%), sepsis (44.2%), and urinary tract infection (36.5%). Two to four clinical forms of infection were seen in approx. 64% of the patients, c) the most common etiologic factor of infection, irrespectively of the clinical form, were Gram-negative bacteria, predominantly Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, d) patient-related infection risk factors of importance included male gender and overweight/obesity, e) procedure--related infection risk factors considerably contributing to infection included: bronchial toilet, tracheostomy, drainage of body cavities, feeding through a gastric tube, gastrostomy, central vessel cannulation, parenteral feeding, and chemotherapy. 2. The understanding of the prevalence and circumstances of infections at ICUs will help verify standards of preventive and therapeutic management at the ICU and may contribute to adequate control and efficient treatment of infections.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of gram negative bacilli isolated from the lower respiratory tract of ventilated patients in the Intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are the most frequent infections among patients in Intensive care units (ICUs). AIMS: To know the bacterial profile and determine the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the lower respiratory tract isolates from patients admitted to the ICU. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Tertiary care hospital, retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transtracheal or bronchial aspirates from 207 patients admitted to the ICU were cultured, identified, and antibiotic sensitivity was performed by standard methods. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: SPSS software was used for calculation of % R of 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Of 207 specimens, 144 (69.5%) were culture positive and 63 (30.4%) showed no growth. From 144 culture positives, 161 isolates were recovered, of which 154 (95.6%) were Gram negative bacilli (GNB). In 17 (11.0%) patients, two isolates per specimen were recovered. The most common GNB in order of frequency were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35%), Acinetobacter baumannii (23.6%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.6%). A very high rate of resistance (80-100%) was observed among predominant GNB to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, co-trimoxazole, and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid combination. Least resistance was noted to meropenem and doxycycline. CONCLUSION: Nonfermenters are the most common etiological agents of LRTIs in ICU. There is an alarmingly high rate of resistance to cephalosporin and beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor group of drugs. Meropenem was found to be the most sensitive drug against all GNB. Acinetobacter and Klebsiella spp. showed good sensitivity to doxycycline.
TI  - Detection of KPC in Acinetobacter spp. in Puerto Rico.
AB  - During an island-wide PCR-based surveillance study of beta-lactam resistance in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex isolates obtained from 17 different hospitals, 10 KPC-positive Acinetobacter isolates were identified. DNA sequencing of the bla(KPC) gene identified KPC-2, -3, and -4 and a novel variant, KPC-10. This is the first report of a KPC-type beta-lactamase identified in Acinetobacter species.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii: resistance mechanisms and implications for therapy.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are major nosocomial pathogens worldwide. Both are intrinsically resistant to many drugs and are able to become resistant to virtually any antimicrobial agent. An increasing prevalence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates has been reported in many countries. The resistance mechanisms of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii include the production of beta-lactamases, efflux pumps, and target-site or outer membrane modifications. Resistance to multiple drugs is usually the result of the combination of different mechanisms in a single isolate or the action of a single potent resistance mechanism. There are many challenges in the treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, especially considering the absence of new antimicrobials in the drug-development pipeline. In this review, we present the major resistance mechanisms of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, and discuss how they can affect antimicrobial therapy, considering recent clinical, microbiological, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic findings of the main drugs used to treat MDR isolates.
TI  - Colistin therapy for microbiologically documented multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections: a retrospective cohort study of 258 patients.
AB  - It is unclear whether the effectiveness of polymyxins depends on the site of infection, the responsible pathogen, dosage, and monotherapy vs. combination therapy. We investigated colistin therapy in a large, retrospective, single-centre, cohort study. Primary analysis outcomes were infection outcome, survival and nephrotoxicity. Over a 7-year period (October 2000 to October 2007), 258 patients received intravenous (i.v.) colistin for at least 72h for microbiologically documented multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections, comprising 170 (65.9%) Acinetobacter baumannii, 68 (26.4%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 (7.0%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 (0.4%) Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 1 (0.4%) Enterobacter cloacae. Cure of infection occurred in 79.1% of patients, nephrotoxicity in 10% and hospital survival in 65.1%. In the multivariate analysis, independent predictors of survival were colistin average daily dose [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.42] and cure of infection (aOR=9, 95% CI 3.6-23.1), whilst the proportion of creatinine change (aOR=0.21, 95% CI 0.1-0.45), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (aOR=0.89, 95% CI 0.84-0.95) and haematological disease (aOR=0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.66) were associated with mortality. Effectiveness of colistin was not dependent on the type of pathogen. No independent predictors for nephrotoxicity were observed. The findings of the largest cohort study to date on i.v. colistin show that colistin is a valuable antibiotic with acceptable nephrotoxicity and considerable effectiveness that depends on the daily dosage and infection site.
TI  - Colistimethate sodium therapy for multidrug-resistant isolates in pediatric patients.
AB  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of colistimethate sodium therapy in multidrug-resistant nosocomial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii in neonates and children. METHODS: Pediatric patients hospitalized at the Uludag University Hospital who had nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii, were enrolled in the study. Colistimethate sodium at a dosage of 50-75 x 10(3) U/kg per day was given i.v. divided into three doses. RESULTS: Fifteen patients received 17 courses of colistimethate sodium for the following infections: ventilator-associated pneumonia (n= 14), catheter-related sepsis (n= 1) and skin and soft-tissue infection (n= 2). The mean age of patients was 53.2 + 74.7 months (range, 8 days-15 years) and 60% were male. Mortality was 26.6%. CONCLUSION: Colistimethate sodium appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii in pediatric patients.
TI  - Studies on the mechanism of p-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a system composed of a small flavin reductase and a large flavin-dependent oxygenase.
AB  - There are two known types of microbial two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases that catalyze oxygenation of p-hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA), and they are distinguished by having structurally distinct reductases and oxygenases. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the properties of the enzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an example of one group, and compares its properties to those published for the Acinetobacter baumannii enzyme, an example of the alternative group. The reductase and oxygenase from P. aeruginosa were expressed in Escherichia coli. The reductase was purified as a stable C-terminally His-tagged yellow protein containing weakly bound FAD, and the oxygenase was purified as a stable colorless N-terminally His-tagged protein. The reductase catalyzes the reduction of FAD by NADH and releases the FADH(-) product into solution, but unlike the reductase from A. baumannii, this catalysis is not influenced by HPA. The oxygenase binds the released FADH(-) and catalyzes the oxygenation of HPA to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate, after which the FAD dissociates to be re-reduced by the reductase, a common overall pattern for two-component flavin-dependent oxygenases. With this system, it appears that interactions between the reductase and the oxygenase can facillitate the transfer of FADH(-) to the oxygenase, although they are not required. We show that the P. aeruginosa oxygenase system in complex with FADH(-) reacts with O(2) to form a quasi-stable, unusually high-extinction flavin hydroperoxide species that binds HPA and reacts to form the product. The resultant flavin hydroxide decomposes to FAD and water while still bound to the oxygenase and then releases product and FAD from the protein. Unlike the enzyme from A. baumannii, during normal catalysis involving both the reductase and oxygenase, the rate-determining step in catalysis is the dissociation of FAD from the oxygenase in a process that is independent of the concentration of HPA. Structures for the reductases and oxygenases from A. baumannii and from Thermus thermophilus (similar to the P. aeruginosa system) form a basis for interpreting the molecular origins of the differences between the two groups of flavin-dependent two-component oxygenases.
TI  - New antibiotics: optimal use in current clinical practice.
AB  - The optimal choice of antibacterial therapy among the few available options for infections caused by pathogens with advanced antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to maximize clinical effectiveness and minimize the likelihood for further resistance development. We herein review the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotics introduced in clinical practice during the past 10 years for specific clinical indications. Quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have increased the available therapeutic options against specific types of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections. The newer fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, along with the ketolide telithromycin and the oral third-generation cephalosporin cefditoren are particularly valuable for the treatment of specific types of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Ertapenem and doripenem may be particularly useful against infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.
TI  - Activity of the siderophore monobactam BAL30072 against multiresistant non-fermenters.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We tested the activity of BAL30072, a novel siderophore monobactam, against multiresistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia group and Acinetobacter spp. and against laboratory P. aeruginosa strains with defined resistance mechanisms. METHODS: MICs were determined on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 2,2' bipyridyl to induce iron transport; comparators were aztreonam, imipenem, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. RESULTS: BAL30072 was strikingly active against Acinetobacter baumannii, with 73% of 200 carbapenemase-producing isolates, most of them belonging to the UK-dominant OXA-23 clone 1 and SE clone lineages, susceptible at 1 mg/L and 89% at 8 mg/L. Resistance nevertheless was seen in a few representatives of these clones and appeared commoner among isolates representing other A. baumannii clones. Sixty-eight per cent of 50 B. cepacia complex isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) were susceptible to BAL30072 at 1 mg/L and 78% at 8 mg/L, compared with only 22% susceptible to aztreonam at 8 mg/L. Activity against P. aeruginosa was good, though less dramatic, with 36% of 50 (mostly multiresistant) CF isolates susceptible at 8 mg/L, compared with 12% susceptible to aztreonam at 8 mg/L. BAL30072 was active against 11/19 metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa at 8 mg/L compared with 3/19 for aztreonam (12/19 versus 8/19 at 16 mg/L). Studies on P. aeruginosa mutants, isolates and transconjugants showed that BAL30072 was affected by efflux, AmpC and by a few uncommon acquired beta-lactamases, including some extended-spectrum OXA types and PER-1. CONCLUSIONS: BAL30072 displayed impressive activity against many carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii, particularly against the two clones most prevalent in the UK, and also against B. cepacia complex isolates from CF; it was more active than aztreonam against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Update on antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  - There is a constant need for new antibacterial agents because of the unavoidable  development of bacterial resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics in clinical practice. As observed in many fields, innovation generally comes by series. For instance, a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents became available between the 1970s and the 1990s, such as cephalosporins, penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. Over the last 2 decades, the arrival of new antibacterial drugs on the market has dramatically slowed, leaving a frequent gap between isolation of resistant pathogens and effective treatment options. In fact, many pharmaceutical companies focused on the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeted at multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium). Therefore, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii) recently emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. Even if some molecules were developed, new molecules for infections caused by these multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria remain remarkably scarce compared to those for Gram-positive infections. This review summarises the major microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties of systemic antibiotics recently marketed in France (i.e. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, ertapenem, and doripenem) as well as those of antibacterial drugs currently in development (i.e. ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin, iclaprim, and ramoplanin) or available in other countries (i.e. garenoxacin, sitafloxacin, and temocillin).
TI  - [Clinical assessment of colistin in treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacillus in patients with severe burn].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect and side effects of colistin in  treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacillus in patients with severe burn in order to provide the basis for reasonable application of this antibiotic in clinic. METHODS: Nine burn patients suffered from infections caused by MDR gram-negative bacillus admitted to our institute from August 2005 to January 2009 were involved in this study. On the premises that isolated bacteria were only sensitive to colistin or not sensitive to other antibiotics, patients were treated with intravenous drip of colistin (100 x 10(4) - 150 x 10(4) U/d), or intravenous drip combined with administration of the drug into respiratory tract by atomization or instillation (50 x 10(4) - 100 x 10(4) U/d). The bacteriologic and therapeutic effects and side effects (including neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, rise in serum levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen and cystatin C were detected and compared before and after administration) of colistin were observed. RESULTS: Out of 9 patients, 7 patients were with bloodstream and pulmonary infections, 1 patient was with bloodstream, pulmonary, and invasive wound infections, and 1 patient was with bloodstream and urinary tract infections. The pathogenic bacteria were proved to be Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas maltophilia. After the administration of colistin, bacteria clearance rate of blood reached 92.3% in 9 patients; isolation rate of MDR gram-negative bacillus of sputum was significantly decreased in 7 patients with pulmonary infection (before treatment 58.2% v.s. after treatment 14.6%, P < 0.01); a complete MDR gram-negative bacillus clearance of urine was observed in 1 patient with urinary tract infection. Colistin was clinically effective in 8 patients but ineffective in 1 patient (effective rate 88.9%). Compared with those before administration, serum levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen were decreased after administration in all patients; no significant difference in serum level of cystatin C among 8 patients was detected, except an obvious elevation in serum level of cystatin C in 1 patient after colistin therapy, and it lowered 1 month after discontinuation. No neurotoxicity or other side effect was observed during medication and 5 days after discontinuation in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Reasonable application of colistin is a good option for treating infections caused by MDR gram-negative bacillus in patients with severe burn, as no other more effective drug is found.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of aerobic and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections at a medical center in Taiwan: results of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) 2002-2006.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends  (SMART) was initiated to monitor the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of aerobic and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections (IAI). This report summarizes the SMART data from 1 of the study centers from 2002 to 2006. METHODS: 492 Gram-negative isolates were collected from 482 patients with IAI. Susceptibilities of these isolates to 12 antimicrobial agents were determined using the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Enterobacteriaceae comprised 68.3% of the isolates (n = 336). The 4 main species were Klebsiella spp. (n = 129; 26.2%), Escherichia coli (n = 122; 24.8%), Enterobacter spp. (n = 36; 7.3%), and Aeromonas hydrophila (n = 35; 7.1%). The commonest glucose non-fermentative GNB were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 46; 9.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 35; 7.1%). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was detected in 70 Enterobacteriaceae isolates (70/336; 21%). The ESBL phenotype was exhibited by 23% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26% of E. coli, and 19% of Enterobacter spp. The highest rate of ESBL production was found in 2005 for E. coli (38%) and in 2003 for Klebsiella spp. (38%) and Enterobacter spp. (40%). The incidence of ESBL-producing isolates declined in 2005 and 2006. Low susceptibility rates of E. coli isolates to ciprofloxacin (58%) and levofloxacin (64%) were noted. Ertapenem (99%), imipenem (99%), and amikacin (94%) were the most potent agents against Enterobacteriaceae spp. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous surveillance is crucial to monitor the trend of antimicrobial resistance patterns among GNB isolated from IAI.
TI  - Membrane proteomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are known for their intrinsic  resistance to antibiotics. Between mechanisms involved in this resistance, diminished expression of outer membrane proteins and up-regulation of efflux pumps play an important role. The characterization of membrane proteins is consequently necessary because of their importance in the antibiotic resistance but also in virulence. This review presents proteomic investigations aiming to describe the protein content of the membranes of these two bacterial species.
TI  - Comparison of antimicrobial efficacy of a fixed dose combination of ceftazidime + sulbactam with ceftazidime and sulbactam alone against five bacteria.
AB  - The efficacy of the agents was evaluated on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and time-kill curve analysis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Citrobacter braakii; MIC was found to be 0.5, 4.0, 0.015625, 0.0078125, and 0.0625 mg/L in FDC of ceftazidime + sulbactam, respectively, which is lower than ceftazidime and sulbactam individually. Time-kill curve analysis demonstrated maximum killing of bacteria after 4 h. A fixed dose combination of ceftazidime + sulbactam was found to have stronger antibacterial properties than ceftazidime and sulbactam alone at in vitro analysis.
TI  - A novel tetrabranched antimicrobial peptide that neutralizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide and prevents septic shock in vivo.
AB  - We describe the nonnatural antimicrobial peptide KKIRVRLSA (M33) and its capacity to neutralize LPS-induced cytokine release, preventing septic shock in animals infected with bacterial species of clinical interest. M33 showed strong resistance to proteolytic degradation when synthesized in tetrabranched form with 4 peptides linked by a lysine core, making it suitable for use in vivo. HPLC and mass spectrometry demonstrated its stability in serum beyond 24 h. M33 was found to be very selective for gram-negative bacteria. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranged from 0.3 to 3 muM for multidrug resistant clinical isolates of several pathogenic species, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. M33 neutralized LPS derived from P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae, and prevented TNF-alpha release from LPS-activated macrophages, with an EC(50) of 3.8e-8 M and 2.8e-7 M, respectively, as detected by sandwich ELISA. M33 activity was also tested in sepsis animal models. It averted septic shock symptoms due to Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa in doses compatible with clinical use (5-25 mg/kg). These properties make tetrabranched M33 peptide a good candidate for the development of a new antibacterial drug.-Pini, A., Falciani, C., Mantengoli, E., Bindi, S., Brunetti, J., Iozzi, S., Rossolini, G. M., Bracci, L. A novel tetrabranched antimicrobial peptide that neutralizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide and prevents septic shock in vivo.
TI  - Building a benchmark through active surveillance of intensive care unit-acquired  infections: the Italian network SPIN-UTI.
AB  - The Italian Nosocomial Infections Surveillance in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) (SPIN-UTI) project of the Italian Study Group of Hospital Hygiene (GISIO - SItI) was undertaken to ensure standardisation of definitions, data collection and reporting procedures using the Hospital in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance (HELICS)-ICU benchmark. Before starting surveillance, participant ICUs met in order to involve the key stakeholders in the project through participation in planning. Four electronic data forms for web-based data collection were designed. The six-month patient-based prospective survey was undertaken from November 2006 to May 2007, preceded by a one-month surveillance pilot study to assess the overall feasibility of the programme and to determine the time needed and resources for participant hospitals. The SPIN-UTI project included 49 ICUs, 3053 patients with length of stay >2 days and 35 498 patient-days. The cumulative incidence of infections was 19.8 per 100 patients and the incidence density was 17.1 per 1000 patient-days. The most frequently encountered infection type was pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most frequent infection-associated micro-organism, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Site-specific infection rates for pneumonia, bloodstream infections, central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections, stratified according to patient risk factors, were below the 75th centile reported by the HELICS network benchmark. The SPIN-UTI project showed that introduction of ongoing surveillance should be possible in many Italian hospitals. The study provided the opportunity to participate in the HELICS project using benchmark data for comparison and for better understanding of factors influencing risks.
TI  - In vitro activities of antimicrobials against six important species of gram-negative bacteria isolated from raw milk samples in Korea.
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) with multidrug resistance pose a serious threat to public health. They are environmental pathogens frequently isolated from raw milk and mastitis in dairy cattle. This study was to examine the in vitro antimicrobial activities against 225 isolates belonging to six important species of GNB from mastitic raw milk samples of dairy herds in the Republic of Korea: Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 17), Citrobacter freundii (n = 19), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 54), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 55), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 45), and Serratia marcescens (n = 35). In general, amikacin, gentamicin, and piperacillin exhibited strong antimicrobial activities against all bacterial species tested, whereas rifampin, cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin were ineffective against most of the bacterial species tested. Wide differences were observed in the patterns of resistance among the bacterial species; in particular, resistance to kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol was highly variable among the strains belonging to different bacterial species. Almost half of the GNB isolates (45.3%, 102/225) were resistant to 5 or more of 12 antimicrobial agents tested: P. aeruginosa (86.6%, 39/45) showed the highest resistance rate, followed by S. marcescens (65.7%, 23/35). This study indicates that multiple antimicrobial resistances are prevalent among GNB isolates from mastitic milk samples of dairy cattle in the Republic of Korea.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: Of the 17 plant extracts studied, seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The stem bark of B. micrantha and the leaves of D. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. This study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities of some flavonoids.
AB  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of six plant-derived flavonoids representing two different structural groups were evaluated against standard strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and their drug-resistant isolates, as well as fungi (Candida albicans, C. krusei) using the microdilution broth method. Herpes simplex virus Type-1 and Parainfluenza-3 virus were employed for antiviral assessment of the flavonoids using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. Ampicillin, gentamycin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, acyclovir, and oseltamivir were used as the control agents. All tested compounds (32-128 microg/ml) showed strong antimicrobial and antifungal activities against isolated strains of P. aeruginosa, A. baumanni, S. aureus, and C. krusei. Rutin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 5,7,3'-trihydroxy-flavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.2-0.05 microg/ml) were active against PI-3, while 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-[2''-O-(5'''-O-trans-cinnamoyl)-beta-D-apiofuranosyl] -beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.16-0.2 microg/ml) inhibited potently HSV-1.
TI  - Kinetic and theoretical study of the chalcones as inhibitors of beta-lactamase enzyme.
AB  - Staphyloccoccus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and more bacteria have shown resistance to antibiotics in Colombia, therefore, resistance to antibiotics is a problem that is on increase in Colombia. The resistance mechanism to penicillin antibiotics in these bacteria is the expression of beta-Lactamase enzyme. In order to use the penicillin antibiotics which are still effective against them, we had evaluated 10 chalcones as inhibitors of this enzyme. The most active chalcone showed K(m') = 406.7 microM higher than clavulanic acid that showed K(m') = 211.9 microM at 37 degrees C during 10 h, and using amoxycillin as substrate. The chalcones were better competitive inhibitors because of they allowed the hydrolysis of smaller quantity of amoxycillin than the clavulanic acid, the most active chalcone showed K(cat)/K(M) = 1.398 (minM)(-1) and the clavulanic acid showed K(cat)/K(M) = 2.674 (minM)(-1). The molecular modelling of the Enzyme-chalcones complexes showed that the chalcones with electron-donating groups on ortho, meta position of A ring favour the interaction with the residues Threonine-319, Lysine-67, Serine-64 and Tyrosine-150 of the active site of the enzyme, because of the number and strong of Hydrogen bonds of the chalcones in the active site of the enzyme increase, and therefore the affinity of the chalcones increases too. The electron-donating groups in the chalcones contribute to their inductive effect improving the interaction with the active site of the enzyme because of rising of electrostatic attraction between them.
TI  - Role of old antibiotics in multidrug resistant bacterial infections.
AB  - Multidrug resistant bacteria infections are associated with an increase in attributable mortality and morbidity in ICU patients. Unfortunately, an emerging resistance to novel antibiotics used in the therapy of gram negative and gram positive bacteria infections is often reported in literature. Old antibiotics have been reintroduced in clinical practice. In this review we report the efficacy and safety use of older antimicrobial agents in critically ill patients. Polymyxins are used for nosocomial infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii resistant strains. Patients with polymyxin-only susceptible gram-negative nosocomial pneumonia are reported to be successfully treated with inhaled colistin. Isepamicin can probably be used in intensive care units that harbor Gram-negative bacteria resistant to other aminoglycosides. Fosfomycin may be a useful alternative to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin in the treatment of Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) infections in certain clinical situations, e.g. uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Chloramphenicol has a wide antimicrobial spectrum and excellent tissue penetration; though it is sometimes used empirically in the hospital setting for the treatment of patients with unknown source of fever, its role is still a matter of controversy. The colistin/rifampicin combination might have a synergistic effect in Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Fusidic acid is active against staphylococcal strains.
TI  - [Analysis of the molecular epidemiology and distribution of pathogenic bacteria in burn wards of Ruijin Hospital from 2004 to 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the distribution, drug resistance and epidemiology of pathogenic bacteria in the burn wards of Ruijin Hospital. METHODS: Seventeen strains of Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), and 11 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) isolated from the wound secretion, venous catheters, blood, urine and stool etc. were collected from burn patients hospitalized in our department from January 2004 to December 2006. The distribution and the drug resistance profile of bacteria were analyzed, and the homology analysis was performed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). RESULTS: MRSA, PA and AB were the major strains in our burn wards in recent years, of which Staphylococcus aureus (SA) was the most dominant. During these 3 years, MRSA accounted for 77% (63/82), 85% (63/74), and 75% (74/99), respectively, for SA isolated in this period. MRSA was resistant to Amikacin, Gentamicin, Erythromycin, Clindamycin and Levofloxacin; PA was resistant to Amikacin, Gentamicin, Piperacillin, Ceftazidime, Cefoperazone, Aztreonam and Imipenem; AB was resistant to Amikacin, Gentamicin, Piperacillin, Ceftazidime, Imipenem and Ciprofloxacin. Three bacteria were found to belong to the same type in the RAPD homology analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There are many kind of multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria for nosocomial infection in our burn wards. To control the spread of infection due to above-mentioned 3 bacteria is the focus of nosocomial infection control.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii on computer interface surfaces of hospital wards and association with clinical isolates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Computer keyboards and mice are potential reservoirs of nosocomial pathogens, but routine disinfection for non-water-proof computer devices is a problem. With better hand hygiene compliance of health-care workers (HCWs), the impact of these potential sources of contamination on clinical infection needs to be clarified. METHODS: This study was conducted in a 1600-bed medical center of southern Taiwan with 47 wards and 282 computers. With education and monitoring program of hand hygiene for HCWs, the average compliance rate was 74% before our surveillance. We investigated the association of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, three leading hospital-acquired pathogens, from ward computer keyboards, mice and from clinical isolates in non-outbreak period by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and antibiogram. RESULTS: Our results revealed a 17.4% (49/282) contamination rate of these computer devices by S. aureus, Acinetobacter spp. or Pseudomonas spp. The contamination rates of MRSA and A. baumannii in the ward computers were 1.1% and 4.3%, respectively. No P. aeruginosa was isolated. All isolates from computers and clinical specimens at the same ward showed different pulsotypes. However, A. baumannii isolates on two ward computers had the same pulsotype. CONCLUSION: With good hand hygiene compliance, we found relatively low contamination rates of MRSA, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii on ward computer interface, and without further contribution to nosocomial infection. Our results suggested no necessity of routine culture surveillance in non-outbreak situation.
TI  - Non-adherence to guidelines: an avoidable cause of failure of empirical antimicrobial therapy in the presence of difficult-to-treat bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to difficult-to-treat (DTT) bacteria (i.e., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and to assess the rate and the causes of inappropriateness of empirical antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: In an intensive care unit of a university hospital, patients with VAP were empirically treated with antibiotics without activity against DTT bacteria if the patients had no prior hospitalization or prior administration of antibiotics, according to local guidelines. RESULTS: Overall, the empirical antimicrobial therapy was appropriate in 190 (87%) out of 218 patients with VAP. Fifty (23%) patients developed problems due to DTT bacteria. The risk factors for VAP due to DTT bacteria were shock state, prior antimicrobial therapy, prior stay in long-term care facilities and late-onset VAP. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was inappropriate in 20 (40%) patients with VAP due to DTT bacteria and 8 (5%) patients with VAP due to non-DTT (P = 0.001). Guidelines violations (nine patients), bacteria not included in antibiotic spectrum (eight patients) and bacterial resistance (three patients) were the causes of inappropriateness in case of DTT bacteria. CONCLUSION: Despite the abundant information for the treatment of VAP and the establishment of guidelines, too many patients with DTT bacteria received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. Since 45% of the cases are related to non-adherence to the local protocol, there is room for improvement by implementing educational programs. Also, since DTT bacteria are found in 23% of late-onset VAP, empirical antibiotic treatment should be directed against these pathogens.
TI  - Bactericidal activity in filtrated supernatant of Streptococcus sanguinis against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - In the past decade, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) infection has become a serious clinical problem, due to the limitation of drug choices to fight against the bacteria. Here we explored the bactericidal activity in the filtrated supernatant of Streptococcus (S.) sanguinis against Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa. S. sanguinis is one of the alpha-hemolytic streptococci that commonly reside in the human oral cavity. A strain of S. sanguinis, isolated from the sputum of a pulmonary-disease patient, was cultured for overnight. The filtered supernatant was tested for bactericidal effect using the minimum bactericidal concentration method on 20 strains of P. aeruginosa, including two MDRP and five mucoid-type strains. The viable number of P. aeruginosa was decreased with time after exposing to the filtrated supernatant of S. sanguinis, and collapsed bacteria were detected with electron microscopy. Of the 20 strains, 19 (95%) strains of P. aeruginosa were affected by bactericidal effect. Among other species of bacteria examined, the filtrated supernatant of S. sanguinis showed remarkable bactericidal effect on 49% of indole-positive Proteus species (4/9 strains) and 60% of Acinetobacter (A.) baumannii (6/10 strains). We next investigated the property of bactericidal activity in filtrated supernatant by treating with proteinase K or autoclave. There was no change in the bactericidal activity of the filtrated supernatant after each treatment, excluding the involvement of protein and plasmid. Here, we identify the bactericidal activity in the filtrated supernatant of S. sanguinis against MDRP. This unexpected observation may contribute to the development of a novel therapeutic drug against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. Approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. These exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. The association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study during 24 months. SETTING: Eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. PATIENTS: All inpatients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary isolates of six indicator organisms (Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant S. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. Indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. Surveillance of nosocomial infection rates was performed according to the German nosocomial infection surveillance system, Krankenhaus Infektions Surveillance System. Transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate Spearman's rank-correlation test. During 100,781 patient days, 100,829 microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. Altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6 transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. Correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration of hospitalization, or device use. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. Other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of plants from northeast of Mexico.
AB  - Traditional medicine has a key role in health care worldwide. Obtaining scientific information about the efficacy and safety of the plants from our region is one of the goals of our research group. In this report, 17 plants were selected and collected in different localities from northeast Mexico. The dried plants were separated into leaves, flowers, fruit, stems, roots and bark. Each part was extracted with methanol, and 39 crude extracts were prepared. The extracts were tested for their antimicrobial activity using three Gram-negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii), three Gram-positive bacterial strains (Enterococcus faecalis and two Staphylococcus aureus strains), and seven clinically isolated yeasts (Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata); their antioxidant activity was tested using a DPPH free radical assay. No activity against Gram-negative bacteria was observed with any extract up to the maximum concentration tested, 1000 mug ml(-1). We report here for the first time activity of Ceanothus coeruleus against S. aureus (flowers, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 125 mug ml(-1)), C. glabrata (MICs 31.25 mug ml(-1)) and C. parapsilosis (MICs between 31.25 and 125 mug ml(-1)); Chrysanctinia mexicana against C. glabrata (MICs 31.25 mug ml(-1)); Colubrina greggii against E. faecalis (MICs 250 mug ml(-1)) and Cordia boissieri against C. glabrata (MIC 125 mug ml(-1)). Furthermore, this is the first report about antioxidant activity of extracts from Ceanothus coeruleus, Chrysanctinia mexicana, Colubrina greggii and Cyperus alternifolius. Some correlation could exist between antioxidant activity and antiyeast activity against yeasts in the species Ceanothus coeruleus, Schinus molle, Colubrina greggii and Cordia boissieri.
TI  - Description of Streptococcus pneumoniae infections in burn patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Longer survival in burn patients has resulted in more infectious complications, typically with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Staphylococcus aureus. Although Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are common in the community and can cause nosocomial infections, the incidence and risk factors for pneumococcal infections in burn patients is unclear. METHODS: We performed an electronic retrospective chart review to collect rates of and risk factors for S. pneumoniae infections in patients with thermal burns from March 2003 through June 2008. RESULTS: Of the 1838 patients admitted to the burn center, 10 were infected (0.54% incidence). Patients presented with pneumonia (seven patients, 0.38% incidence) and bacteremia (three patients, 0.16% incidence) within a week of initial burn (median 1 day, range 0-8), often in the setting of bacterial co-infection (five patients). This group was mainly young males with median 28.8% total body surface area burns; 60% had concomitant inhalational injury. Most did not have traditional risk factors for pneumococcal infection but had objective signs of infection at time of positive culture and were treated with appropriate antibiotics. Two patients in this series died, although no mortality was attributed to S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal disease is not common in burn patients and generally occurs early on in hospitalization after burn making it more likely to be a community-acquired pathogen rather than nosocomial in the burn population. It should be considered in the setting of sepsis or new pulmonary infiltrates within a week after burn, but typical empiric antibiotics against the usual burn pathogens should be adequate to also treat for pneumococcal infection.
TI  - In vitro activities of moxifloxacin and tigecycline against bacterial isolates associated with intraabdominal infections at a medical center in Taiwan, 2001-2006.
AB  - A total of 569 nonduplicate isolates recovered from patients with community-onset or hospital-onset intraabdominal infections (IAIs) from 2001 to 2006 were studied. These included 28 Staphylococcus aureus and 541 Gram-negative isolates (33.6% Escherichia coli, 29.0% Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8.1% Acinetobacter baumannii, and 6.3% Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the isolates to moxifloxacin, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin were determined using the agar dilution method and to tigecycline using the broth microdilution method. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers were found in 15.5% (29 out of 182) of E. coli, 15.3% (24 out of 157) of K. pneumoniae, and 15.4% (2 out of 13) of K. oxytoca isolates. More than 85% of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to moxifloxacin, but this percentage was lower among E. coli (78%). The percentage of E. coli (K. pneumoniae) isolates that were not susceptible to moxifloxacin was 6% (0%) in 2001, 39% (17%) in 2003, and 21% (14%) in 2006. Tigecycline exhibited good in vitro activities against all S. aureus and >95% of all Enterobacteriaceae tested. Among the 24 isolates of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, 4 had tigecycline MICs > or = 2 microg/ml. Eighty percent of A. baumannii isolates exhibited tigecycline MICs of < or = 2 microg/ml. This study found that moxifloxacin and tigecycline exhibited good in vitro activity against bacterial isolates causing IAIs.
TI  - Beta-lactamase inhibitors: the story so far.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance constitutes one of the major threats regarding pathogenic microorganisms. Gram-negative pathogens, such as Enterobacteriaceae (specially those producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii have acquired an important role in hospital infections, which is of particular concern because of the associated broad spectrum of antibiotic resistance. beta-Lactam antibiotics are considered the most successful antimicrobial agents since the beginning of the antibiotic era. Soon after the introduction of penicillin, microorganisms able to destroy this beta-lactam antibiotic were reported, thus emphasizing the facility of pathogenic microorganisms to develop beta-lactam resistance. In Gram-negative pathogens, beta-lactamase production is the main mechanism involved in acquired beta-lactam resistance. Four classes of beta-lactamases have been described: A, B, C, and D. Classes A, C, and D are enzymes with a serine moiety in the active centre that catalyzes hydrolysis of the beta -lactam ring through an acyl-intermediate of serine, whereas the class B enzymes require a metal cofactor (e.g. zinc in the natural form) to function, and for this reason, they are also referred to as metallo- beta-lactamases (MBLs). To overcome beta-lactamase-mediated resistance, a combination of beta-lactam and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, which protects the beta-lactam antibiotic from the activity of the beta-lactamase, has been widely used in the treatment of human infections. Although there are some very successful combinations of beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors, most of the inhibitors act against class A beta-lactamases and remain ineffective against class B, C, and D beta-lactamases. This review constitutes an update of the current status and knowledge regarding class A to D beta-lactamase inhibitors, as well as a summary of the drug discovery strategy currently used to identify new beta-lactamase inhibitors, mainly based on the knowledge of crystal structure of beta-lactamase enzymes.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections: what are the treatment options?
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacilli creates a challenge in the treatment of nosocomial infections. While the pharmaceutical pipeline is waning, two revived old antibacterials (colistin and fosfomycin), a newer one (tigecycline) and an 'improved' member of an existing class (doripenem) are the only therapeutic options left. The class of polymyxins, known since 1947 and represented mostly by polymyxin B and polymyxin E (colistin), has recently gained a principal role in the treatment of the most problematic MDR Gram-negative pathogens (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). Future prospective studies are needed to answer important clinical questions, such as the possible benefit of combination with other antimicrobials versus monotherapy, the efficacy of colistin in neutropenic hosts and the role of inhaled colistin. As new pharmacokinetic data emerge, clarification of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile of colistin as well as appropriate dosing seems urgent, while development of resistance must be carefully monitored. Fosfomycin tromethamine, a synthetic salt of fosfomycin discovered in 1969, has regained attention because of its in vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and MDR P. aeruginosa. Although in use for decades in oral and parenteral formulations for a variety of infections without significant toxicity, its clinical utility in MDR infections remains to be explored in future studies. Tigecycline, the first representative of the new class of glycylcyclines, holds promise in infections from MDR K. pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae carbapenemase [KPC]- and ESBL-producing strains) and Enterobacteriaceae with various mechanisms of resistance. The in vitro activity of tigecycline against A. baumannii makes it a tempting option, as it is currently the most active compound against MDR strains along with colistin. However, the usual minimum inhibitory concentration values of this pathogen are approximately 2 mg/L and compromise clinical outcomes based on PK/PD issues. Its advantageous penetration into various tissues is useful in infections of the skin and soft tissues as well as intra-abdominal infections (official indications), whereas low serum concentrations compromise its use in bloodstream infections. Therefore, prospective studies with dose escalation are urgently needed, as well as clarification of its role in nosocomial pneumonia, after poor results in the study of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Finally, doripenem, the recently licensed member of the carbapenems (without significant spectrum alterations from the ascendant members) seems to possess a lower potential for resistance selection and a more favourable pharmacokinetic profile when given as an extended infusion. The latter strategy could prove helpful in overcoming low level resistance of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa strains.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Diversity, epidemiology, and genetics of class D beta-lactamases.
AB  - Class D beta-lactamase-mediated resistance to beta-lactams has been increasingly  reported during the last decade. Those enzymes also known as oxacillinases or OXAs are widely distributed among Gram negatives. Genes encoding class D beta-lactamases are known to be intrinsic in many Gram-negative rods, including Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but play a minor role in natural resistance phenotypes. The OXAs (ca. 150 variants reported so far) are characterized by an important genetic diversity and a great heterogeneity in terms of beta-lactam hydrolysis spectrum. The acquired OXAs possess either a narrow spectrum or an expanded spectrum of hydrolysis, including carbapenems in several instances. Acquired class D beta-lactamase genes are mostly associated to class 1 integron or to insertion sequences.
TI  - The clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - The continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital and more recently in the community threatens to seriously compromise our ability to treat serious infections. The major success of the seven-valent Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine at reducing both infection and resistance has been followed by the emergence of previously minor serotypes that express multiresistance. The almost universal activity of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones against community Escherichia coli strains has been compromised by the spread of CTX-M beta-lactamase-producing, fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and the emergence of community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the United States, has forced us to re-think our empirical treatment guidelines for skin and soft-tissue infections. Finally, our most potent and reliable class of antibiotics, the carbapenems, is compromised by the growth, primarily in intensive care units, of multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanni, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The lack of a robust pipeline of new agents, particularly against resistant Gram-negative bacteria, emphasizes the importance of optimizing our use of current antimicrobials and promoting strict adherence to established infection control practices.
TI  - In vitro activity of colistin (polymyxin E) against 3,480 isolates of gram-negative bacilli obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals in the CANWARD study, 2007-2008.
AB  - The in vitro activity of colistin was evaluated versus 3,480 isolates of gram-negative bacilli using CLSI broth microdilution methods. The MIC(90) of colistin was < or = 2 microg/ml against a variety of clinically important gram-negative bacilli, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All multidrug-resistant (n = 76) P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to colistin (MIC, < or = 2 microg/ml). These data support a role for colistin in the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Adjunctive aerosolized antibiotics for treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and microbiologic success in patients receiving adjunctive aerosolized antibiotics for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review. SETTING: Level I trauma intensive care unit of a large academic medical center. PATIENTS: Forty-nine patients (mean +/- SD age 42 +/- 19 yrs) who received aerosolized antibiotics for the treatment of a total of 60 episodes of VAP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Acinetobacter baumannii between January 2001 and July 2007. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were identified by using an existing database of patients with documented VAP at the study center. To receive a diagnosis of VAP, patients had to have bacterial growth of 10(5) or more colony-forming units/ml from a bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage and new or changing infiltrate on chest radiograph, plus at least two of the following: abnormal body temperature (> 38 degrees C or < 36 degrees C), abnormal white blood cell count (> 10 or < 4 x 10(3)/mm(3), or > 10% immature bands), or macroscopically purulent sputum. By reviewing patient data, we evaluated clinical and microbiologic success using standard definitions. The median (interquartile range) Injury Severity Score and admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were 40 (29-45) and 17 (9-21), respectively. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, A. baumannii, or both were isolated in 45, 14, and 1 episode(s), respectively. Eighteen VAP episodes included additional bacteria. Aerosolized tobramycin, amikacin, and colistimethate were used in 44, 9, and 9 episodes, respectively. Systemic antibiotics were used in 59 (98%) of the 60 episodes. Clinical success was achieved in 36 (73%) of the 49 first episodes of VAP, 8 (73%) of 11 subsequent episodes, 17 (85%) of 20 episodes that were failing intravenous monotherapy, and 30 (79%) of 38 episodes with multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii. Microbiologic success was achieved in 29 (71%) of 41 evaluable episodes. Six patients died from VAP. CONCLUSION: Treatment with adjunctive aerosolized antibiotics was associated with a good response rate in critically ill trauma patients with VAP due to nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli. It is noteworthy that episodes of VAP that followed intravenous therapy failure and/or that were due to multidrug-resistant organisms responded well.
TI  - [Quantitative culture sampling of tracheal aspirates for diagnosis of nosocomial  pneumonia in the ITU].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial pneumonia is defined as a pneumonia developing within 48 hours of admission, in a patient with previously normal lung tissue. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to migration of microorganisms from the nose, throat and digestive tract is typical in ITU patients. Microbiological diagnosis is difficult, and there is no single method approved for VAP diagnosis. We have assessed the usefulness of Quantitative Endotracheal Aspirate (QETA) for this purpose, basing on its reported high sensitivity (mean 76% +/- 9%) and specificity (mean 75 +/- 28%). METHODS: Endotracheal aspirates were sampled from ITU patients fulfilling the following criteria: (1) New or progressive infiltrations in the lungs plus hyperthermia (>38.3 degrees C) or hypothermia (<36 degrees C); (2) leukocytosis (>12 G L(-1)) or leukopenia (<4 G L(-1)); or (3) purulent sputum. RESULTS: Nosocomial pneumonia was diagnosed in 40 out of 312 patients treated in the ITU during the study period. VAP was diagnosed in 33 patients. Multi-drug resistant bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16), Acinetobacter baumannii (19), ESBL pathogens (8) and MRSA (1) were cultured from QETA in 32 patients. The sensitivity of QETA was 86%. CONCLUSION: The results allowed for early and accurate diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia and institution of the best possible treatment.
TI  - Accuracy of American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria in predicting infection or colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria at intensive-care unit admission.
AB  - The aim of this prospective observational study was to determine the accuracy of  American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) criteria in predicting infection or colonization related to multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria at intensive-care unit (ICU) admission. MDR bacteria were defined as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime-resistant or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli. Screening for MDR bacteria (using nasal and rectal swabs and tracheal aspirates from intubated patients) was performed at ICU admission. Risk factors for infection or colonization with MDR bacteria at ICU admission were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. The accuracy of ATS/IDSA criteria in predicting infection or colonization with these bacteria at ICU admission was calculated. Eighty-three (13%) of 625 patients were infected or colonized with MDR bacteria at ICU admission. Multivariate analysis allowed identification of prior antimicrobial treatment (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.3; p 0.008), residence in a nursing home (OR 2, 95% CI 1.1-3.7; p <0.001), and prior hospitalization (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.7-8.8; p <0.001) as independent predictors of infection or colonization with MDR bacteria at ICU admission. Although sensitivity (89%) and negative predictive values (96%) were high, low specificity (39%) and a positive predictive value (18%) were found when ATS/IDSA criteria were used in predicting infection or colonization with MDR bacteria at ICU admission. In patients with pneumonia, adherence to guidelines was associated with increased rates of appropriate initial antibiotic treatment and de-escalation. ATS/IDSA criteria had an excellent negative predictive value and a low positive predictive value concerning infection or colonization with MDR bacteria at ICU admission.
TI  - Simple screening tests for detection of carbapenemases in clinical isolates of nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The production of carbapenemases is an important mechanism responsible for the carbapenem resistance. A simple and inexpensive testing method for screening of carbapenemase producers is essential. A prospective study was undertaken to detect metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) and AmpC beta-lactamases in nonfermentative Gram negative bacteria and to evaluate the various methods for detection of carbapenemases and MBLs. METHODS: A total of 100 Acinetobacter spp. (78 A. baumannii and 22 A. lwoffii) and 140 Pseudomonas spp. (103 P. aeruginosa and 37 other Pseudomonas spp.) were screened for meropenem resistance by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Modified Hodge test, EDTA disk synergy (EDS) test and AmpC disk test were used for the detection of carbapenemases, MBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases, respectively. RESULTS: Forty six (59.0%) A. baumannii, 7 (31.8%) A. lwoffii, 32 (31.1%) P. aeruginosa and 7 (18.9%) Pseudomonas spp. were resistant to meropenem. Among the 32 meropenem resistant P. aeruginosa, 15 (46.9%) were AmpC beta-lactamase producers, 16 (50.0%) MBL producers by EDS test, but only 9 (28.1%) found positive for carbapenemases by modified Hodge test. Among the 46 meropenem resistant A. baumannii, 31 (67.4%) were AmpC beta-lactamase producers, 3 (6.5%) MBL producers, but only 1 (14.3%) was positive for carbapenemases by modified Hodge test. One P. aeruginosa was positive for carbapenemase by modified Hodge test, but was negative for MBL and AmpC beta-lactamase. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: MBL production is an important mechanism of carbapenem resistance among Pseudomonas species but not among Acinetobacter species. EDS is more sensitive for detection of MBLs than modifi ed Hodge test. Both EDTA-meropenem and EDTA-ceftazidime combination must be used to detect all the MBL producers. Carbapenemases other than MBL may also be responsible for carbapenem resistance. AmpC beta-lactamase is also a contributory factor for carbapenem resistance among the isolates in the hospital.
TI  - Has the era of untreatable infections arrived?
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern, with fears expressed that we shortly will run out of antibiotics. In reality, the picture is more mixed, improving against some pathogens but worsening against others. Against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)--the highest profile pathogen--the range of treatment options is expanding, with daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline all launched, and telavancin, ceftobiprole, ceftaroline and dalbavancin anticipated. There is a greater problem with enterococci, especially if, as in endocarditis, bactericidal activity is needed and the isolate has high-level aminoglycoside resistance; nevertheless, daptomycin, telavancin and razupenem all offer cidal potential. Against Enterobacteriaceae, the rapid and disturbing spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC enzymes and quinolone resistance is forcing increased reliance on carbapenems, with resistance to these slowly accumulating via the spread of metallo-, KPC and OXA-48 beta-lactamases. Future options overcoming some of these mechanisms include various novel beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations, but none of these overcomes all the carbapenemase types now circulating. Multiresistance that includes carbapenems is much commoner in non-fermenters than in the Enterobacteriaceae, depending mostly on OXA carbapenemases in Acinetobacter baumannii and on combinations of chromosomal mutation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No agent in advanced development has much to offer here, though there is interest in modified, less-toxic, polymyxin derivatives and in the siderophore monobactam BAL30072, which has impressive activity against A. baumannii and members of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. A final and surprising problem is Neisseria gonorrhoeae, where each good oral agent has been eroded in turn and where there is now little in reserve behind the oral oxyimino cephalosporins, to which low-level resistance is emerging.
TI  - Clinical correlation between irrigation bottle contamination and clinical outcomes in post-functional endoscopic sinus surgery patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sinonasal irrigation after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is a common practice, but the role irrigation bottles play in iatrogenic contamination of the operated sinuses is unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether irrigation bottles used postoperatively become contaminated and have any potential association with immediate postsurgical infection and outcomes. METHODS: Patients irrigated twice daily after ESS. Bottle cleaning was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. New bottles were distributed at the time of the operation and at each postoperative visit. During postoperative weeks 1, 2, and 4, bottles were cultured. Medical charts were reviewed for the presence of postsurgical infection and changes in management. RESULTS: Twenty post-ESS patients were enrolled and examined at weeks 1, 2, and 4. A total of 51 bottles were collected and cultured. Overall, 15 of 51 (29%) bottles demonstrated bacterial growth when cultured. During the first two collection periods, 10 of 40 (25%) bottles demonstrated bacterial growth when cultured; however, five of 11 (45%) bottles collected at the last postoperative visit demonstrated bacterial growth when cultured. During the study, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were frequently recovered during the collection periods. Other organisms isolated included Escherichia coli and Enterobacter spp. Although positive bottle cultures were more common at weeks 2 and 4, no postoperative infections occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Irrigation bottles used postoperatively have a measurable incidence of contamination. Contamination rate increases when bottles are used for longer than 1 week, but this does not appear to result in postsurgical infection.
TI  - Antibiotic considerations in the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens: a case-based review.
AB  - The recent rise in antimicrobial resistance among health-care associated pathogens is a growing public health concern. According to the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System, rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in intensive care units have nearly doubled over the last decade. Of equal importance, gram-negative agents such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and extended-spectrum beta lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae demonstrate increasing resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and, in some cases, carbapenems. As a consequence, hospitalists may find themselves utilizing new antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial infections. This case-based review will highlight 8 antibiotics that have emerging clinical indications in treating these multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.
TI  - Frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of the gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in Makkah. METHODS: This study was undertaken in 2 main tertiary care hospitals namely; Al-Noor Specialist Hospital, and Hera Hospital in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from October 2005 to March 2006. A total of 1137 gram-negative bacteria were identified in non-duplicate clinical specimens obtained from 965 patients of various body sites infections. Demographic data, identity of microorganisms, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were obtained from medical and laboratory records. RESULTS: The most prevalent gram-negative bacteria were Escherichia coli (31.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.2%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%), Klebsiella sp. (6.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.7%), Proteus sp. (3.3%), and Enterobacter sp. (1.9%). Results demonstrated that gram-negative bacteria have a high rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Furthermore, multi-drug resistance was also common in this study. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a high rate of resistance among gram-negative pathogens in comparison with other countries in the world. The implementation of monitoring programs is an important part of the prevention strategy against the development of antibiotic resistance in hospitals.
TI  - Intra-abdominal infections: etiology, epidemiology, microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  The etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. in community-acquired IAIs enterobacteria predominate (mostly Escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly Bacteroides fragilis). In nosocomial IAIs, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and Candida spp. Diagnostic microbiology of IAIs is complex and plays a relevant role, especially in some situations (e.g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). Antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing IAIs. Resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.
TI  - Carbapenems and subsequent multiresistant bloodstream infection: does treatment duration matter?
AB  - It has been proposed that initial empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy will result in better clinical outcomes and that shorter courses will reduce the 'collateral damage' of promoting antibiotic resistance. There are few data from Intensive Care Units (ICUs) that support this latter conclusion. A prospective observational study was undertaken at the National University Hospital, Singapore, to examine the relationship between duration of carbapenem therapy and subsequent nosocomial multidrug-resistant (MDR) bloodstream infection (BSI). Over a 2-year period, 415 ICU patients receiving empirical carbapenem therapy were prospectively followed. MDR BSI occurred on 35 occasions in 31 patients, comprising 21 carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, 3 carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 11 meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There was no difference in the duration of carbapenems for those who developed MDR BSI compared with those who did not [median duration 8 days (range 3-23 days) vs. 9 days (range 3-59 days); P=0.78]. On multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model the hazard ratio was 0.935 (P=0.070). In this cohort of critically ill patients, a shorter duration of carbapenem therapy was not shown to protect against subsequent development of MDR BSI. Strategies that depend primarily on reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic duration may be inadequate in preventing the emergence of MDR organisms.
TI  - Ampicillin-sulbactam: an update on the use of parenteral and oral forms in bacterial infections.
AB  - Ampicillin-sulbactam has a wide range of antibacterial activity that includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. However, the drug is not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and pathogens producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. The combination could be considered particularly active against Acinetobacter baumannii infections due to the intrinsic activity of sulbactam. The drug is indicated as empirical therapy for a broad range of community acquired infections supervened in adults or children and is effective in either parenteral (ampicillin-sulbactam) or oral (as a mutual prodrug sultamicillin) form. In clinical trials, sultamicillin has proved clinically and bacteriologically effective in adults and children against a variety of frequently encountered infections, including mild upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, diabetic foot and skin and soft tissue infections. Furthermore, adverse effects rarely occur with the diarrhoea to represent the most commonly reported. The parenteral ampicillin-sulbactam is indicated for community infections of mild-to-moderate severity acquired infections such as intra-abdominal or gynecological. Moreover, it seems to represent the alternative of choice for the treatment of A. baumannii infections for carbapenem-resistant strains in the nosocomial setting. Thus, ampicillin-sulbactam remains a valuable agent in the physician's armamentarium in the management of adult and pediatric infections.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties.
AB  - A series of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties were synthesized starting from 5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thioles 3a-c, X=H, Cl, Br. Thus, alkylation of 1,2,4-triazoles 3 with phenacyl bromide or 4-bromophenacyl bromide afforded S-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles 4, 5. These new intermediates 4 and 5, in the presence of H(2)SO(4) (c), were cyclized to 2-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-(4-Y-phenyl)[1,3]thiazolo[3,2-b]-[1,2,4]-triaz oles 6, 7 (I) and not to isomeric thiazolo[2,3-c][1,2,4]-triazoles 6, 7 (II). The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. MS spectra confirmed the formation of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole 6, 7 (forms I) in detriment of [2,3-c] isomeric compounds (forms II). The potential antibacterial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using standard bacterial strains: Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579.
TI  - Serious antimicrobial resistance status of pathogens causing hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in North China.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns of pathogens causing hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in Shandong Province, China were investigated using data collected from January 2002 to December 2006. A total of 10 337 isolates were characterized in sputum samples from 39 920 LRTI patients: 68.72% were Gram-negative bacteria, 20.65% were Gram-positive bacteria, and 10.62% were fungi. Organisms most frequently isolated were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.88%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.80%), Escherichia coli (10.71%), fungi (10.62%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.68%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (9.03%). Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against Gram-negative bacteria. Most Gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to vancomycin. Susceptibility to cephalosporins was not optimal and resistance to fluoroquinolones was high. Resistance of Gram-negative bacteria showed a rapid increase over the study period, while resistance of Gram-positive bacteria remained relatively stable. The emergence of resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents used against LRTI pathogens has compounded the problem of using empirical therapy and created selective pressure on physicians to use certain antibiotics.
TI  - Association between contaminated faucets and colonization or infection by nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria in intensive care units in Taiwan.
AB  - This study was designed to determine the strength of the association between the  isolation of nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) from tap water faucet aerators and the prevalence of colonization or infection of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Surveillance cultures were obtained during a 4-month period from 162 faucet aerators located in seven different ICUs. The prevalence of colonization or infection of ICU patients with NFGNB was determined by prospective surveillance during the same period. Fifty four (33%) of the faucet aerators contained NFGNB. Among the 66 NFGNB isolated from faucet aerators, the most frequently encountered ones were Sphingomonas paucimobili (26 isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 isolates), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (13 isolates), Achromobacter xylosoxidans (6 isolates), Burkholderia cepacia (4 isolates), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (3 isolates). Acinetobacter baumannii was not recovered. The most common NFGNB isolated from ICU patients were P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. There was a significant correlation between the overall prevalence of NFGNB in faucet aerators and their prevalence in exposed ICU patients (Spearman r = 0.821, P = 0.02). There was also a significant correlation between the prevalence of C. meningosepticum in faucet aerators and its prevalence among ICU patients (Spearman r = 0.847, P = 0.016). The electrokaryotypes of four clinical isolates of C. meningosepticum were similar to those of faucet isolates. Measures directed at making the water supply safe may prevent infection by C. meningosepticum and other waterborne pathogens.
TI  - Continuous-infusion beta-lactam antibiotics during continuous venovenous hemofiltration for the treatment of resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the rationale, principles, and dosage calculations for continuous-infusion beta-lactam antibiotics to treat multidrug-resistant bacteria in patients undergoing continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1968-November 2008) of the English-language literature was performed using the terms continuous infusion and Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter; hemofiltration or CVVH or hemodiafiltration or CVVHDF or continuous renal replacement therapy or pharmacokinetics; and terms describing different beta-lactam antibiotics. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: In vitro, in vivo, and human studies were evaluated that used continuous-infusion beta-lactam antibiotics to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii infections. Studies were reviewed that described the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam antibiotics during CVVH as well as other modalities of continuous renal replacement therapy. DATA SYNTHESIS: Continuous infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics, maintaining drug concentrations 4-5 times higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration, is a promising approach for managing infections caused by P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Safe yet effective continuous infusion therapy is made difficult by the occurrence of acute renal failure and the need for renal replacement therapy. Case series and pharmacokinetic properties indicate that several beta-lactam antimicrobials that have been studied for continuous infusion, such as cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, ticarcillin, clavulanic acid, and tazobactam, are significantly cleared by hemofiltration. Methodology and formulas are provided that allow practitioners to calculate dosage regimens and reach target drug concentrations for continuous beta-lactam antibiotic infusions during CVVH based on a literature review, pharmacokinetic principles, and our experience at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics may be a useful treatment strategy for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections in the intensive care unit. Well-established pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles can be used to safely reach and maintain steady-state target concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics in critical illness complicated by acute renal failure requiring CVVH.
TI  - Mixture model to assess the extent of cross-transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens in hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Creation of a mixture model based on Poisson processes for assessment  of the extent of cross-transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens in the hospital. METHODS: We propose a 2-component mixture of Poisson processes to describe the time series of detected cases of colonization. The first component describes the admission process of patients with colonization, and the second describes the cross-transmission. The data set used to illustrate the method consists of the routinely collected records for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii over a period of 3 years in a German tertiary care hospital. RESULTS: For MRSA and multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, cross-transmission was estimated to be responsible for more than 80% of cases; for imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, cross-transmission was estimated to be responsible for 59% of cases. For new cases observed within a window of less than 28 days for MRSA and multidrug-resistant A. baumannii or 40 days for imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, there was a 50% or greater probability that the cause was cross-transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method offers a solution to assessing of the extent of cross-transmission, which can be of clinical use. The method can be applied using freely available software (the package FlexMix in R) and it requires relatively little data.
TI  - Nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli infections in a tertiary care hospital in kolar, karnataka.
AB  - AIM: Nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB), which are saprophytic in nature, have emerged as important healthcare-associated pathogens. They exhibit resistance not only to beta lactam and the other groups of antibiotics, but also to carbapenems. This study was undertaken to identify the nonfermenters isolated from various clinical samples, to assess their clinical significance, to know the type of healthcare-associated infections they caused, and to know their anti-microbial sensitivity pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The nonfermenters were identified using a standard protocol that included tests for motility, oxidase production, oxidation-fermentation test for various sugars, gelatin liquefaction, and growth on 10% lactose agar. The clinical significance was assessed by using various criteria and susceptibility testing was performed with the help of the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: A total of 193 NFGNB were isolated from 189 clinical specimens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common nonfermenter, accounting for 53.8%, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (22.2%), and Pseudomonas fluorescens (10.8%). Other significant NFGNB isolated were: Sphingobacterium species (5.2%), Acinetobacter lwoffii (3.1%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2.6%). P. aeruginosa showed good sensitivity to imipenem (94%), cefoperazone (70%), amikacin (69%), and ticarcillin (63%). A. baumannii showed 100% sensitivity to imipenem and 70% sensitivity to piperacillin. CONCLUSION: P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were the common NFGNB isolated in our study from patients of, urinary tract infection, bacteremia, surgical site infections, and ventilator associated pneumonia. P. aeruginosa showed good sensitivity to imipenem, amikacin, and cefoperazone while A. baumannii showed good sensitivity to imipenem and piperacillin.
TI  - Oral care interventions and oropharyngeal colonization in children receiving mechanical ventilation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent progress in identification of oral microorganisms has shown that the oropharynx can be a site of origin for dissemination of pathogenic organisms to distant body sites, such as the lungs. OBJECTIVE: To compare the oropharyngeal microbiological profile, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of stay in the intensive care unit of children receiving mechanical ventilation who had pharmacological or nonpharmacological oral care. METHODS: A randomized and controlled study was performed in a pediatric intensive unit in Sao Paulo, Brazil. A total of 56 children were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=27, 48%) that received oral care with use of 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate or a control group (n=29, 52%) that received oral care without an antiseptic. Oropharyngeal secretions were collected and cultured on days 0, 2, and 4, and at discharge. RESULTS: The 2 groups had similar demographic characteristics, preexisting underlying diseases, and pharmacological, nutritional, and ventilatory support. Gram-negative bacteria were the predominant pathogens: Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enter-obacter species. The 2 groups did not differ significantly in the colonization of normal (P= .72) or pathogenic (P= .62) flora, in the duration of mechanical ventilation (P= .67), or in length of stay in the intensive care (P= .22). CONCLUSION: Use of chlorhexidine combined with nonpharmacological oral care did not decrease the colonization profile, duration of mechanical ventilation, or length of stay in critically ill children receiving mechanical ventilation.
TI  - Advances in antibacterial therapy against emerging bacterial pathogens.
AB  - During the last decade, both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to most or all available antibacterial classes have become increasingly prevalent nosocomial pathogens, particularly among immunocompromised patients and those hospitalized in intensive care units. Among gram-positive bacteria, increasing concerns are posed for health care- and community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), S aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). A spectrum of newer antibacterial agents has been developed for the treatment of multi-resistant gram-positive bacteria, such as linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, and novel glycopeptides. Gram-negative bacteria have also developed multidrug resistance (MDR), which in the Enterobacteriacae is commonly due to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases of VIM, IMP, or KPC types. Currently, non-fermenting bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are commonly resistant to all available antibiotics, including the newer agents. Colistin retains activity against most P aeruginosa and A baumannii, but its clinical use remains questionable, while newer carbapenems and tigecycline have limited additional advantages. Rational use of newer antibacterial agents coupled with enhanced infection control measures may be able to sufficiently control MDR organisms as to allow hematological patients to recover from serious infectious complications.
TI  - Spectrum of practice in the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in patients requiring mechanical ventilation in European intensive care units.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Information on clinical practice regarding the diagnosis of pneumonia in European intensive care units is limited. The aim of this study was to describe the spectrum of actual diagnostic practices in a large sample of European intensive care units. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, multicenter study. SETTING: Twenty-seven intensive care units of nine European countries. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for an admission diagnosis of pneumonia or receiving mechanical ventilation for >48 hrs irrespective of admission diagnosis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 2,436 patients were evaluated; 827 were admitted with or developed nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired pneumonia [HAP], 27.1%; ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP], 56.2%; very early onset VAP, 16.7%). Mean age was 59.4 +/- 18.1 yrs, 65.0% were men, and mean admission Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was 46.7 +/- 17.1. Worsening oxygenation (76.8%), purulent/changing respiratory secretions (72.1%), and new temperature elevation (69.2%) were the most frequent clinical signs of nosocomial pneumonia. Etiological diagnosis was based on noninvasive respiratory specimens in 74.8% of episodes. Bronchoscopy was performed in 23.3% of episodes. Bronchoscopy performance, after adjustment by severity of illness, age, and type of hospital, were predicted by worsening oxygenation (odds ratio 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-3.24) and male sex (odds ratio 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.65). Definite cause was documented in 69.5% of nosocomial pneumonia cases. The most common isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (16.3% methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 16.0% methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (19.1%). Presence of nosocomial pneumonia significantly prolonged mean length of mechanical ventilation (10.3 days, p < .05) and mean intensive care unit length of stay (12.2 days, p < .05) in intensive care unit survivors. Mortality rate was 37.7% for nosocomial pneumonia vs. 31.6% for patients without pneumonia (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Etiological diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in a large sample of European intensive care units was based mainly on noninvasive techniques. However, there was high variability in bronchoscopy use between the participating intensive care units.
TI  - The relative roles of bacteria and host inflammatory cells in SIgA degradation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Secretory Immunoglobulin (Ig) A, the most important Ig for lung defense, is highly dependent on its molecular structure for its immune activity. Proteolytic cleavage of SIgA may occur in the airways and render the SIgA molecule inactive. Previous studies have attributed IgA cleavage to neutrophils (polymorphonucleur cells [PMNs]) and other host immunoinflammatory cells in the airways or bacterial pathogens. The resultant IgA degradation leads to airway inflammation and subsequent pneumonia. The aim of this study was to discern the relative roles of host inflammatory cells and bacteria in SIgA cleavage in vitro. METHODS: SIgA was cocultured with PMNs, PMNs activated with fMLP, monocytes, monocytes pretreated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas, or Acinetobacter alone or with monocyte culture supernatants and PMNs. SIgA cleavage resulted in two fractions, a <75 kDa fraction (secretory component fraction) and an intact SIgA fraction by size exclusion ultrafiltration. This was quantified by ELISA and confirmed by SDS-PAGE. RESULTS: Neither naive nor activated PMNs showed any cleavage of SIgA. Unstimulated monocytes or LPS stimulated monocytes also failed to demonstrate fragmentation of SIgA. Only modest SIgA cleavage was noted when both PMNs and monocytes were stimulated before coculture with SIgA but marked SIgA proteolysis was noted with the addition of Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter but not MRSA. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial pathogens, but not activated immunoinflammatory cells, were responsible for SIgA degradation in this study. This was evident only with Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. This may be a virulence factor for pneumonia with these pathogens in vivo.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus does not impact sensitivity to human beta defensin 4.
AB  - Antibiotic usage is essential for infection control but hastens emergence of antibiotic resistant microbes. In particular, Acinetobacter baumannii is an important pathogen because of its heightened ability to acquire drug resistance. The need for novel antibacterial agents led us to evaluate the sensitivity of drug-resistant bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of human beta defensin 4 (HBD-4). Clinical isolates of A. baumannii (N=14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=15), and Staphylococcus aureus (N=20), including 10 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) isolates, were examined. All bacterial strains were susceptible to HBD-4 antimicrobial activity, with no correlation between antibiotic resistance and HBD-4 sensitivity. The results demonstrate that antibiotic resistant microorganisms, including MRSA, can be inhibited by HBD-4, which may represent an effective therapeutic agent for infections involving drug-resistant microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activity of Flindersine isolated from the traditional medicinal plant, Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The leaves and root of Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam. (Rutaceae) are widely used as a folk medicine in India. Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol and water extracts of Toddalia asiatica leaves and isolated compound Flindersine were tested against bacteria and fungi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial and antifungal activities were tested against bacteria and fungi using disc-diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The compound was confirmed using X-ray crystallography technique. RESULTS: Antibacterial and antifungal activities were observed in ethyl acetate extract. One active principle Flindersine (2,6-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-5H-pyrano [3,2-c] quinoline-5-one-9cl) was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract. The MIC values of the compound against bacteria Bacillus subtilis (31.25 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (62.5 microg/ml), Staphylococcus epidermidis (62.5 microg/ml), Enterococcus faecalis (31.25 microg/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (250 microg/ml), Acinetobacter baumannii (125 microg/ml) and fungi Trichophyton rubrum 57 (62.5 microg/ml), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (62.5 microg/ml), Trichophyton simii (62.5 microg/ml), Epidermophyton floccosum (62.5 microg/ml), Magnaporthe grisea (250 microg/ml) and Candida albicans (250 microg/ml) were determined. CONCLUSIONS: Ethyl acetate extract showed promising antibacterial and antifungal activity and isolated compound Flindersine showed moderate activity against bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Design and quality control of a pharmaceutical formulation containing natural products with antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant properties.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to determine the antibacterial and antifungal  activity as well as mutagenicity of Sechium edule fluid extract and to obtain a pharmaceutical formulation with them. The extract exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. isolated from clinical samples from two hospitals of Tucuman, Argentina. Non-toxicity and mutagenicity on both Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA 100 strains until 100 microg/plate were observed. A hydrogel with carbopol acrylic acid polymer containing S. edule fluid extract as antibacterial, antimycotic and antioxidant agent was obtained. Microbiological, physical and functional stability of pharmaceutical formulation conserved at room temperature for 1 year were determined. Addition of antioxidant preservatives to store the pharmaceutical formulation was not necessary. The semisolid system showed antimicrobial activity against all gram positive and gram negative bacteria and fungi assayed. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 20 to 800 microg/mL. Its activity was compared with a pharmaceutical formulation containing commercial antibiotic and antifungal. A pseudoplastic behavior and positive thixotropy were observed. Our current finding shows an antimicrobial activity of hydrogel containing S. edule extract on a large range of gram negative and gram positive multi-resistant bacteria and fungi. This topical formulation may be used as antimycotic and as antibacterial in cutaneous infections.
TI  - A longitudinal analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility in clinical institutions  in Germany as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (2004-2007).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) global surveillance program has been designed to assess the in vitro activity of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent tigecycline plus several comparative agents. METHODS: In vitro activities of bacterial isolates obtained from 13 centers in Germany between 2004 and 2007 were evaluated longitudinally and pooled, using the interpretive criteria of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). RESULTS: Tigecycline demonstrated good activity against both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens monitored in this study [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) 0.06-2 microg/ml] with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had elevated MICs for most antimicrobial agents. Imipenem and meropenem also showed good activity (MIC(90) <or=0.06-4 microg/ml) against most Gram-negative pathogens but were less active against Gram-positive organisms (MIC(90) <or=0.12 to >or=32 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens monitored in the T.E.S.T. study. A low tigecycline MIC(90) was reported against Acinetobacter baumannii and drug-resistant Enterococcus faecium,Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The carbapenems showed the lowest MIC(90) values against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive E. coli. E. coli susceptibility to most antimicrobial agents decreased over the course of this study.
TI  - In-vitro bactericidal activity of colistin against biofilm-associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  
TI  - Silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coatings: antibacterial activity and surface analysis.
AB  - The colonisation of clinical and industrial surfaces with pathogenic microorganisms has prompted increased research into the development of effective antibacterial and antifouling coatings. There is evidence that implanted biomedical surfaces coated with metallic silver can be inactivated by physiological fluids, thus reducing the bioactivity of the coating. In this work, we report the biofilm inhibition of Staphylococcus epidermidis using a room temperature processed silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coating. The release of silver ions from these fluoropolymers over a six-day period inhibited bacterial encrustation - as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated differences in carbon, fluorine and sodium surface composition between silver doped and undoped fluoropolymers after exposure to nutrient rich media. These silver doped perfluoropolyether coatings also exhibited antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii; suggesting potential use in preventing transmission of pathogenic and opportunistic microbes on environmental surfaces in healthcare facilities. The broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of these silver release coatings may be exploited on biomaterials surfaces to combat the development of resistant Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae that can occur during prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections.
TI  - Fosfomycin for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli: a systematic review of microbiological, animal and clinical studies.
AB  - The treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant or pandrug-resistant non-fermenting Gram-negative bacterial infections constitutes a challenge in an era of few new antibiotic choices. This mandates the re-evaluation of already existing antibiotics such as fosfomycin. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the clinical and microbiological effectiveness of fosfomycin in the treatment of these infections by searching PubMed, Scopus and the Cochrane Library databases. In 23 microbiological studies identified, 1859 MDR non-fermenting Gram-negative bacterial isolates were examined. The susceptibility rate to fosfomycin of MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates was >or=90% and 50-90% in 7/19 and 4/19 relevant studies, respectively. Cumulatively, 511/1693 (30.2%) MDR P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. Serotype O12 isolates exhibited greater susceptibility. Only 3/85 (3.5%) MDR Acinetobacter baumannii and 0/31 MDR Burkholderia spp. isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. Variable criteria of susceptibility were used in the included studies. Fosfomycin was synergistic in combination with a beta-lactam, aminoglycoside or ciprofloxacin in 46/86 (53.5%) MDR P. aeruginosa isolates. One animal study found a good therapeutic effect of the combination fosfomycin/gentamicin against MDR P. aeruginosa endocarditis. In six clinical studies, 33 patients with MDR P. aeruginosa infections (mainly pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis) received fosfomycin (25/33 in combination with other antibiotics); 91% of the patients clinically improved. In conclusion, fosfomycin could have a role as a therapeutic option against MDR P. aeruginosa infections. Further research is needed to clarify the potential utility of this agent.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of tigecycline and comparators against bacterial isolates collected as part of the TEST study in Europe (2004-2007).
AB  - Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections. The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is a global, longitudinal surveillance study established in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against key Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. This report examines data obtained for 24748 isolates collected across 24 European countries between 2004 and 2007. Tigecycline, meropenem and imipenem were the most active antimicrobial agents against most Gram-negative isolates including multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (15.7% of the A. baumannii isolates in this study), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (8.5% of E. coli) and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.6% of K. pneumoniae). Only amikacin was active against >90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (92.8% susceptible). Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were the most active agents against Gram-positive agents across Europe between 2004 and 2007, with tigecycline displaying the lowest MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (26.5% of the collected S. aureus isolates), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (15.7% of the E. faecium strains) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.3% of the S. pneumoniae strains). Longitudinal analysis showed no increase in tigecycline MIC values over the 4-year study period, whilst increased resistance was noted for several comparator agents.
TI  - [Colistin use in ventilator-associated pneumonia due to panresistant Pseudomonas  aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii].
AB  - Nosocomial infections by resistant gram-negative microorganisms are important causes of mortality in intensive care unit (ICU)'s. The treatment choices are limited in infections due to Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially if they are panresistant. In these type of resistant infections, colistin--an old antibiotic--has become a current issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of colistin in 9 cases (6 males, mean age 75.8 +/- 9.4 years), with ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by panresistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa in respiratory ICU. All cases were referred to ICU from other hospitals or clinics. It was detected that 7 of 9 cases were treated with anti-pseudomonal antibiotics before the development of VAP. Panresistant A. baumannii was isolated in 5 cases and P. aeruginosa in 4 cases. VAP by these microorganisms was detected on the 26.6 +/- 12.4th days of invasive mechanical ventilation and the cases were followed up for 54.2 +/- 25.7 days in ICU. During colistin treatment, dermatitis (one case) and nephrotoxicity (one case) were observed as side effects. Microbiological response to colistin was obtained in 6 cases. Three cases died due to non-eradication of panresistant microorganisms and three cases died due to other infections during ICU follow-up. The data presented in this study demonstrates that colistin can be considered as a safe and effective antibiotic in the treatment of panresistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections.
TI  - Success of an infection control program to reduce the spread of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of enhanced infection control measures with screening for gastrointestinal colonization on limiting the spread of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in a New York City hospital endemic for this pathogen. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study with pre- and postinterventional phases. METHODS: Beginning in 2006, a comprehensive infection control program was instituted in a 10-bed medical and surgical intensive care unit at a university-based medical center. In addition to being placed in contact isolation, all patients colonized or infected with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were cohorted to one end of the unit. Improved decontamination of hands and environmental surfaces was encouraged. In addition, routine rectal surveillance cultures were screened for the presence of carbapenem-resistant pathogens. The number of patients per quarter with clinical cultures positive for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae was compared during the approximately 2-year periods before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The mean number (+/-SD) of new patients per 1,000 patient-days per quarter with cultures yielding carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae decreased from 9.7 +/- 2.2 before the intervention to 3.7 +/- 1.6 after the intervention (P < .001). There was no change in the mean number of patient-days or the mean number of patients per quarter with cultures yielding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, or carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa after the intervention. There was no association between antibiotic usage patterns and carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive intervention that combined intensified infection control measures with routine rectal surveillance cultures was helpful in reducing the incidence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in an intensive care unit where strains producing the carbapenemase KPC were endemic.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  - Acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. The main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused by organisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (Betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (Lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (Hibicet). Former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus group A and B. The tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. The microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested at a low concentration of 3%. In comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. An evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic acid is currently underway. It can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.
TI  - Catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  - Urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the Institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, Centre for paraplegia of the Clinical Centre of the University of Sarajevo, were included. The patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: Group A (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; Group B (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; Group C (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. From a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. More than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. The overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. Infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. The vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by Gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. Providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by Proteus mirabilis (16,3%), Escherichia coli (11,8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), Morganella morgani (5,4%), Acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), Providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were Gram-positive with Enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among Acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), Providencia rettgeri (86,7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85,4%), Providencia stuarti (84,3%) and Morganella morgani (81,0%). Lower rates of resistance were found in Group C, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. Eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. Significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. The analysis of Group C showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two Groups of patients. The objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. In addition, possible correlations between UTI and the type of bladder management were examined.
TI  - Geraniol restores antibiotic activities against multidrug-resistant isolates from gram-negative species.
AB  - The essential oil of Helichrysum italicum significantly reduces the multidrug resistance of Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Combinations of the two most active fractions of the essential oil with each other or with phenylalanine arginine beta-naphthylamide yield synergistic activity. Geraniol, a component of one fraction, significantly increased the efficacy of beta-lactams, quinolones, and chloramphenicol.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of doripenem and other carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other nonfermentative bacilli, and Aeromonas spp.
AB  - The in vitro activity of doripenem against prevalent nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli and Aeromonas spp. was evaluated. The collection comprised 14979 nonduplicate clinical isolates submitted during a global Doripenem Surveillance Program conducted from 2003 through 2007. Susceptibility tests were performed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution method and the susceptibility criteria of the US Food and Drug Administration. Doripenem (MIC(90), 8 and 4 microg/mL) was 2-fold more potent than imipenem (MIC(90), >8 and 8 microg/mL) and meropenem (MIC(90), >8 and 8 microg/mL) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., covering 77.2% and 82.9% of the isolates, respectively, at the breakpoint of <or=2 microg/mL. Against Acinetobacter spp., including Acinetobacter baumannii, imipenem showed slightly greater activity and potency (2-fold) than other carbapenems, though only 41.8% of A. baumannii were susceptible at breakpoint. Doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem exhibited similar and near-complete coverage (98.2-98.8% at <or=4 microg/mL) against Aeromonas spp. Rates of susceptibility to doripenem among P. aeruginosa isolates varied by geographic region, being highest in North America and lowest in Latin America (84.9% and 67.2% inhibited at <or=2 microg/mL, respectively). Infections caused by nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli and Aeromonas spp. often occur in severely debilitated patients and may be associated with poor clinical outcomes; moreover, these organisms have a significant capacity to develop resistance. Given the limited treatment choices available, doripenem appears to offer potency and an enhanced spectrum of activity usable against these troublesome pathogens, particularly against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance analysis of bacteria in different wound infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the distribution and drug resistance of bacteria in different wound infections and provide evidence for wound infection control in subtropical regions. METHODS: This study involved 265 patients from 4 different departments of our hospital who experienced wound infections between July, 2007 and July, 2008. The bacterial strain distribution in the wounds and drug resistance of the bacteria were analyzed. RESULTS: Acinetobacter baumanii (39% of the total strain identified) was the most frequent bacterial strain causing infection of the burn wounds, followed by Proteus mirabilis (20%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). E. coli infection was prevalent in the departments of general surgery (37%) and urinary surgery (64%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas pneumonia infections were detected at the rate of 30% and 43% in the urinary surgery department, respectively. Different bacterial strains were found at similar rates around 10% in the wounds of patients undergoing traumatic surgery. CONCLUSION: Despite that the commonly seen pathogenic bacteria in burn patients including Staphylococcus aureus have been effectively controlled by early application of antibiotics, the opportunistic pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Proteus mirabilis often survive these antibiotics, and some strains evolve to be drug-resistant and even multi-drug-resistant. E. coli infection is prevalent in general surgery and urinary surgery departments, where Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections can also be found frequently. All kinds of bacteria infection are present in trauma surgery department, each found at the rate around 10%.
TI  - [Bacteriological profile and antibiotic resistance of bacteria isolates in a burn department].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections remain the main cause of morbidity and mortality in burn patients. Ongoing surveillance of infections in burned patients is essential to detect changes in epidemiology and to guide better empirical antibiotherapy and infection control policies. The aim of this study is to analyze the bacterial flora and the antibiotic resistance of isolates in a burn department during a two year period METHODS: From 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2006, 1268 strains were isolated from different specimens. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been carried out by disk diffusion method as referred to the French Society of Microbiology. All data were stored in a laboratory data base using whonet 5.3 software. Duplicate isolates defined as the same bacterial species for the same patient with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile were excluded. RESULTS: The most frequently identified species were Staphylococcus aureus (19.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.8%), Acinetobacter baumannii (11.8%), Providencia stuarttii. The rate of meticillin resistant S. aureus was 68.1%, all isolates were fully susceptibles to glycopeptide. P. aeruginosa resistance was 35.6% and 35.4% respectively for ceftazidime and imipenem. Concerning A. baumannii, 98.7% of strains were resistant to ceftazidime, 59.5% to imipenem and 87.5% to ciprofloxacin. 77.3% of P. stuarttii isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and were producing extended spectrum, lactamase (ESBL). The frequencies of resistance to ceftazidime, of loxacin and amikacin of K. pneumoniae were respectively 60.9%, 25.4% and 47.1%. CONCLUSION: Comparatively to the previous years, S. aureus still be the commonest pathogen in the burn department. The incidence of antimicrobial resistance has decreased during 2006 after a peak of multiresistance during 2005. Our results should be helpful in providing useful information regarding antimicrobial resistance among the burn isolates and this will help in formulation of effective guideline for therapy.
TI  - [Surveillance of multidrug resistant bacteria in a Tunisian hospital].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlling antibiotic resistance of bacteria is a priority for public healthcare. AIM: This study concerned the frequency of multidrug resistant bacteria (MDRB) in a Tunisian Hospital with the aim of establishing guidelines for MDRB prevention. METHODS: The study was conducted during two years (1 January 2005-31 December 2006). Samples collected for the clinical diagnostic were included. The MDRB concerned were: methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA), Enterobacteriacae resistant to of third generation cephalosporin (ER3GC), Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to both imipenem and ceftazidime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to both imipenem and ceftazidime. RESULTS: During the study period, 2475 bacteria were tested by disk diffusion. 597 MDRB were collected, the rate of MBR was 24.1%. These MDRB were mainly recovered in burn unit (82.6%). ER3GC (47%) and MRSA (29,2%) were the most frequent MDRB. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa multiresistant concerned 14,8% and 9% of MDRB. MDRB were isolated mainly from blood cultures (45%). The rate of MRSA was 46.4% among 375 strains of S. aureus. ER3GC represented 25,6% among 1096 isolates. Concerning A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, 51.7% and 20.5% were resistant to both imipenem and ceftazidime among 170 and 264 isolates. Antibiotic resistance evolution showed a decrease of resistance in 2006 versus 2005. This decrease should be explained by the improvement of hygiene measure especially hand washing with the introduction of hydro- alcoholic solutions, a better targeted antibiotherapy promoted by a close cooperation between microbiologists and clinicians. CONCLUSION: The MDRB were frequent in our hospital. They were mainly isolated from the burn department. The measures of prevention already implemented are effective and must be strengthened with the continuous surveillance of MDRB.
TI  - Inhibition of Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation with a class of TAGE-triazole conjugates.
AB  - A chemically diverse library of TAGE-triazole conjugates was synthesized utilizing click chemistry on the TAGE scaffold. This library of small molecules was screened for anti-biofilm activity and found to possess the ability of inhibiting biofilm formation against Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One such compound in this library demonstrated the most potent inhibitory effect against Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation that has been displayed by any 2-aminoimidazole derivative.
TI  - Gallium maltolate treatment eradicates Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in thermally injured mice.
AB  - Gallium (Ga) is a semimetallic element that has demonstrated therapeutic and diagnostic-imaging potential in a number of disease settings, including cancer and infectious diseases. Gallium's biological actions stem from its ionic radius being almost the same as that of ferric iron (Fe(3+)), whereby it can replace iron (Fe) in Fe(3+)-dependent biological systems, such as bacterial and mammalian Fe transporters and Fe(3+)-containing enzymes. Unlike Fe(3+), ionic gallium (Ga(3+)) cannot be reduced, and when incorporated, it inactivates Fe(3+)-dependent reduction and oxidation processes that are necessary for bacterial and mammalian cell proliferation. Most pathogenic bacteria require Fe for growth and function, and the availability of Fe in the host or environment can greatly enhance virulence. We examined whether gallium maltolate (GaM), a novel formulation of Ga, had antibacterial activity in a thermally injured acute infection mouse model. Dose-response studies indicated that a GaM dose as low as 25 mg/kg of body weight delivered subcutaneously was sufficient to provide 100% survival in a lethal P. aeruginosa-infected thermally injured mouse model. Mice treated with 100 mg/kg GaM had undetectable levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in their wounds, livers, and spleens, while the wounds of untreated mice were colonized with over 10(8) P. aeruginosa CFU/g of tissue and their livers and spleens were colonized with over 10(5) P. aeruginosa CFU/g of tissue. GaM also significantly reduced the colonization of Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii in the wounds of thermally injured mice. Furthermore, GaM was also therapeutically effective in preventing preestablished P. aeruginosa infections at the site of the injury from spreading systemically. Taken together, our data suggest that GaM is potentially a novel antibacterial agent for the prevention and treatment of wound infections following thermal injury.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling to predict in vivo effectiveness of various dosing regimens of piperacillin/tazobactam and piperacillin monotherapy against gram-negative pulmonary isolates from patients managed in intensive care units in 2002.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of piperacillin/tazobactam (PTZ) combination treatment with those of piperacillin (PIP) monotherapy against clinical gram-negative pulmonary isolates from US patients treated in intensive care units. METHODS: Computer modeling was used to integrate national in vitro microbiologic data from 2002 with pharmacokinetic data from published studies in healthy volunteers. PTZ (3.375 g q4h, 3.375 g q6h, 4.5 g q6h, and 4.5 g q8h) and PIP (3 g q4h, 3 g q6h, 4 g q6h, and 4 g q8h) were modeled using Monte Carlo simulations. The cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was determined for percentage of time that the free serum concentration remained above the MIC of >or=30% (bacteriostatic) and >or=50% (bactericidal). Because simulated comparisons with an artificially derived sample size were used, statistical methods were not applied. RESULTS: Overall, 2584 gram-negative pulmonary isolates were evaluated, including Enterobacteriaceae (n = 1430), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 799), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 179), and "other" (n = 176). The percents susceptible with PTZ and PIP were as follows: Enterobacteriaceae, 86% and 66%, respectively; P aeruginosa, 89% and 84%; and A baumannii, 47% and 34%. CFR rates with PTZ were numerically higher than those with PIP against Enterobacteriaceae (ranges, 86%-89% and 66%-73%, respectively) and A baumannii (47%-53% and 33%-42%), but not against P aeruginosa (79%-84% and 75%-81%). CONCLUSION: Results from PK/PD models with Monte Carlo simulation suggested that susceptibility differences among these selected gram-negative isolates collected in 2002 may be of sufficient magnitude to result in notable PK/PD differences between PTZ and PIP.
TI  - Tigecycline in combination with other antimicrobials: a review of in vitro, animal and case report studies.
AB  - Tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. In vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). Nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp. and Brucella melitensis isolates. Combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. Moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic Acinetobacter baumannii and Proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against K. pneumoniae. Data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against Enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against K. pneumoniae bacteraemia and P. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. Antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. Thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.
TI  - [Investigation of the effect of efflux pump inhibitors to MIC values of ciprofloxacin in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of efflux pump inhibitors on the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of ciprofloxacin (CIP) in fluoroquinolone-resistant 42 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 42), Escherichia coil (n= 97), Acinetobacter baumannii (n= 58) and Staphylococcus aureus (n= 80) strains isolated from clinical specimens. For this purpose phenylalanyl-arginyl-beta-naphthylamide (PA beta N) was used for P. aeruginosa, E. coli, A. baumannii and reserpine for S. aureus isolates as pump inhibitors. Fluoroquinolone resistance of the clinical isolates were determined by VITEK2 Compact (BioMerieux, France) automated system and confirmed with standard broth microdilution method. For the investigation of the effects of inhibitor agents, the MIC values were also determined in the presence of 25 microg/ml and 100 microg/ml PA beta N and 20 microg/ml reserpine. In the presence of 25 mg/l PA beta N, 61.9% of CIP resistant P. aeruginosa strains converted to susceptible ones, while this rate was 73.8% in the presence of 100 mg/l PA beta N. In A. baumannii clinical isolates, 8.6% and 15.5% of CIP-resistant strains have become susceptible in the presence of 25 mg/l and 100 mg/l PA beta N, respectively. Similarly the MIC values for CIP have decreased > or = 4 folds in 42.2%, and > or = 2 folds in 30.9% of E. coli isolates, in the presence of 25 mg/l PA beta N, however, there was no change in MICs of 26.9% of E. coli strains. The MIC values have also been lowered for > or = 4 folds in 83.6%, and two folds in 13.4% of E. coli strains by the use of 100 mg/l PA beta N concentration, however, no decrease in MIC values was detected in 3% of the isolates. 20 mg/l of reserpine have caused a decrease of > or = 4 folds in 8.75%, and two folds in 33.75% of S. aureus isolates, while there was no change in MIC values of 57.5% of S. aureus strains. Our results showed that PA beta N causes significant reduction in MIC values for CIP in the clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, E. coli and A. baumannii and this effect may be attributed to efflux pump inhibition. In contrast, it was concluded that reserpine does not have a considerable effect on the MIC values of S. aureus against ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Resistance to newer beta-lactams and related ESBL types in gram-negative nosocomial isolates in Turkish hospitals: results of the multicentre HITIT study].
AB  - Increasing resistance due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and multiple resistance mechanisms in gram-negative hospital isolates restrict the role of beta-lactam antibiotics in empirical treatment of serious infections. As the prevalence of ESBL producing strains and resistance rates to antimicrobial agents can vary in each center, local surveillance studies are required to guide therapy. In this study, in vitro rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam were evaluated in 1196 gram-negative hospital isolates in a multicenter in vitro study with the participation of six different centers in Turkey between the period of June 2004-January 2005. The isolates included Escherichia coli (n= 457), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n= 390), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 194) and Acinetobacter boumannii (n= 155). In addition, frequency of ESBL production and types of enzymes were determined in blood isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae. MICs and ESBL production were investigated by E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna) and the results were evaluated by using CLSI breakpoints. PCR analysis was used for typing of the ESBLs. In E. coli, 26% and in K. pneumoniae 32% of the isolates were ESBL producers. Among the blood isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, 31.7% and 33.3% produced ESBLs, respectively. CTX-M (71.4%) was the most prevalent enzyme, followed by TEM (49.4%) and SHV (46.7%) derived enzymes. CTX-M-15 (69.4%) was the most frequent CTX-M type in blood isolates followed by CTX-M-3 (28.6%) and CTX-M-1 (2%). Resistance to imipenem was not observed in E. coli isolates, however it was 1.3% in K. pneumoniae, 28.9% in P. aeruginosa and 52.2% in A. baumannii strains. Resistance to cefoperazone/sulbactam was found as 6%, 17.7%, 27.9% and 41.3% in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates, respectively, whereas resistance rates to piperacillin/tazobactam were 10.2%, 22.3%, 22.7% and 78.7%, respectively. These results indicate that ESBL production and rates of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics are high in hospital isolates of gram-negative bacteria in Turkey, however, they show variations in different hospitals and CTX-M enzymes are prevalent in these isolates.
TI  - Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria from food-producing animals are low risk for hospital-acquired infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate possible indications of epidemiological  relationships between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from food-producing animals and those of clinical origin. Screening for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates from food-producing animals was carried out on 1381 samples. Susceptibility testing and PCR amplification of resistance genes were determined. Isolate clonal relatedness was established by PFGE. Forty-one P. aeruginosa and 16 A. baumannii were detected. All P. aeruginosa isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam and seven isolates had low-level imipenem resistance. All A. baumannii isolates were sensitive to imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam but were resistant to ceftazidime. The imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant A. baumannii had different PFGE patterns compared to those of human origin. Based on the findings presented here, animal isolates were not multidrug resistant and they do belong to a different pool from those of humans.
TI  - Inhaled colistin as monotherapy for multidrug-resistant gram (-) nosocomial pneumonia: a case series.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reports of patients with polymyxin-only susceptible gram-negative nosocomial pneumonia treated with inhaled, but without concurrent intravenous, colistin are rare. METHODS: Patients admitted in a tertiary 450-bed tertiary care centre during the period 05/01/2005-05/31/2007 and receiving colistin through nebulization, but not systemically, were included in this retrospective case series. RESULTS: Five patients (three with ventilator-associated pneumonia and two with nosocomial pneumonia) received colistin through nebulization without concomitant intravenous colistin. The isolated pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii (three cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one case) and the combination of Klebsiella pneumoniae, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa (one case). They were susceptible only to colistin (three cases) or to colistin and gentamicin (two cases). Intravenous antimicrobial agents given concurrently were piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin; isolated pathogens were resistant to these agents. Four (80%) out of the five patients were cured, survived and were discharged. One patient died. No colistin-related adverse event was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The experience from this case series and other relevant recent reports suggest that treatment of pneumonia due to polymyxin-only susceptible gram-negative bacilli with inhaled colistin (without concurrent systemic administration) deserves further careful investigation.
TI  - Intravenous colistimethate (colistin) use in critically ill children without cystic fibrosis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The increasing frequency of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria has led to the reappraisal of colistimethate use. METHODS: We present a case series of critically ill pediatric patients without cystic fibrosis who received intravenous colistimethate treatment. All available relevant medical records were reviewed. RESULTS: Seven children without cystic fibrosis (mean age 7.7 years; 2 female), admitted to the intensive care unit of a tertiary-care pediatric hospital in Athens, Greece, were identified to have received intravenous colistimethate during October 2004 to May 2008. MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and/or Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from blood and/or bronchial secretions specimens in 6 of 7 reported patients. All isolates were susceptible to colistin. All 7 patients received intravenous colistimethate in a dosage of 5 mg/kg daily (divided in 3 equal doses, administered every 8 hours). Five children received colistimethate for 10 days and the remaining 2 for 2 and 23 days, respectively. The infections caused by MDR Gram-negative bacteria were improved in 6 children with microbiologically documented infections. Five of the 7 children were discharged from the ICU. The remaining 2 children died (1 of them had received colistimethate for 2 days); their death was not attributed to MDR Gram-negative infection. No nephrotoxicity or other type of toxicity of colistimethate was noted in this case-series. CONCLUSIONS: Although the small number of included cases precludes any firm conclusions, our study suggests that colistimethate may have a role for the treatment of infections caused by MDR Gram-negative bacteria in critically ill pediatric patients.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of gramnegative nosocomial pathogens in Minsk ICUs].
AB  - The species pattern and antibiotic resistance of gramnegative isolates from patients with nosocomial infections in Minsk ICUs were studied. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were the main pathogens, highly resistant to the antibiotics used. Imipenem, meropenem, polymyxin B, ampicillin/sulbactam, amikacin and cefoperazone/sulbactam were the most active antimicrobials against the isolates. The choice of antimicrobials for empirical therapy of hospital infections in ICUs should be based on the local situation regarding the antibiotic resistance, that makes it obligatory to use regular microbiological monitoring in all hospitals thus providing the policy of the use of antimicrobials in ICUs.
TI  - [Role of endotoxin in pathomechanism of sepsis].
AB  - The nosocomial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, in this number Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have severe course and relatively high prevalence of sepsis cases. Pathomechanism of sepsis is related to activation and release of bacterial endotoxin, which is a macromolecule engaged in initiation of cytokine cascade. These mediators are responsible for heavy tissues and organs devastation. Factors that bind and neutralize endotoxin in organism are promising candidates for experimental therapy of sepsis.
TI  - Microarray of DNA-protein complexes on poly-3-hydroxybutyrate surface for pathogen detection.
AB  - A novel strategy was developed for the specific immobilization of DNA probes on poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) surface by using the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of PHB depolymerase as an active binding motif. To demonstrate whether this method can be used for the detection of clinical pathogens, the pathogen-specific biotin-labeled DNA probes were immobilized via core streptavidin (cSA) fused to the SBD. The pathogen-specific 15-mer oligonucleotide probes were designed for four model pathogens, while the target DNAs were prepared by PCR using universal primers. The complex of pathogen-specific probes and cSA-SBD fusion protein was immobilized on the PHB-coated slide by microspotting. This DNA-protein complex microarray was able to successfully diagnose Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, the specific pathogens could be diagnosed in the presence of other microorganisms. Thus, the DNA-protein complex microarray platform technology employing PHB and the SBD reported here can be widely used for the detection of DNA-DNA and DNA-biomolecule interactions without synthetic or chemical modification of biomolecules or solid surface.
TI  - [Bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. The objective of this study was to explore application of the combined detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. METHODS: Totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. The age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. Deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by Streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, Hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. The aspirate samples were also amplified for DNA of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Tem-PCR) and detected with Luminex xMAP technology platform. RESULTS: The total positive rate by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. The total positive rate by combined detection of culture and Tem-PCR assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSION: The Tem-PCR assay may increase the detection rate of Hemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The Combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. The Tem-PCR needs further improvement for diagnosis of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [Changes of pathogens and susceptibility to antibiotics in hematology ward from years 2001 to 2005].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the changes of pathogens in hematological ward and susceptibility of patients received chemotherapy to antibiotics. The pathogens were taken from blood, urine and sputum of patients who accepted chemotherapy from years 2001 to 2005, then were isolated and identified. The susceptibility test was performed by disk diffusion method. The results showed that the total of 418 strains were detected. Gram-negative bacteria were the most common of nosocomial infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli account for the most of Gram negative- bacteria infection and most resistant to broad-spectrum penicillin, Acinetobacter baumannii showed a trend of increase. The ratios of gram positive bacteria and fungi were increased slowly, mainly as Enterococcus and Candida. Enterococcus is the most common cause of Gram-positive bacterial infection. Vancomycin resistance did not occur. It is concluded that Gram-negative bacteria are main cause of nosocomial infection in patients with hematological malignancies. Gram positive bacteria and fungi had been more frequent. Strains resistant to antimicrobial agents increase.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamases in Gram-negative bacteria: introducing the era of pan-resistance?
AB  - Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are being reported with increasing frequency and from several countries worldwide and are becoming the prevalent and most clinically significant determinants of carbapenem resistance. Furthermore, MBL-producing strains that exhibit a pan-resistant phenotype are increasingly detected. Initially MBLs were detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however nowadays they are frequently found in Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae. MBLs spread easily on plasmids and cause nosocomial infections and outbreaks with excess mortality. Such infections mainly concern patients admitted to Intensive Care Units with several co-morbidities and a history of prolonged administration of antibiotics. MBL-producing strains exhibit resistance to almost all currently available antibiotics. In vitro studies reveal that tigecycline and colistin are the only antibacterial agents with consistent activity against MBL-producing strains. Randomised controlled trials are required in order to evaluate the available therapeutic regimens, including treatment combinations. Tigecycline and colistin should be used under appropriate prescribing practices. Surveillance to monitor the emergence of resistance to these agents as well as implementation of infection control measures should be strengthened. MBL inhibitors are urgently needed, however, none is in late pre-clinical development.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria in Intensive Care Units in Taiwan: SMART programme data 2005.
AB  - A nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibilities of glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria isolates was conducted from 1 September 2005 to 30 November 2005 in Taiwan. A total of 456 isolates were recovered from patients hospitalised in the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of ten major teaching hospitals. Rates of resistant pathogens, such as ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%) and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (25%), were higher than those reported in 2000 (8% and 22%, respectively). Increased rates of isolates with resistant phenotypes correlated with prolonged length of ICU stay (48h to <or=7 days vs. >7 days) for ceftazidime-non-susceptible P. aeruginosa (20.0% and 29.7%, respectively), imipenem-non-susceptible P. aeruginosa (4.0% and 13.5%, respectively) and imipenem-non-susceptible A. baumannii (15.4% and 29.8%, respectively), but not for ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa. Alarming rates of emergence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii (15%) and XDR P. aeruginosa (1.8%) were found, particularly among those isolates that were not susceptible to tigecycline and colistin. Interhospital dissemination of some clones of XDR A. baumannii in different ICUs was also noted. This study illustrates the crucial nature of continuous nationwide surveillance of resistant pathogens and implementation of effective strategies for ICU infection control and antibiotic restriction.
TI  - Comparative pharmacodynamics for intravenous antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria in Europe between 2002 and 2006: a report from the OPTAMA program.
AB  - The Optimizing Pharmacodynamic Target Attainment using the MYSTIC Antibiogram (OPTAMA) Program has been used globally to estimate antimicrobial exposures for either targeted pathogens or disease states. Herein, we utilised this methodology to determine antimicrobial exposures of cefepime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam against European-derived isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained in 2006 and compared these with results from 2002. All regimens, except ciprofloxacin, provided optimal pharmacodynamic exposures against E. coli, whereas more regional differences were noted with K. pneumoniae. For K. pneumoniae, the carbapenems provided the highest likelihood of optimal exposures. Ciprofloxacin exposures were also noted to be low for both P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Moreover, for these two organisms higher doses and/or prolonged infusion of the studied beta-lactams was necessary to obtain the desired pharmacodynamic targets. These data reveal regional differences in the probability of pharmacodynamic optimisation as well as the potential utility of employing regimens utilising higher doses and/or prolonged infusion techniques when directing therapy against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.
TI  - Genotype and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - Rapid and accurate identification of the drug susceptibility profile of clinical  strains is very important for controlling bacterial infections and determining the antibiotic therapy. The objective of this study was to investigate the spectrum of the correlation between phenotypic and genetic characters of the drug-resistant clinical isolates. A total of 133 clinical isolates, including 76 Acinetobacter baumannii and 57 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined for their antibiotic susceptibility by the method of disc diffusion. Among them, most of the isolates were multiresistant, and 80% of the strains showed phenotypic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Using PCR analysis, among the several types of beta-lactamases, TEM was the most prevalent, and OXA was the second most prevalent. The integron harbored was identified by conserved segment PCR, and 50% of the test isolates carried integrons with various gene cassette sizes inserted. The results obtained from this study reveal that the majority of these isolates displayed multiple drug resistance phenotypes that were associated with their mutational gene profiles.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in Europe and its potential impact on empirical therapy.
AB  - The problem of microbial drug resistance is a major public health concern, due to its global dimension and alarming magnitude, although the epidemiology of resistance can exhibit remarkable geographical variability and rapid temporal evolution. The major resistance issues overall are those related to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Europe is not free from any of these issues, although their impact may be significantly different in different countries. MRSA rates are high in several European countries, but seem to have levelled off in some settings. Diffusion of VRE is still irregular. The most alarming resistance trends are those observed for Enterobacteriaceae and the Gram-negative non-fermenters, with a generalized increase in rates of resistance to the most important anti-Gram-negative agents (beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones) and the circulation of strains showing multidrug resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Antimicrobial drug resistance in Taiwan.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide, but marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial pathogens are found between countries and in different patient settings, especially in Asia. In Taiwan, the strikingly high prevalence of resistance to macrolides and streptogramins in clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria correlates with the widespread use of these agents in the medical and farming communities. The relatively low proportion of enterococci that are resistant to glycopeptides does not equate to the high use of glycopeptides and extended-spectrum beta-lactams in hospitals. The emerging problem of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates is substantial, and some unique enzymes have been found. Recently, Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii) that are resistant to nearly all available antimicrobial agents, including carbapenems, have emerged.
TI  - [Diagnostic and therapeutic management of Gram-negative infections].
AB  - Among Gram negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing strains, Acinetobacter spp, in particular the multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are the most implicated micrororganisms in the ever more increasing problem of bacterial resistance. Possible solutions have to be searched, on one hand, in the use of new drugs but, on the other hand, in the re-evaluation of those already available drugs, possibly considering a new role for old drugs such as colistine and fosfomycin. Concerning ESBL-producing strains, the most recent data provided by EARSS report, in Italy, an incidence rate of 10-25 percent. The insurgence of an infection sustained by an ESBL+ve strain is strictly related to some well known risk factors, like the hospital stay itself, the disease severity, the length of stay in ICU, intubation and mechanical ventilation, catheterization, urinary or artery, and the past exposure to antibiotics. The raise in ESBL producing strains is closely related to the increasing use of cephalosporins. In the setting of a Gram negative infection, the combination therapy guarantees a higher coverage by reducing insurgence of possible resistance mechanisms, possibly resulting synergistic, and allowing a de-escalation therapy, although to this latter other problems, such as tolerability, costs and compliance, can be related. Another basic aspect to take into account of, in order to achieve the maximal efficacy of the antibiotic treatment, is the right dosage. In the idea to look for the best approach for the antibiotic treatment of a severe infection in a hospital setting, when a Gram negative aetiology is implicated, it can be possibly presumed that the right way consists in avoiding inappropriate antibiotic therapies, making therapeutic choices based on guidelines resulted from local epidemiological data, initiating the therapy promptly, avoiding excessive use of antibiotics, possibly modifying therapy at the light of clinical data and microbiological results (de-escalation).
TI  - "Future" threat of gram-negative resistance in Singapore.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria is challenging the treatment of serious nosocomial infections. This is an international trend that is mirrored in Singapore too. Reports of strains resistant to all currently available agents have surfaced here and possibly have taken root here as well. The direst situation is among the non-fermenters, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. This is followed closely by the Enterobacteriaceae family with their array of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases and carbapenemases. There are also resistance mechanisms such as efflux pumps and porins downregulation that effect resistance against multiple classes of agents. Potentiating these developments is the dwindling "pipeline" of new agents. Hence, there is a real concern that we are running out of options for our patients. Novel antibiotic combinations, enhanced infection control, antibiotic cycling, computer-assisted programmes, and maybe in the distant future, non-antimicrobial agents is all that we have.
TI  - Ertapenem for treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteraemia.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Imipenem and meropenem are treatment of choice for extended-spectrum betalactamase (ESBL)-positive gram-negative bacteraemia. They may select for carbapenemresistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; ertapenem may not do so as it is inactive against these bacteria. Clinical efficacy of ertapenem in ESBL-producing gramnegative bacteraemia is limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with ESBL-positive gram-negative bacteraemia treated with ertapenem was undertaken. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteraemia (79% produced ESBL) were treated with ertapenem for a median duration of 11 days. The median age was 70 years. Septic shock occurred in 19% and mechanical ventilation was needed in 17%. Klebsiella pneumoniae comprised 53% and Escherichia coli 26%. Urinary infection accounted for 61% and hepatobiliary 15%. Favourable clinical response occurred in 96%. Attributable mortality was 4%. CONCLUSION: Ertapenem is promising in culture-guided step-down therapy of ESBL-positive gram-negative bacteraemia.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacilli: a Singapore perspective.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacilli is an area of increasing importance. This prospective study was performed to survey antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli (E. coli), Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. over a 1-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-duplicate isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. were collected from participating Singapore hospitals during defined collection periods in 2006 and 2007. Confirmatory identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed at Changi General Hospital. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) to a defined panel of antibiotics were determined using microbroth dilution methods. The presence of extended-spectrum beta lactamases and AmpC beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae was determined by phenotypic methods, and susceptibility results were defined using current breakpoints from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty-six gram-negative bacilli were received for testing. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was present in a third of Enterobacteriaceae isolates, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) carriage was present in 19.6% and 30.1% of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. AmpC enzymes were also detected in 8.5% and 5.6% of E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates respectively. All Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. The most active antibiotics against P. aeruginosa were amikacin, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. A third of P. aeruginosa showed reduced susceptibility to polymyxin B. Carbapenem resistance was significantly higher in Acinetobacter baumannii (70.5%) than in other Acinetobacter species (25.0%). The most active antibiotic against A. baumannii was polymyxin B. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance is prevalent in gram-negative bacilli isolated from Singapore hospitals. The MIC testing surveillance programme complemented susceptibility data from wider laboratory-based surveillance, and has revealed emerging mechanisms of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Summer Peaks in the Incidences of Gram-Negative Bacterial Infection Among Hospitalized Patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recognition of seasonal trends in hospital infections may improve diagnosis, use of empirical therapy, and infection prevention interventions. There are very few data available regarding the seasonal variability of these infections. We quantified the seasonal variation in the incidences of hospital infection caused by common bacterial pathogens and estimated the association between temperature changes and infection rates. METHODS: A cohort of all adult patients admitted to the University of Maryland Medical Center during the period from 1998 through 2005 was analyzed. Time-series analyses were used to estimate the association of the number of infections per month caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci with season and temperature, while controlling for long-term trends. RESULTS: There were 218,594 admissions to the index hospital, and analysis of 26,624 unique clinical cultures that grew the organisms of interest identified increases in the mean monthly rates of infection caused by P. aeruginosa (28% of isolates recovered; P ! .01), E. cloacae (46%; P ! .01), E. coli (12%; P ! .01), and A. baumannii (21%; Pp.06). For each 10 degrees F increase, we observed a 17% increase in the monthly rates of infection caused by P. aeruginosa (Pp.01) and A. baumanii (Pp.05). CONCLUSION: Significantly higher rates of gram-negative infection were observed during the summer months, compared with other seasons. For some pathogens, higher temperatures were associated with higher infection rates, independent of seasonality. These findings have important implications for infection prevention, such as enhanced surveillance during the warmer months, and for choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy among hospitalized adults. Future, quasi-experimental investigations of gram-negative infection prevention initiatives should control for seasonal variation.
TI  - Nosocomial spread of armA-mediated high-level aminoglycoside resistance in Enterobacteriaceae isolates producing CTX-M-3 beta-lactamase in a cancer hospital in Bulgaria.
AB  - 1,310 Enterobacteriaceae, 242 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 97 Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates collected at a cancer hospital in Bulgaria were screened for the presence of 16S rRNA methylases. The armA methylase gene was identified in 20 (1.5%) Enterobacteriaceae (7 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 Escherichia coli, 3 Serratia marcescens, 3 Citrobacter freundii , 3 Enterobacter cloacae and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca). ArmA-mediated aminoglycoside resistance was transferable by conjugation and carried by closely related IncL/M plasmids which also carried ant3"9, dfrXII, sul1, bla(TEM-1), and bla(CTX-M-3) genes encoding resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin, trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and ss-lactams, respectively. Most of the isolates were genetically different according to PFGE but shared similar restriction patterns of the armA -encoding plasmids. Our findings highlight the strong association of armA and bla(CTX-M-3) extended-spectrum ss-lactamase genes across various species in the family Enterobacteriaceae . The spread of multiresistant isolates expressing 16S rRNA methylases and ESBLs is a worrisome development requiring continuous monitoring.
TI  - [Nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  - We conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout Japan according to the special survey plan to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral CPFX. Results of the first special survey (2001) were already reported in this journal. The current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout Japan to determine susceptibility to CPFX and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between January and June 2005. The results of CPFX in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. The minimum inhibitory concentration of CPFX at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. However, the CPFX-susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. For Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC90 of CPFX tended to increase with time. The CPFX-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for P. aeruginosa and 67.9% for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for CPFX, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. These susceptibility rates for CPFX were similar to the rates for cefozopran and imipenem. These values generally indicated favorable CPFX susceptibility testing results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of CPFX particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of E. coli, M. morganii, and P. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.
TI  - Emergence of extensively drug-resistant and pandrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in Europe.
AB  - International and local surveillance networks as well as numerous reports in the  biomedical literature provide evidence that the prevalence of antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria is escalating in many European countries. Furthermore, isolates characterised as multidrug-resistant (i.e. resistant to three or more classes of antimicrobials), extensively drug resistant (i.e. resistant to all but one or two classes) or pandrug-resistant (i.e. resistant to all available classes) are increasingly frequently isolated in hospitalised patients causing infections for which no adequate therapeutic options exist. Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae are specifically addressed in this review as the most problematic and often extensively or pandrug-resistant pathogens. According to the available multicentre surveillance studies, the proportion of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii strains is reported to be as high as 85% in bloodstream isolates from intensive care unit patients in Greece and 48% in clinical isolates from hospitalised patients in Spain and Turkey. Among 33 European countries participating in the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) in 2007, six countries reported carbapenem resistance rates of more than 25% among P. aeruginosa isolates, the highest rate reported from Greece (51%). According to EARSS, Greece has also the highest resistance rates among K. pneumoniae; 46% to carbapenems, 58% to quinolones and 63% to third generation cephalosporins. This review describes the magnitude of antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria in Europe highlighting where the efforts of the scientific communities, the academia, the industry and the government should focus in order to confront this threat.
TI  - Tackling antibiotic resistance: a dose of common antisense?
AB  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents undermines our ability to treat bacterial infections. It attracts intense media and political interest and impacts on personal health and costs to health infrastructures. Bacteria have developed resistance to all licensed antibacterial agents, and their ability to become resistant to unlicensed agents is often demonstrated during the development process. Conventional approaches to antimicrobial development, involving modification of existing agents or production of synthetic derivatives, are unlikely to deliver the range or type of drugs that will be needed to meet all future requirements. Although many companies are seeking novel targets, further radical approaches to both antimicrobial design and the reversal of resistance are now urgently required. In this article, we discuss 'antisense' (or 'antigene') strategies to inhibit resistance mechanisms at the genetic level. These offer an innovative approach to a global problem and could be used to restore the efficacy of clinically proven agents. Moreover, this strategy has the potential to overcome critical resistances, not only in the so-called 'superbugs' (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but in resistant strains of any bacterial species.
TI  - A study on nosocomial pathogens in ICU with special reference to multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (ICU). Present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from ICU causing nosocomial infections. Special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter. METHODS: The clinical specimens obtained from ICU, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. Acinetobacter isolates were identified by API2ONE system. Antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by double dilution agar plate method. The plasmid profile of 26 antibiotic resistant isolates of Acinetobacter was studied. Curing of R-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing A. baumannii isolates. Plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. RESULTS: Major infections found in ICU were due to Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). Acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. More than 90 per cent isolates of Acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. Plasmid profile of Acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. Ethidium bromide cured plasmids pUPI280, pUPI281, pUPI282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pUPI280, pUPI281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. Transformation frequency of E. coli HB101 with pUPI281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid DNA. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: A. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. A. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from ICU. Antibiotic sensitivity of A. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. Transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from Acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. Therefore, it is very important to target Acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.
TI  - The evolution of drug-resistant microorganisms in patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) tend to become reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance. We assessed antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms in the respiratory tracts of patients receiving PMV. METHODS: Over a 6-month period, the microorganisms from tracheal aspirates of PMV patients with lower airway infection were analyzed. RESULTS: Antimicrobial use was greatest during the acute critical stage of respiratory failure. Antimicrobial resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae peaked during the fourth to 15th weeks of PMV. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) developed rapidly during the first 3 weeks of PMV. The acquisition of multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa and MRSA were significantly correlated with previous exposure to ceftazidime (odds ratio [OR] = 121.3 and 72.5; P = .01 and .01, respectively). The rise of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was significantly correlated with previous exposure to piperacillin/tazobactam (OR = 26.81; P = .02) and imipenem (OR = 16.91; P = .03). Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, the lower respiratory tract infections with multidrug-resistant microorganisms were independently associated with increased 6-month mortality (OR = 3.41; P < .01). CONCLUSION: In patients receiving PMV, lower respiratory tract infection with multidrug-resistant microorganisms is common and is associated with higher mortality.
TI  - NHSN annual update: antimicrobial-resistant pathogens associated with healthcare-associated infections: annual summary of data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006-2007.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency of selected antimicrobial resistance patterns among pathogens causing device-associated and procedure-associated healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) reported by hospitals in the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). METHODS: Data are included on HAIs (ie, central line-associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections) reported to the Patient Safety Component of the NHSN between January 2006 and October 2007. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of up to 3 pathogenic isolates per HAI by a hospital were evaluated to define antimicrobial-resistance in the pathogenic isolates. The pooled mean proportions of pathogenic isolates interpreted as resistant to selected antimicrobial agents were calculated by type of HAI and overall. The incidence rates of specific device-associated infections were calculated for selected antimicrobial-resistant pathogens according to type of patient care area; the variability in the reported rates is described. RESULTS: Overall, 463 hospitals reported 1 or more HAIs: 412 (89%) were general acute care hospitals, and 309 (67%) had 200-1,000 beds. There were 28,502 HAIs reported among 25,384 patients. The 10 most common pathogens (accounting for 84% of any HAIs) were coagulase-negative staphylococci (15%), Staphylococcus aureus (15%), Enterococcus species (12%), Candida species (11%), Escherichia coli (10%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%), Enterobacter species (5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (3%), and Klebsiella oxytoca (2%). The pooled mean proportion of pathogenic isolates resistant to antimicrobial agents varied significantly across types of HAI for some pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. As many as 16% of all HAIs were associated with the following multidrug-resistant pathogens: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (8% of HAIs), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (4%), carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (2%), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae (1%), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli (0.5%), and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and E. coli (0.5%). Nationwide, the majority of units reported no HAIs due to these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis and antibiofilm activity of a second-generation reverse-amide oroidin library: a structure-activity relationship study.
AB  - A second-generation library of 2-aminoimidazole-based derivatives incorporating a "reversed amide" (RA) motif in comparison to the marine natural product oroidin were synthesized and subsequently assayed for antibiofilm activity against the medically relevant Gram-negative proteobacteria P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Most notably, an in-depth activity profile is reported for the most active subclass of derivatives that bear linear aliphatic chains off the amide bond. Additionally, further structural modifications of the core template, such as removal of the amide bond or substitution with a triazole isostere, resulted in the discovery of analogues with antibiofilm activities that varied with respect to their inhibition and dispersal properties of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii biofilms.
TI  - Colistin monotherapy vs. combination therapy: evidence from microbiological, animal and clinical studies.
AB  - Colistin is commonly the last resort for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In clinical practice, it is frequently used as combination therapy in order to improve its antibacterial activity, despite the consequent increase in toxicity. The available evidence from various studies (microbiological, animal and clinical studies, retrieved from the PubMed and Scopus databases) regarding the comparative effectiveness of colistin monotherapy and colistin combination therapy was evaluated. Most of the microbiological studies examined colistin monotherapy vs. combinations with rifampicin (nine studies) or carbapenems (three studies) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii infections. A synergistic effect was detected in all the studies examining the combination of colistin and rifampicin, whereas carbapenems exhibited a synergistic effect in two of three studies. Most of the animal studies examined colistin monotherapy vs. combinations with rifampicin, carbenicillin, piperacillin and imipenem for treatment of P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii or Escherichia coli infections. Mortality rates were significantly lower in the combination treatment arm in three of six relevant studies. However, data from the small number (four) of relevant human studies suggest non-inferiority of colistin monotherapy as compared with combination therapy. In conclusion, microbiological studies suggest superiority of colistin combination treatment, which is in contrast to preliminary data from studies in humans. Results from animal study data are equivocal. There is an urgent need for appropriately designed and powered clinical trials addressing this apparently controversial situation.
TI  - Non-susceptibility trends among Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria from bacteraemias in the UK and Ireland, 2001-06.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. are important opportunists, notorious for resistance. Pseudomonas spp. are collected in the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) bacteraemia surveillance, with Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia well represented in the 'other Gram-negatives' group. METHODS: Data for collected isolates were reviewed together with LabBase bacteraemia reports to the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Isolates with unusual resistances were subjected to molecular investigation. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2006, the BSAC surveillance collected 1226 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 240 Acinetobacter spp.-125 of them Acinetobacter calcoaceticus/baumannii (Acb) complex-and 165 S. maltophilia. Among P. aeruginosa, non-susceptibility rates to beta-lactams and gentamicin fluctuated, without trend, below 10%; those to ciprofloxacin ranged from 16% to 22%. One P. aeruginosa isolate from 2001 had VIM-2 metallo-beta-lactamase. For Acb, the BSAC data indicated frequent non-susceptibility, except to imipenem, where only five non-susceptible isolates were collected, all after 2003, four of them belonging to the OXA-23 clone 1 lineage which is prevalent in Southeast England. Reports to the HPA indicated rising imipenem non-susceptibility in Acb (P < 0.0001). Co-trimoxazole retained near-universal activity against S. maltophilia. Among new antibiotics, doripenem MICs were </=4 mg/L for most imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa but >/=16 mg/L for Acb OXA-23 clone 1. Ceftobiprole had higher MICs than ceftazidime for P. aeruginosa, but 81% of the isolates were inhibited at </=4 mg/L. Tigecycline had activity against most Acb, including OXA-23 clone 1, and also against S. maltophilia. CONCLUSIONS: Most P. aeruginosa from bacteraemias in the UK and Ireland remain relatively susceptible by international standards; in contrast, multiresistance is widespread in Acb, with imipenem non-susceptibility emerging.
TI  - Sitafloxacin hydrate for bacterial infections.
AB  - Sitafloxacin hydrate (DU-6859a, Gracevit), a new-generation, broad-spectrum oral  fluoroquinolone that is very active against many Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic clinical isolates, including strains resistant to other fluoroquinolones, was recently approved in Japan for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections. Sitafloxacin is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci with reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin and other quinolones and enterococci. Sitafloxacin has also demonstrated activity against clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (including about 67% of strains producing extended-spectrum, beta-lactamases and resistant to ciprofloxacin), Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa with some activity against quinolone-resistant strains and Acinetobacter baumannii. The in vitro activity against anaerobes is comparable to imipenem or metronidazole. In a published phase II randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients hospitalized with pneumonia, sitafloxacin (400 mg once daily) was comparable to imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg three times a day). Results of the phase III trials of sitafloxacin are not available in English. The clinical safety profile of sitafloxacin has been characterized from 1,059 patients who participated in 10 clinical trials. The most common events with 50 or 100 mg twice daily were gastrointestinal disorders (17.2%), mostly diarrhea, and abnormal laboratory test results (16.2%), mostly liver enzyme elevations. For Japanese patients, sitafloxacin provides the broad-spectrum coverage promised by clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin and comparable to carbapenems. While it is currently limited by its potential for phototoxicity in Caucasians, phototoxicity is essentially irrelevant if sitafloxacin is used in hospitals and especially in intensive care units.
TI  - Molecular characterisation of the metallo-beta-lactamase genes in imipenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria from a university hospital in southern Taiwan.
AB  - In this study, 260 non-replicate imipenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolated between January 2002 and December 2006 were subjected to a screening test for detection of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) using the Etest containing imipenem and ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA). Among the 260 strains, 123 (47.3%) appeared to produce MBL. Of these 123 strains, 113 (91.9%) were found by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to carry MBL genes of types blaVIM-2, blaVIM-3, blaVIM-11 (blaVIM-11a), blaIMP-8 and novel blaIMP-24. One strain of Serratia marcescens harboured two MBL genes (blaVIM-11 and blaIMP-8) simultaneously. Of the 123 strains, 116 strains (94.3%) carrying the intI1 gene and 21 strains carrying integron-associated blaVIM-3, blaVIM-11 and blaIMP-8 genes were identified among Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter haemolyticus and S. marcescens. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Southern hybridisation with the blaVIM gene probe for I-CeuI-digested genomic DNA, P. aeruginosa 9527 strain harboured two class 1 integron-associated MBL genes in the chromosome, including blaVIM-3-orf2-aacA4 and novel bla(VIM-3)-orf2-aacA4-aadB-aacA4. This is the first description of the blaVIM-11 gene spreading among P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii strains in southern Taiwan. This finding suggests that clinical spread of this blaVIM-11 gene is a matter of great concern for carbapenem resistance in southern Taiwan.
TI  - [Obtain best usage of meropenem dose in severe infections. Results of an observational multicenter study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the effectiveness and tolerability of the dose adjustment  of meropenem in empirical treatment of nosocomial infections in critically-ill patients admitted to intensive care medicine services. METHODS: Prospective, observational and multicenter study in patients admitted to 17 intensive care medicine services with nosocomial infection, who were initially treated with meropenem, 1 g every 8 h, were eligible. The initial dose was adjusted to 0.5 g every 8 h if there were: a) a favorable clinical course, and b) microbiological isolation of meropenem-susceptible pathogens or absence of pathogens in cultures. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients in whom meropenem doses were adjusted to 0.5 g every 8 h were included. Ventilator-associated pneumonia followed by bacteremia was the most frequently treated infections. Microbiological studies were positive in 53 patients, with a predominance of gram-positive bacteria (53.7%), especially methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, followed by gram-negative bacteria (42.7 %). A total of 18 patients were not evaluable at the end of treatment. Sixty-seven (90.5 %) of the 74 evaluable patients had a favorable clinical course (54 patients cured and 13 improved). In 50 out of 53 microbiologically evaluable cases, eradication or apparent eradication of initial microorganisms was achieved. In 3 cases, the initial pathogen persisted: Acinetobacter baumannii (2 cases) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 case). On three occasions, new pathogens developed during treatment: A. baumannii (2 cases) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (1 case). Adverse events occurred in 3 patients (4%), none of which was considered severe, and withdrawal of meropenem was not necessary. A total of 25 (27.2 %) patients died, three of them in relation to the infectious process. CONCLUSIONS: Dose adjustment of meropenem to 0.5 g every 8 h is a useful tool in the treatment of severe nosocomial infections in patients admitted to services of intensive care medicine except in cases in which causative pathogens are non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Clinical impact of the over-expression of efflux pump in nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli, development of efflux pump inhibitors.
AB  - In this manuscript, we want to review the biochemical and genetic characteristics of the different efflux pumps involved in both intrinsic and acquired multiresistance in non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, as well as the regulation of their expression. Moreover, the clinical impact of the over-expression of these efflux pumps and the investigation developed to define efflux pump inhibitors will be discussed. In this review it will be stated that antimicrobial resistance associated with the over-expression of MDR efflux pumps is widely recognised as a frequent multidrug resistant determinant in nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Moreover, MDR pumps contribute to the intrinsic resistance of these bacterial pathogens. Circumventing the activity of efflux pumps will thus have clear benefits for therapy, since this will increase the susceptibility of nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli, thereby increasing the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics used for treating such infections by those pathogens. In addition, it has been shown that the lack of activity of MDR pumps impedes selection of mutants showing high-level antibiotic resistance to antibiotics like quinolones or beta-lactams. Thus, besides reducing intrinsic resistance, inhibitors of efflux pumps will reduce the emergence of mutants that acquire antibiotic resistance as the consequence of mutations in MDR-regulatory elements or in other targets. Recent advances on the search for inhibitors of MDR pumps will also be finally discussed.
TI  - Infections in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in Greece.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of the patients who developed an infection in our surgical intensive care unit (SICU). METHODS: This was a prospective study of all patients who sustained an ICU-acquired infection from 2002 to 2004. RESULTS: Among 683 consecutive SICU patients, 123 (18.0%) developed 241 infections (48.3 infections per 1000 patient-days). The mean age of patients was 66.7+/-3.8 years, the mean APACHE II score (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) on SICU admission was 18.2+/-2.4, and the mean SOFA score (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) at the onset of infection was 8.8+/-2. Of the study patients, 51.2% were women. Infections were: bloodstream (36.1%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP; 25.3%, 20.3/1000 ventilator-days), surgical site (18.7%), central venous catheter (10.4%, 7.1/1000 central venous catheter-days), and urinary tract infection (9.5%, 4.6/1000 urinary catheter-days). The most frequent microorganisms found were: Acinetobacter baumannii (20.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.7%), Candida albicans (13.2%), Enterococcus faecalis (10.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), Enterococcus faecium (7.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%). High resistance to the majority of antibiotics was identified. The complication and mortality rates were 58.5% and 39.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified APACHE II score on admission (odds ratio (OR) 4.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.69-5.26, p=0.01), peritonitis (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.03-3.25, p=0.03), acute pancreatitis (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.05-3.75, p=0.02), previous aminoglycoside use (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.06-5.14, p=0.03), and mechanical ventilation (OR 3.26, 95% CI: 2.43-6.15, p=0.01) as risk factors for infection development. Age (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33, p=0.03), APACHE II score on admission (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.77-3.41, p=0.02), SOFA score at the onset of infection (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.85-4.02, p=0.02), and VAP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.85, p=0.03) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Infections are an important problem in SICUs due to high incidence, multi-drug resistance, complications, and mortality rate. In our study, APACHE II score on admission, peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, previous aminoglycoside use, and mechanical ventilation were identified as risk factors for infection development, whereas age, APACHE II score on admission, SOFA score at the onset of infection, and VAP were associated with mortality.
TI  - Impact of antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacilli on empirical and definitive antibiotic therapy.
AB  - Serious infections with gram-negative pathogens continue to be associated with considerable mortality. Increasing antibiotic resistance in organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae is contributing to difficulties with choosing antibiotics to prescribe for these infections. Optimization of therapy against these organisms starts with the initial empirical antibiotic choice. Surveillance data and hospital or unit antibiograms may inform this decision, although individualization of the initial regimen on the basis of prior antibiotic use and prior isolation of resistant pathogens may be more important. Combinations of antibiotics are often required empirically, and "combination antibiograms" may need to be developed for this purpose. Preliminary data suggest that extending the time over which a dose of antipseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotics is infused may improve clinical outcomes; however, this idea remains to be confirmed in randomized trials. The role of direct susceptibility testing in aiding more-rapid initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is also being studied. When identification and susceptibility testing is complete, the antibiotic regimen for infections due to gram-negative pathogens can be "fine tuned." On some occasions, this fine tuning necessitates the introduction of "salvage" antibiotics, such as colistin or tigecycline; on others, it necessitates de-escalation and early termination of therapy. The lack of new antibiotic options against gram-negative pathogens underscores the need for optimization of current therapies and prevention of the spread of these organisms.
TI  - Pandrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii infections: characteristics and outcome in a series of 28 patients.
AB  - We describe the characteristics and outcome of pandrug-resistant (PDR) Gram-negative bacterial infections (23 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 Acinetobacter baumannii) of hospitalised patients at a tertiary-care centre (1 January 2006-31 May 2007). The site of infection was central venous catheter-related in 5 of 24 patients with clinical infection, bacteraemia in 5, the respiratory system in 5, surgical site in 5, the urinary system in 2, the ascitic fluid in 1 and the central nervous system in one. Twenty of 24 patients with infection received an antibiotic regimen containing colistin (in combination with meropenem in 8 patients). The overall in-hospital mortality was 41.7% (10/24); 8 patients died because of the PDR infection (infection-related mortality 33.3%). Significant co-morbidity was present not only in the patients who died but also in survivors. PDR Gram-negative bacterial infections are associated with considerable mortality, although not as high as expected given the fact that the isolates were resistant to all tested antibiotics, including polymyxins. Antibiotics that are ineffective in vitro may prove life-saving for some of these patients, especially combination regimens containing colistin.
TI  - The epidemiology of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance has reached crisis point in many hospitals around the world. The majority are swamped with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and many with multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negatives. Whilst there are good treatment alternatives available for serious infections due to MRSA, mortality rates remain high. For MDR Gram-negatives the situation is more complex and worrying. There are few, if any, new agents in development that can be expected to benefit the situation in the next decade. Moreover, extreme (or extensive) drug-resistant and even pandrug-resistant Gram-negative infections are increasingly being described. Although definitions are confused in this area, reports suggest that patients in some intensive care units are dying from lack of availability of any antibiotic active against certain strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. A better understanding of the molecular basis of resistance is urgently needed if it is to be successfully overcome. Moreover, we urgently need better global early warning systems to detect new resistances and put mechanisms in place for their control.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic modeling of aminoglycosides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii: identifying dosing regimens to suppress resistance development.
AB  - To facilitate optimal dosing regimen design, we previously developed a mathematical model using time-kill study data to predict the responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to various pharmacokinetic profiles of meropenem and levofloxacin. In this study, we extended the model to predict the activities of gentamicin and amikacin exposures against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, respectively. The input data were from a time-kill study with 10(7) CFU/ml of bacteria at baseline. P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was exposed to gentamicin (0 to 16x MIC; MIC = 2 mg/liter), and A. baumannii ATCC BAA 747 was exposed to amikacin (0 to 32x MIC; MIC = 4 mg/liter) for 24 h. Using the estimates of the best-fit model parameters, bacterial responses to various fluctuating aminoglycoside exposures (half-life, 2.5 h) over 72 h were predicted via computer simulation. The computer simulations were subsequently validated using an in vitro hollow-fiber infection model with similar aminoglycoside exposures. A significant initial reduction in the bacterial burden was predicted for all gentamicin exposures examined. However, regrowth over time due to resistance emergence was predicted for regimens with a maximum concentration of the drug (C(max))/MIC (dosing frequency) of 4 (every 8 h [q8h]), 12 (q24h), and 36 (q24h). Sustained suppression of bacterial populations was forecast with a C(max)/MIC of 30 (q12h). Similarly, regrowth and suppression of A. baumannii were predicted and experimentally verified with a three-dimensional response surface. The mathematical model was reasonable in predicting extended bacterial responses to various aminoglycoside exposures qualitatively, based on limited input data. Our approach appears promising as a decision support tool for dosing regimen selection for antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Four years of monitoring of antibiotic sensitivity rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from patients in intensive care unit and inpatient clinics].
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii which are usually multiply antibiotic resistant, are the most important agents causing infections in intensive care units (ICUs). The aim of this study was to determine the antibiotic sensitivity patterns of P. aeruginosa and A.baumannii that cause infections in ICUs and hospital service units and to follow the variation in resistance between the years of 2003 to 2006. P. aeruginosa (n:1071) and A.baumannii (n:587) strains were isolated from blood, urine, wound, sterile body fluid, sputum and tracheal aspirate cultures of patients who were diagnosed to have infections in ICUs and hospital service units. Conventional methods were used for the identification of the bacteria, and antibiotic sensitivies of the isolates were investigated by disk diffusion method. The most effective antibiotics in 2003 were piperacillin-tazobactam (84%), ciprofloxacin (79%), imipenem (77.5%), and meropenem (69%) for P. aeruginosa strains isolated from ICUs. Decreasing sensitivities to imipenem (51%), meropenem (45%), cefepime (51%), piperacillin (38.5%), ciprofloxacin (72%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (44%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (67%) for P. aeruginosa were found statistically significant in 2006 (p < 0.05). The most effective antibiotics were meropenem (98%) imipenem (94%) and ampicillin/sulbactam (72%) for A.baumannii strains isolated from ICUs in 2003. Decreasing sensitivities to imipenem (60.5%), meropenem (69%), cefepime (24%), ciprofloxacin (14%), gentamicin (13%), and amikacin (19%) for A.baumannii were statistically significant in 2006 (p < 0.05). Our data have indicated that P. aeruginosa and A.baumannii strains isolated in ICUs at our hospital showed multi-drug resistance in 2006, with significant increases since 2003 against certain antimicrobial agents. In conclusion there is an urgent need for effective strategies to control the use of antibiotics in our hospital.
TI  - Nosocomial infections in a medical-surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the pattern of nosocomial infections in an adult  medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A 2-year prospective cohort study of nosocomial infection surveillance in a 15-bed adult combined medical and surgical ICU of Farwaniya Hospital, Kuwait, was carried out. Data were collected between January 2004 and December 2005 using the standard surveillance protocols and nosocomial infection site definitions of the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System's ICU surveillance component. RESULTS: Of 1,173 patients hospitalized in the ICU for an aggregate duration of 6,855 days, 89 patients acquired a total of 140 nosocomial infections; 46 (33%) ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), 33 (24%) central-line-associated bloodstream infection and 15 (11%) catheter-associated urinary tract infection, 22 (16%) cutaneous infection and 24 (17%) other infections. The overall patient day rate was 20.6/1,000 patient days. The patient infection rate was 10.6/100 patients at risk. The mean VAP rate was 9.1/1,000 ventilator days (95% CI, 5-13.2), the central-line-associated bloodstream infection rate 5.5/1,000 central line days (95% CI, 3.2-7.8) and the catheter-associated urinary tract infection rate 2.3/1,000 catheter days (95% CI, 1.2-3.4). Of all nosocomial infections, 119 (85%) were culture-confirmed and 21 (15%) were clinically defined culture-negative infections. Of the culture-confirmed nosocomial infections, 81 (68%) were Gram-negative, 32 (27%) Gram-positive and 6 (5%) fungal. The most frequent organism was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20, 17%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (15, 13%), Klebsiella spp. (13, 11%) and Escherichia coli (10, 8%). The crude mortality was 27% among ICU-infected patients. CONCLUSION: VAP was the most common nosocomial infection in our ICU. Gram-negative organisms were more commonly reported as etiologic agents of ICU infections.
TI  - Administration of antibiotics via the respiratory tract as monotherapy for pneumonia.
AB  - There is increasing interest in applying alternatives to the systemic modes of administration of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of patients with pneumonia. We endeavored to accumulate and evaluate the published evidence on the role of aerosolized antimicrobials administered as monotherapy for patients with pneumonia through searches of PubMed, Scopus and relevant bibliographies. Seven relevant studies (one randomized controlled trial, four case series and two case reports), including 63 patients, were identified; 37% (23 out of 63) and 63% (40 out of 63) of these patients suffered from community-acquired and nosocomial (including ventilator-associated) pneumonia, respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii (41%), Gram-positive cocci (37%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%) were the pathogens most frequently isolated from sputum, tracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial brush specimens. Colistin (49%), penicillin (37%) and aminoglycosides (17%) were the antimicrobials administered via the respiratory tract. Concurrent systemic antimicrobials (without activity against the isolated pathogens) were given to 33% (21 out of 63) of patients. Clinical cure and bacteriological eradication from the aforementioned specimens were observed in 86% (54 out of 63) and 85% (33 out of 39) of patients, respectively. For the 31 patients for whom data were available, all-cause mortality and attributable mortality were 36% (11 out of 31) and 10% (three out of 31), respectively. The very limited published data preclude any strong conclusions; however, the available data seem to suggest that aerosolized antimicrobial monotherapy for pneumonia should not be a priori excluded when systemic access is unavailable, denied by the patient or when concerns exist regarding bioavailability in the lungs or systemic toxicity. Clinicians are encouraged to publish any relevant experience in order for a considerable body of literature to be accumulated.
TI  - Polymyxins revisited.
AB  - The global emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli has spurred a renewed interest in polymyxins. Once discarded due to concerns regarding nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, polymyxins now hold an important role in the antibiotic armamentarium. However, more reliable information is needed to determine the optimal dosing of these agents. Also, unanswered questions regarding in vitro testing remain, including questions regarding the reliability of automated systems and the establishment of appropriate breakpoints for defining susceptibility. Most contemporary clinical studies examining the use of these agents have involved patients with infections due to multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains. It has been reassuring that polymyxin therapy for resistant bacteria has resulted in clinical responses and toxicity rates similar to those for carbapenem therapy for susceptible isolates. While most surveillance studies demonstrated high rates of susceptibility, several reports noted the emergence of polymyxin-resistant nosocomial pathogens. Polymyxins have assumed an important antibiotic niche for therapy for hospital-acquired infections; further studies defining the optimal use of these agents will likely extend the duration of their clinical usefulness.
TI  - Differential correlation between rates of antimicrobial drug consumption and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in a tertiary care hospital in Greece.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there is a correlation between the rates of antimicrobial drug consumption in hospital departments and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among clinically important bacteria recovered in the hospital. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital in Greece. METHODS: Data on antimicrobial consumption (from January 2001 through December 2004) were expressed as defined daily doses per 100 bed-days. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterococcus faecium recovered during the same time period were calculated by the microbiology department. We then performed the following analyses: (1) a comparison of the consumption rates for different antimicrobial groups in individual hospital departments, (2) a comparison of the prevalence of resistance to different antimicrobials, and (3) a correlation analysis of antimicrobial consumption rates and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: The rates of antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of resistance varied substantially among the hospital's departments. The annual rate of consumption for carbapenems correlated with the rate of consumption for glycopeptides and third-generation cephalosporins (P < .05). Among P. aeruginosa isolates, the prevalence of imipenem resistance correlated with the prevalence of resistance to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime (P < .05). The rate of carbapenem consumption correlated with the prevalence of imipenem resistance among P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates (P < .05). The rate of aminoglycoside consumption correlated with the prevalence of amikacin resistance among P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli isolates (P < .05). However, the rate of consumption for fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides had no correlation with the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance among gram-negative bacteria or vancomycin resistance among E. faecium isolates. CONCLUSIONS: These data are suggestive of a differential relationship between antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among various species and for various antimicrobial agents. These findings may help to optimize antimicrobial prescription policies in the hospital, especially in departments that have both high rates of antimicrobial consumption and a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Infections following damage control laparotomy with abdominal packing.
AB  - Our objective was to describe postoperative infections for patients undergoing damage control laparotomy (DCL) with abdominal packing. We retrospectively reviewed data on packing patients in Jinling hospital (China) during a 5-y period. Of 26 patients, 15 (57.7%) had postoperative infections. Pneumonia/lower respiratory tract infection (57.7%), bacteraemia (50%), and urinary tract infection (15.4%) were the 3 prominent types of infections. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.7%), staphylococcal species (15.6%), Acinetobacter baumannii (13.9%), and Klebsiella species (11.1%). Antibiotic resistance was common both for the Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates. No statistical correlation was demonstrated between positive packs and postoperative infection (p=0.10) or death (p=1.00). Multivariate regression analysis revealed pre-existing abdominal infection (OR=22.4, p=0.02) and increased number of surgical procedures (OR=3.69, p=0.05) to be independent risk factors for postoperative de novo infection. We conclude that patients undergoing DCL with packing carry a high incidence of postoperative infections. Causative pathogens are typical for ICU acquired infections and are often associated with low levels of susceptibility to multiple antimicrobial agents. Pre-existing abdominal infection and increased number of surgical procedures are the independent risk factors for postoperative de novo infection in these patients.
TI  - Clinically significant carbapenemases: an update.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide a brief synopsis of studies which have extended our understanding of carbapenem resistance in clinical isolates in terms of epidemiology, mechanism of action and genetic factors affecting their carriage and spread. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies published in the last 18 months continue to confirm that VIM-2 is the dominant metallo-beta-lactamase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and that it has now moved into the cystic fibrosis P. aeruginosa population. Increased incidences of KPC and Guiana extended-spectrum serine carbapenemase would indicate that these are likely to dominate in Enterobacteriaceae and that KPC-2 has now been isolated from P. aeruginosa. Class D carbapenemases still appear to be confined to Acinetobacter baumannii and, interestingly, it has been proposed that OXA-23 was transferred from the nonpathogenic Acinetobacter radioresistens. Crystal structures of KPC-2, GES-1 and OXA-24 have been reported to enhance our understanding of why these clinically important enzymes can bind and hydrolyse carbapenems, whereas others cannot. Therapeutic options continue to be limited and although tigecycline shows activity against carbapenemase-positive Enterobacteriaceae, antibiotic combinations are required for carbapenemase-positive Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa. SUMMARY: Carbapenem resistance continues to increase both in number and into new species/strain types, but our therapeutic options remain woefully inadequate - a dilemma that will not improve in the foreseeable future.
TI  - Novel polymyxin derivatives carrying only three positive charges are effective antibacterial agents.
AB  - The lack of novel antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria has reinstated polymyxins as the drugs of last resort to treat serious infections caused by extremely multiresistant gram-negative organisms. However, polymyxins are nephrotoxic, and this feature may complicate therapy or even require its discontinuation. Like that of aminoglycosides, the nephrotoxicity of polymyxins might be related to the highly cationic nature of the molecule. Colistin and polymyxin B carry five positive charges. Here we show that novel polymyxin derivatives carrying only three positive charges are effective antibacterial agents. NAB739 has a cyclic peptide portion identical to that of polymyxin B, but in the linear portion of the peptide, it carries the threonyl-D-serinyl residue (no cationic charges) instead of the diaminobutyryl-threonyl-diaminobutyryl residue (two cationic charges). The MICs of NAB739 for 17 strains of Escherichia coli were identical, or very close, to those of polymyxin B. Furthermore, NAB739 was effective against other polymyxin-susceptible strains of Enterobacteriaceae and against Acinetobacter baumannii. At subinhibitory concentrations, it dramatically sensitized A. baumannii to low concentrations of antibiotics such as rifampin, clarithromycin, vancomycin, fusidic acid, and meropenem. NAB739 methanesulfonate was a prodrug analogous to colistin methanesulfonate. NAB740 was the most active derivative against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. NAB7061 (linear portion of the peptide, threonyl-aminobutyryl) lacked direct antibacterial activity but sensitized the targets to hydrophobic antibiotics by factors up to 2,000. The affinities of the NAB compounds for isolated rat kidney brush border membrane were significantly lower than that of polymyxin B.
TI  - [Etiology, epidemiology and microbiological diagnosis of intra-abdominal infections].
AB  - Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  The etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. In community-acquired IAIs enterobacteria predominate (mostly Escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly Bacteroides fragilis). In nosocomial IAIs, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. e Candida spp. Diagnostic microbiology of IAIs is complex and plays a relevant role especially in some situations (e. g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). Antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing IAIs. Resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.
TI  - Acinetobacter baumannii: an emerging multidrug-resistant threat.
AB  - Amid the recent attention focused on the growing impact of methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, the pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii has been stealthily gaining ground as an agent of serious nosocomial and community-acquired infection. Historically, Acinetobacter spp. have been associated with opportunistic infections that were rare and of modest severity; the last two decades have seen an increase in both the incidence and seriousness of A. baumannii infection, with the main targets being patients in intensive-care units. Although this organism appears to have a predilection for the most vulnerable patients, community-acquired A. baumannii infection is an increasing cause for concern. The increase in A. baumannii infections has paralleled the alarming development of resistance it has demonstrated. The persistence of this organism in healthcare facilities, its inherent hardiness and its resistance to antibiotics results in it being a formidable emerging pathogen. This review aims to put into perspective the threat posed by this organism in hospital and community settings, describes new information that is changing our view of Acinetobacter virulence and resistance, and calls for greater understanding of how this multifaceted organism came to be a major pathogen.
TI  - First detection of the OXA-40 carbapenemase in P. aeruginosa isolates, located on a plasmid also found in A. baumannii.
AB  - The aim of this work was to carry out the molecular investigation of the OXA-40 carbapenemase detected in two isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem. The sequence showed 100% of homology with the gene previously described in Acinetobacter baumannii. Hybridization experiments located the gene on a plasmid also found in the OXA-40 control strain of A. baumannii.
TI  - beta-lactams against emerging 'superbugs': progress and pitfalls.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is an ever-growing problem. So-called 'superbugs', such as multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa harboring multiple resistance determinants, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, carbapenemases, efflux pumps and downregulated outer-membrane proteins or porins, are becoming more prevalent in hospital, intensive and long-term care settings. Enterobacteriaceae are also acquiring a myriad of beta-lactamases, such as class A and D carbapenemases, and plasmid-borne class C cephalosporinases. Gram-positive superbugs, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate or heteroglycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), are problematic pathogens, both in the hospital and in the community (e.g., community-acquired MRSA and PRSP). beta-lactam antibiotics remain among the most effective and safest anti-infectives in use, although their utility is being severely challenged by these superbugs. This review will discuss aspects of resistance seen in these pathogens and will review some of the newer beta-lactam agents, both investigational and in clinical use, that target these superbugs.
TI  - Susceptibilities of common bacterial isolates from oman to old and new antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to compare the antimicrobial activity of linezolid and tigecycline with other commonly used antibiotics against a variety of clinical isolates at Royal Hospital, Muscat. METHODS: Clinically-significant bacterial isolates in Royal hospital during the period from 1st of March to 30th of June 2007 were collected, stored and finally tested to determine their susceptibility to different antibiotics by broth microdilution (microscan panels). RESULTS: Two hundred ten bacterial strains were collected and tested including Staphylococcus aureus (29), Group B ss-haemolytic Streptococcus (10), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15), Enterococcus spp. (16), Haemophilus spp. (15), Escherichia coli (26), Klebsiella spp. (26), Enterobacter spp. (25), Serratia spp. (10), Acinetobacter baumannii (17) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21). All strains except P. aeuginosa were susceptible to tigecycline. All gram-positive strains were susceptible to linezolid. Meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed good activity against most organisms tested including P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Levofloxacin showed 100% activity against K. pneumoniae and 61% activity against E. coli. The activity of 3rd generation cephalosporins against E.coli and K.pneumoniae ranged from 76% to 100%. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline and linezolid showed excellent activity against microorganisms in their relevant spectrum of activity. However, they should be used wisely and judiciously.
TI  - Identification of an atypical integron carrying an IS26-disrupted aadA1 gene cassette in Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - An unusual class 1 integron was identified that carries an IS26-disrupted aadA1 gene cassette (designated as 'integron-IS26') in an imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (IRAB) outbreak strain. DNA sequencing revealed that integron-IS26 contained two gene cassettes, the aac(6')-Im cassette and a peculiar aadA1 cassette that was disrupted by IS26 (disrupted aadA1 cassette). Southern blotting localised integron-IS26 to the chromosome. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to define the frequency of integron-IS26 in five groups of bacteria. Nested PCR identified integron-IS26 in 19 (73.1%) of 26 clinical outbreak strains of IRAB, 10 (100%) of 10 IRAB isolated from environmental cultures, 3 (13.0%) of 23 imipenem-susceptible A. baumannii (ISAB) non-outbreak strains, 1 (3.6%) of 28 netilmicin- and tobramycin-resistant A. baumannii and none of the netilmicin- and tobramycin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In conclusion, we have identified a novel class I integron that carries the aac(6')-Im cassette and an IS26-disrupted copy of aadA1 (integron-IS26) in most IRAB outbreak strains and in a few ISAB non-outbreak control strains. Integron-IS26 is located chromosomally.
TI  - Bacterial resistance surveillance in China: a report from Mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in China. A total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15 cities throughout China. Antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The results of the MICs revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. Oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of Staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. Five strains of Enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all Enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. All Staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. A high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the Gram-positive cocci. Enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. About 65% of the Escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. Latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against Enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less than 10%. Imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of Acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant isolates. Combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. Amikacin was active against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive S. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant Gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in China. No glycopeptides-resistant Staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant Enterococci was seldom.
TI  - Re-emergence of colistin in today's world of multidrug-resistant organisms: personal perspectives.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (including Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) are being reported with increasing frequency from various parts of the world. OBJECTIVE: To share personal perspectives on the clinical use of colistin based on the available evidence reported in the literature as well as on knowledge obtained through our clinical experience with the use of colistin in a considerable number of patients during the past 7 years. METHODS: Literature review and personal experience. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: During the last decade, clinicians in several countries have resorted to colistin (polymyxin E), an antibiotic that has been shown to be clinically effective and acceptably safe for intravenous, aerosolized, and intrathecal/intraventricular administration. However, more data are needed to answer important clinical questions, including the appropriate colistin dosage, comparison of colistin monotherapy with combination therapy, and the possible preventive and therapeutic role of aerosolized colistin.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of 3931 organisms isolated from intensive care units in Canada: Canadian National Intensive Care Unit Study, 2005/2006.
AB  - We tested the in vitro activity of 15 antimicrobials against Gram-positive cocci  and 12 antimicrobials against Gram-negative bacilli versus 3931 isolates (20 most common organisms) obtained between September 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006, from 19 intensive care units (ICUs) across Canada. The most active (based upon MIC only) agents against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis were dalbavancin, daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 0.06 and < or =0.03, 0.25 and 0.12, 2 and 1, 0.5 and 0.5, and 1 and 2, respectively. The most active agents against vancomycin-resistant enterococci were daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 1, 4, and 0.12, respectively. The most active agents against Escherichia coli were amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 4, < or =1, < or =0.12, 8, and 0.5, respectively. The most active agents against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli were meropenem and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of < or =0.12 and 1, respectively. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 16, 32, 16, and 64, respectively. The most active agents against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were tigecycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 4 and 4, respectively. The most active agents against Acinetobacter baumannii were fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin), meropenem, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 0.5, 1, and 2, respectively. In conclusion, the most active agents versus Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli obtained from Canadian ICUs were daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, dalbavancin and amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline (not P. aeruginosa), respectively.
TI  - Imported PER-1 producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, PER-1 producing Acinetobacter baumanii and VIM-2-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in Hungary.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii are important nosocomial pathogens with wide intrinsic resistance. However, due to the dissemination of the acquired resistance mechanisms, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and metallo beta-lactamase (MBL) production, multidrug resistant strains have been isolated more often. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a Hungarian tourist, who was initially hospitalized in Egypt and later transferred to Hungary. On the day of admission PER-1-producing P. aeruginosa, PER-1 producing A. baumannii, SHV-5-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and VIM-2-producing P. aeruginosa isolates were subcultured from the patient's samples in Hungary. Comparing the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of the P. aeruginosa strains from the patient to the P. aeruginosa strains occurring in this hospital, we can state that the PER-1-producing P. aeruginosa and VIM-2-producing P. aeruginosa had external origin. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of PER-1-producing P. aeruginosa,and PER-1-producing A. baumanii strains in Hungary. This case highlights the importance of spreading of the beta-lactamase-mediated resistance mechanisms between countries and continents, showing the importance of careful screening and the isolation of patients arriving from a different country.
TI  - Control of bacterial biofilms with marine alkaloid derivatives.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are defined as a community of surface-attached bacteria that are protected by an extracellular matrix of biomolecules. We have recently reported the synthesis of a small molecule, denoted TAGE, based on the natural product bromoageliferin and demonstrated that TAGE has anti-biofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Herein we demonstrate that TAGE: (1) does not have selective toxicity against cells within the biofilm state, (2) will inhibit biofilm development under flow conditions, indicating that the CV staining protocol correlates with the ability to be active under biomimetic conditions, and (3) will disperse preformed P. aeruginosa biofilms. We also present preliminary toxicity work that indicates that TAGE is devoid of cytotoxicity in rat and mice cell lines. Advanced derivatives of TAGE have generated compounds shown to be exceedingly effective as biofilm inhibitors against the gamma-proteobacteria in this study (P. aeruginosa strains PAO1, PA14, PDO300, and Acinetobacter baumannii). TAGE derivatives also possessed anti-biofilm activity against the beta-proteobacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica (Rb50) and the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus;TAGE derivatives inhibited the formation of biofilms, however, some of this activity is attributed to microbicidal activity. The TAGE derivatives presented in this study, however, do not disperse pre-formed biofilms with the same efficiency as TAGE.
TI  - Matching criteria in case-control studies in the field of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the available evidence from case-control studies in the field of antimicrobial resistance to identify the degree that matching was performed and the criteria used to do so. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the PubMed database (articles archived by 08/2006) to identify relevant studies. Studies that used the individual matching technique were further analyzed. RESULTS: 115 case-control studies with a focus on antimicrobial resistance were identified: 28 regarding Acinetobacter baumannii, 25 regarding Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 62 for other bacteria. Individual matching was performed in 32 (27.8%) out of the 115 studies. Age was the most frequently used matching criterion in 22 of 32 (69%) evaluated matched case-control studies, while sex was used in 11 (34%), presence of underlying illness in 8 (25%), site of infection in 5 (16%), and area of residence in 4 studies (12.5%). Other criteria were used in less than 10% of the studies. Analysis of data for matched pairs was performed in 18 of 32 (56.3%) studies that used a matched case-control design. DISCUSSION: The available evidence from the analyzed data from case-control studies in the field of antimicrobial resistance shows that individual matching is employed only in a proportion of such studies and only for a few characteristics, when it was used. Also, analysis for matched pairs was not used by almost a half of the relevant studies.
TI  - C-3 Substituted Lawsonemonoximates of Holmium(III): Synthesis, Characterization,  and Antimicrobial Activity.
AB  - A series of five new metal complexes of Ho(III) with C-3 substituted derivatives  of lawsonemonexime (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenediene-1-oxime) were synthesized. The compounds were characterized by melting point, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds were determined by disk diffusion method and broth micro-dilution techniques using Mueller Hinton medium against the following organisms: S. aureus ATCC 6538P, Klebsiella pneumoniae, NCTC 418, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27833, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 23564, E. coli U 1777, E. coli HB101, Proteus morganii NCIM 2860, Providencia stuartii NCIM 2799 and Acinetobacter baumannii U 24. The chelates of Ho(III) with lawsonemonoxime and Ho(III) with 3-bromolawsonemonoxime showed a variable antimicrobial activity against all organisms tested except Pseudomonas and Klebsiella spp. S. aureus was found more sensitive to all ligands and chelates tested; but the MIC values of chelates were considerably less; thus having more antimicrobial effect.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of meropenem in combination with polymyxin B and gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of meropenem combined with either polymyxin B or gatifloxacin was evaluated by the checkerboard method against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 strains) and Acinetobacter baumannii (10 strains). In addition, the triple combination of polymyxin B, gatifloxacin, and meropenem was also studied as well as the polymyxin B and gatifloxacin combination. A partial synergism interaction between meropenem and polymyxin B was observed for 80% of the A. baumannii strains. In contrast, this combination showed an indifferent effect for 80% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested. The combination of meropenem and gatifloxacin showed synergism only for two strains of A. baumannii, and partial synergism and additive effect for seven strains and indifference for four strains of both species. For the strains of P. aeruginosa, the double combination of polymyxin B and gatifloxacin and the triple combination of meropenem, polymyxin B and gatifloxacin were indifferent for the majority of the strains tested, that is, 90 and 80% respectively.
TI  - [Investigation of 728 strains of infectious bacteria in burn ward and analysis of their antibiotic resistance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the infectious strains of bacteria in our burn ward in recent 5 years, and analyze their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Bacteria were isolated from the wound excretions of 306 burn patients hospitalized during 2001 to 2006 for analyzing their strains and their antibiotic resistance. RESULTS: 378 strains were Grams positive bacteria, among them Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant strain. Further analysis showed that methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ranked the first in occurrence, followed by methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and Enterococcus fecalis, 338 strains were Gram negative bacteria, and among them Acinetobacter baumannii was predominant, and Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the 2nd and 3rd. Twelve strains were fungi. CONCLUSION: Drug resistance to antibiotics in our burn ward may be related to the beta-lactamases from acinetobacter baumannii and multiple-drug-resistance of MRSA.
TI  - A convenient microbiological assay employing cell-free extracts for the rapid characterization of Gram-negative carbapenemase producers.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The dissemination of metallo and serine carbapenem-hydrolysing beta-lactamases among Gram-negative nosocomial bacteria represents an acute problem worldwide. Here, we present a rapid and sensitive assay for the characterization of carbapenemase producers to aid in infection control and prevention. METHODS: The assay involves a rapid disruption of bacterial isolates with silicon dioxide microbeads, followed by the testing in cell-free extracts of hydrolytic activity towards various beta-lactams including two carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) and a cephalosporin (ceftazidime). A parallel testing of the effects of selective beta-lactamase inhibitors such as EDTA and clavulanic acid allows differentiation of metallo carbapenemases from serine carbapenemases, and also clavulanic-acid-sensitive from -resistant enzymes among the latter. RESULTS: The efficiency of bacterial disruption using silicon dioxide microbeads was identical to that of ultrasonic treatment. The subsequent microbiological assay aimed to evaluate both substrate specificity and inhibitor profile of carbapenem-hydrolysing enzymes present in the extracts and allowed an accurate differentiation of A, B and D types, as judged by the analysis of 24 well-characterized clinical strains that included metallo-beta-lactamase producers (i.e. VIM-, IMP- and SPM-type Pseudomonas producers; an L1 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia producer; and a GOB-18 Elizabethkingia meningoseptica producer) as well as serine carbapenemase producers (i.e. an SME-type Serratia marcescens producer, a GES-2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa producer, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii KPC-2 producers and OXA-type Acinetobacter baumannii producers). CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a convenient microbiological assay aimed to more accurately and in a short time characterize carbapenem-hydrolysing enzymes produced by Gram-negative bacteria. The assay possesses broad applicability in the clinical setting.
TI  - Trends in antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative isolates from a paediatric intensive care unit in Warsaw: results from the MYSTIC programme (1997-2007).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) programme is a longitudinal global surveillance study to monitor in vitro data on microbial susceptibility in centres that prescribe meropenem. This overview provides data on the susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria (n = 1300) isolated from clinical specimens of children hospitalized in a paediatric intensive care unit (ICU) during 1997-2007. METHODS: MICs of meropenem and eight other antibiotics were determined using the CLSI agar dilution method. RESULTS: Meropenem, imipenem and ciprofloxacin were most active (>90% susceptibility) against the tested isolates. A greater proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates was susceptible to meropenem compared with imipenem. Antibiotic susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii showed an increase in 2007. Only susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime and cefepime increased. The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers among Enterobacteriaceae isolates decreased from 37% in 1997 to 21.8% in 2007, and AmpC beta-lactamase producers decreased from 24.6% to 5.7%. Consumption of cephalosporins remained the same and piperacillin/tazobactam increased 3-fold. During 11 years, despite an increase in carbapenem consumption, meropenem and imipenem have retained excellent activity against the majority of isolates studied. CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of antibiotic susceptibility of Gram-negative isolates in 1997 and 2007 showed a trend of increase, and the number of beta-lactamase-producing isolates among Enterobacteriaceae showed a trend of decrease possibly related to changes in antibiotic policy.
TI  - [Detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in gram-negative bacilli isolated in hospitals from Romania--research fellowship report].
AB  - The emergence of carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative bacilli has become a global concern since these beta-lactams are often the only effective treatment left against many multiresistant strains. Metallo-beta-lactamase-producing isolates are now widespread worldwide, and especially in Europe where they have been responsible for rather large outbreaks. Our study proposes to investigate the presence of such isolates in Romania and to characterize them at the molecular level. A total of 28 clinical isolates clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were collected between 2003 and 2007 from 5 hospitals in 3 cities in north-east of Romania (Iasi, Bacau, Galati). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed according to CLSI guidelines. MBL detection was performed using the EPI phenotypic test and PCR, that was confirmed by hydrolysis test. The structure of MBL-encoding class 1 integron was determined by PCR mapping and sequencing. Genotyping was performed by RAPD. Only 2 strains showed a positive EPI test. PCR and sequencing revealed the presence of bla(VIM-2) and bla(IMP-13) genes, in strains 16GL Pa and 247Pa, respectively. RAPD showed clonal relatedness between the Pa247 and an Italian IMP-13 producing strain. Despite the infrequent occurrence of metallo-beta-lactamases in our settings, both VIM- and IMP-types are present in Romanian Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates.
TI  - Risk factors associated with the isolation of colistin-resistant gram-negative bacteria: a matched case-control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria has led to the re-use of colistin, but resistance to this agent has already been reported. We aimed to investigate the potential risk factors for the isolation of colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from hospitalized patients. DESIGN: Matched case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital in Athens, Greece. PATIENTS: Case patients were those who had provided a clinical specimen from which a colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, or P. aeruginosa was isolated. Controls were selected from a pool of patients who had susceptible to colistin isolates and were matched (1:1) to cases for species of microorganism and site of isolation. Susceptibility to colistin was determined with the Etest. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data regarding patient demographics, comorbidities, admission to the intensive care unit, prior antibiotic use, and invasive procedures performed were analyzed as risk factors in a matched bivariable model. Variables significantly associated with colistin-resistant isolates (p < .05) were entered in a backward multivariable logistic regression model. Forty-one colistin-resistant unique patient isolates were identified from January 1, 2006, until March 31, 2007. These isolates represented infection in 35 of 41 patients. Risk factors significantly associated with the isolation of colistin-resistant isolates were age, duration of intensive care unit stay, [corrected] surgical procedures, use of colistin, use of monobactams, duration of use of colistin and duration of use of antifungal agents [corrected] In the multivariable model, use of colistin was identified as the only independent risk factor (adjusted odds ratio = 7.78, p = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa pathogens may be encountered in clinical practice, in association with inappropriate colistin use. To prevent this phenomenon, colistin should be used judiciously, given that treatment options for colistin-resistant gram-negative bacteria are limited.
TI  - Control of extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae using a computer-assisted management program to restrict third-generation cephalosporin use.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the control of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and antimicrobial resistance through a computerized antibiotic control program. METHODS: An ambidirectional intervention study was conducted at a 750-bed university hospital in Korea from February 2004 to April 2006. In November 2004, hospital-wide restriction of third-generation cephalosporin use was integrated into a pre-existing computerized antibiotic prescription program that included an approval system for 15 antimicrobials. The proportions of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and other multidrug-resistant clinical isolates were compared during three phases (9 months per phase): Phase I (pre-intervention), Phase II (intensive-intervention) and Phase III (maintenance). RESULTS: Third-generation cephalosporin use decreased significantly from 103.2 to 84.9 antibiotic use density (AUD, defined daily dose/1000 patient-days) between Phase I and Phase II (P< 0.05), whereas use of carbapenems and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors increased from 14.5 to 18.2 AUD and from 53.3 to 62.6 AUD, respectively. The proportion of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates increased significantly from 8.1% (47/578) in Phase I to 32.0% (188/587) in Phase II, and then decreased significantly to 20.6% (97/470) in Phase III (P < 0.05). In addition, the proportions of imipenem- or piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates decreased significantly over the same period (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The computerized antibiotic control program appears to be an effective tool for modifying antibiotic consumption, which may in turn prevent the spread of resistant pathogens.
TI  - [Survey on the distribution of burn pathogens and their antibiotic resistance in  burn unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of burn pathogens and their antibiotic resistance in a burn unit, so as to provide reference for clinical practice. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-eight burn patients hospitalized in our department were enrolled in this study. The pathogens isolated from the wounds, blood, venous catheter, sputum, urine, purulent discharge of wounds in these patients, and their antibiotic resistance were surveyed by retrospective analysis from Jan, 2001 to Dec, 2006. RESULTS: Total-ly 464 strains were isolated, among which Gram negative (G-) bacilli accounted for 52.6%, Gram positive microorganisms (G+) accounted for 40.5%, and fungi accounted for 6.9%. The main pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species and Escherichia coli, among which Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was predominant (93.5%). MRSA was 100% resistant to levofloxacin, penicillium, oxacillin, and it was also resistant to other antibiotics except Vancomycin. The resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Cefoperazone/Sulbactam, Imipenem and cefepime were 15.8%, 36.8%, 33.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species and Escherichia coli were predominant in the burn unit,among them Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter were more resistant to antibiotics.
TI  - [Epidemiological surveillance cultures in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria causing nosocomial infection].
AB  - Implementation of surveillance culture programs and molecular typing are important contributions of Clinical Microbiology to the control of nosocomial infections. This document provides information on collection, transport, preservation, and processing of samples for surveillance culture, as well as the criteria for interpreting and reporting the results of relevant etiologic agents in nosocomial infection. This includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus spp., enterobacteria producing extended-spectrum beta -lactamases (ESBLs), multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Details on the available methods for rapid diagnosis are also presented. The information in this document attempts to provide a general approach to the problem and may be considered a starting point for laboratories that are developing their own guidelines, according to needs defined by the multidisciplinary nosocomial infection control team.
TI  - Emerging gram-negative antibiotic resistance: daunting challenges, declining sensitivities, and dire consequences.
AB  - Emerging antibiotic resistance has created a major public health dilemma, compounded by a dearth of new antibiotic options. Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms have received less attention than Gram-positive threats, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but are just as menacing. Pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii employ a variety of resistance mechanisms and are associated with dangerous nosocomial outbreaks. In some cases these pathogens have expressed resistance to all clinically available compounds. The emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in the community has raised alarm. Furthermore, the carbapenems, currently the most successful class of antibiotics, are showing signs of vulnerability. While the search for new antibiotic options continues, there is urgent need to employ strategies that will slow the development of resistance to the current armamentarium, such as avoiding prolonged antibiotic use or under-dosing, using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles to choose dosing regimens, and encouraging early and aggressive empirical therapy, followed by de-escalation and narrowing the antimicrobial spectrum when culture results become available.
TI  - Colistin and polymyxin B in critical care.
AB  - The emergence of gram-negative bacteria resistant to most available antibiotics has led to the readministration of polymyxins B and E (colistin) as "salvage" therapy in critically ill patients. Recent studies demonstrated acceptable effectiveness and considerably less toxicity than reported in older studies of polymyxins. These old antibiotics may be administered for the treatment of intensive care unit-acquired infections of various types, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bacteremia, and meningitis caused by multidrug resistant gram-negative pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter species. Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to further clarify various issues regarding the effectiveness and safety of polymyxins, however.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates from respiratory care wards in Taiwan: a horizontal surveillance study.
AB  - A horizontal surveillance study was conducted to identify common bacteria and mycobacteria from 611 respiratory aspirates and 165 urinary samples from 611 patients hospitalised at 17 respiratory care wards (RCWs) in Taiwan. Some major resistance phenotypes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB), were identified. Pulsotypes of ESBL-producing P. mirabilis isolates were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The prevalences of MRSA, ESBL-producing E. coli (K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis), carbapenem-resistant (resistant to imipenem and meropenem) P. aeruginosa, MDR-PA, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and MDR-AB were, respectively, 86.7%, 20.0% (50.7% and 24.1%), 18.4%, 1.2%, 32.1% and 8.9% for respiratory aspirates and 100%, 25.4% (27.3% and 25.0%), 48.3%, 10.3%, 50.0% and 21.4% for catheterised urinary samples. Among the 44 respiratory isolates of P. mirabilis with an ESBL phenotype, 22 different pulsotypes (>80% identity) were identified. Among 103 isolates of mycobacteria, 90 (87.4%) belonged to rapidly growing mycobacteria and 4 (4%) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among the 404 patients with available clinical information, true infections were found in 28.0%, the most prevalent of which were urinary tract infection (20.5%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10.9%). High prevalences of various multidrug-resistant bacteria among the respiratory and urinary tracts of patients present a clinical difficulty in choosing empirical antibiotic treatment in RCWs.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant organisms in military wounds from Iraq and Afghanistan.
AB  - Mortality from battlefield wounds has historically declined, thanks to better surgical management, faster transport of casualties, and improved antibiotics. Today, one of the major challenges facing U.S. military caregivers is the presence of multidrug-resistant organisms in orthopaedic extremity wounds. The most frequently identified resistant strains of bacteria are Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex. Overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics may be an important factor in building resistant strains. Acinetobacter infections appear to hospital-acquired and not from an initial colonization of the injury. More research is required to give military physicians the tools they require to reduce the infection rate and defeat multidrug-resistant organisms.
TI  - Colistin serum concentrations after intravenous administration in critically ill  patients with serious multidrug-resistant, gram-negative bacilli infections: a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, has led to the revival of the systemic use of antimicrobial agent colistin in critically ill patients, but only limited data are available to define its pharmacokinetic profile in these patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess steady-state serum concentrations of colistin after i.v. administration of colistin methanesulfonate (CMS) in critically ill patients with stable kidney function. METHODS: This prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study was conducted at 2 intensive care units in the Athens Trauma Hospital, KAT, Athens, Greece. Adult patients were nonconsecutively enrolled if they were critically ill and had stable kidney function (<0.5 mg/dL change in serum creatinine prior to and until the day of sample collection) and had been receiving CMS as part of a treatment regimen for sepsis irrespective of site of infection with multidrug-resistant, gram-negative bacilli. After i.v. administration of 225-mg CMS (with the exception of 1 patient who received 150 mg) every 8 or 12 hours for at least 2 days, blood samples were collected just before and at 10 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after i.v. infusion (duration, 30 minutes) of the colistin dose on the sampling day. RESULTS: Fourteen nonconsecutive patients were enrolled in the study (13 male, 1 female; mean [SD] age, 62.0 [19.2] years; mean [SD] estimated weight, 72.5 [8.5] kg; mean [SD] Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II score on admission, 17.1 [6.0]). At steady state, mean (SD) colistin maximum and minimum concentrations were 2.93 (1.24) and 1.03 (0.44) mg/L, respectively, while mean (SD) apparent total body clearance, apparent volume of distribution, and t(1/2) were 13.6 (5.8) L/h, 139.9 (60.3) L, and 7.4 (1.7) hours, respectively. Colistin-related nephrotoxicity was not observed in the study patients. CONCLUSION: CMS dosage regimens administered to these critically ill adult patients were associated with suboptimal Cmax/MIC ratios for many strains of gram-negative bacilli currently reported as sensitive (MIC, < or = 2 microg/mL).
TI  - Colistin susceptibility testing by Etest and disk diffusion methods.
AB  - The accuracy of disk susceptibility methods for colistin against 778 bacterial pathogens was evaluated in comparison with Etest using interpretive criteria available from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Colistin exhibited excellent activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli isolates (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90))=0.5 mg/L), whilst it was less active both against Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC for 50% of the organisms (MIC(50))=0.5 mg/L, MIC(90)=16 mg/L). Colistin also showed good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(90)=2 mg/L, MIC(50)=1 mg/L) but poor activity against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC(50)=8 mg/L, MIC(90)=128 mg/L). Only 0.8% of minor errors were observed between the studied methods for P. aeruginosa isolates when the CLSI criteria were applied. All A. baumannii isolates with a zone diameter < or =12 mm were resistant and those with a zone diameter > or =14 mm were susceptible according to MIC breakpoints established by the CLSI. Among nine isolates exhibiting a zone diameter of 13 mm, one was resistant to colistin (MIC=8 mg/L) and eight isolates were susceptible (MIC=0.5 mg/L). Applying a MIC breakpoint of < or =2 mg/L for susceptibility in Enterobacteriaceae, all isolates with a zone diameter > or =14 mm were susceptible, whilst all isolates with a zone diameter < or =11 mm were resistant. Among isolates with zone diameters of 12-13 mm, 59% were characterised as susceptible. Major errors were observed only in K. pneumoniae isolates at a rate of 0.8%. The poor agar diffusion characteristics of colistin limit the predictive accuracy of the disk diffusion test and consequently values of 12-13 mm should be confirmed with MIC determination by Etest or broth dilution method.
TI  - Outcomes of bacteremia in burn patients involved in combat operations overseas.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burn patients constitute approximately 5% of casualties injured in support of US military operations in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom [OIF]) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom [OEF]). Since the onset of these conflicts, there have been numerous casualties infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria. It is currently unclear if bacteremia with these multidrug-resistant organisms in OIF/OEF burn casualties is associated with increased mortality. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to the US Army Institute of Surgical Research burn center from January 2003 to May 2006 to evaluate bacteremia in our burn-patient population. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine of 1,258 patients admitted to the burn center became bacteremic during their hospitalization. Of these, 92 had bacteremia with the top four pathogens in our burn center, ie, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex, and Staphylococcus aureus. Presence of any bacteremia was associated with mortality and increased ventilator days. Bacteremia with K pneumoniae was associated with a statistically increased mortality and a prolonged ventilator course relative to all other pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Casualties of OIF/OEF with burn injuries did not have different outcomes than patients whose burns were not associated with military operations. Bacteremia, especially with a multidrug-resistant organism, causes increased mortality in burn patients. Of all the pathogens causing bacteremia, K pneumonia appears to have the greatest impact on mortality.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of PER-1 extended spectrum beta-lactamase among gram-negative bacteria isolated at a tertiary care hospital.
AB  - The bla(PER-1) presence was sought by PCR in 289 ceftazidime resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolated at Dokuz Eylul University Hospital (Turkey) between 1998 and 2003. PER-1 production rates were 32.3, 33.9, 14.9 and 37.9% in the 1998-2000 period, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. bla(PER-1) was detected in 46.2 and 35.9% of ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. ERIC-PCR results revealed that dissemination of two endemic clones for both P. aeruginosa (X and Y) and A. baumannii (A and B) was responsible for the high prevalence. Results of the conjugation tests and plasmid curing experiments suggested that bla(PER-1) was located on the chromosome in the representative strains. It was also shown for the first time that bla(PER-1) in a clinical isolate was associated with class-1 integron which could facilitate dissemination of bla(PER-1) among bacteria.
TI  - Melatonin as an antibiotic: new insights into the actions of this ubiquitous molecule.
AB  - The incidence of serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria has been increasing rapidly worldwide despite advances in antibacterial therapy in the last two decades. Among multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are of great importance, because they have emerged as primary nosocomial pathogens in hospital outbreaks. In this study, we investigated whether melatonin has antibacterial effects against these microorganisms in vitro. The minimum inhibitory concentration of melatonin was determined using a standard microdilution method at 24 and 48 hr. Melatonin inhibited microbial growth at both 24 and 48 hr; but results showed that melatonin had antibacterial effects against these microorganisms after 48 hr of incubation in lower doses [concentrations between 31.25 to 125 microg/mL (0.13-0.53 mM)]. Also, it was determined that melatonin has a more potent antimicrobial effect on gram-negative microorganism. Among possible mechanisms, it is concluded that melatonin showed antibacterial effects by reducing intracellular substrates.
TI  - Antimicrobial breakpoints for gram-negative aerobic bacteria based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models with Monte Carlo simulation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study describes a comprehensive programme designed to develop pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) breakpoints for numerous antimicrobial classes against key gram-negative aerobic bacteria. METHODS: A 10,000 subject Monte Carlo simulation was constructed for 13 antimicrobials (21 dosing regimens). Published pharmacokinetic data and protein binding were varied according to log-normal and uniform distributions. MICs were fixed at single values from 0.03 to 64 mg/L. The PK-PD susceptible breakpoint was defined as the MIC at which the probability of target attainment was > or = 90%. PK-PD, CLSI and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing breakpoints were applied to MICs from the 2005 worldwide Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection database to evaluate the impact of breakpoint discrepancies. RESULTS: PK-PD breakpoints were within one dilution of the CLSI and European breakpoints for all antimicrobials tested--with a few exceptions. When discrepancies were noted, the PK-PD breakpoint was lower than the CLSI breakpoint [ceftriaxone (0.5 versus 8 mg/L), ertapenem (0.25 versus 2 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (0.125 versus 1 mg/L) and levofloxacin (0.25-0.5 versus 2 mg/L)] and higher than the European breakpoint [ceftazidime (4-8 versus 1 mg/L), aztreonam (4-8 versus 1 mg/L), although ciprofloxacin was an exception to this pattern (0.125 versus 0.5-1 mg/L)]. For Enterobacteriaceae, breakpoint discrepancies resulted in modest (< or = 10%) differences in the percentages susceptible. In contrast, large (> 15%) discrepancies were noted for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSIONS: Breakpoint agreement exists for imipenem, meropenem and the aminoglycosides. In contrast, discrepancies exist for piperacillin/tazobactam, cephalosporins, ertapenem, aztreonam and the fluoroquinolones. These discrepancies are most pronounced for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.
TI  - What is in the pipeline for Gram-negative pathogens?
AB  - The emergence of new human pathogens and increasing antimicrobial resistance in well-established pathogens are critical public health concerns. Unfortunately, the pipeline of new antimicrobial candidates remains remarkably lean for molecules active against increasingly problematic Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although a number of new anti-Gram-negative antibacterial agents are likely to be introduced soon for clinical use, they will not represent a quantum leap in our ability to effectively treat these human pathogens of great concern. New classes of antimicrobials with novel mechanisms of action and new approaches to increasing the effectiveness of traditional antimicrobials are urgently needed. Renewed research and development efforts must become a priority, lest we fall further behind in our therapeutic initiatives.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from Turkey--a report from the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program.
AB  - The study monitored the susceptibility of nosocomial pathogens to meropenem and comparator antimicrobial agents isolated as part of the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program from Turkish university hospitals. In terms of minimum inhibitory concentration 90% (MIC(90)) values, meropenem was two- and eight-fold more active than imipenem against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. 40.5% of K. pneumoniae, 23.1% of Klebsiella oxytoca and 15.3% of E. coli isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active agent against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by meropenem and imipenem. Against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, meropenem and imipenem were the most active agents. Continued surveillance by the MYSTIC Program appears to be prudent to help focus on effective empiric treatment regimens.
TI  - Microbiological surveillance of the surgical intensive care unit in Zagreb--a pivot for guideline-based therapy of severe sepsis.
AB  - The aim of this retrospective study was to create guidelines for therapy of severe sepsis in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) for unknown causative agent based on antimicrobial susceptibility of causative bacteria. Seventy-four patients with severe sepsis from surgical ICU in 2003.-2005. were included in study. Their clinical and microbiological data were analyzed from the medical records. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains isolated from the blood-culture was tested by disk diffusion method according to CLSI (Clinical Laboratory Standard Institution). APACHE II score was used to predict the severity of illness. Statistical significance difference between results was tested by Mann-Whitney test and chi2 test. Important problem remained type of sepsis: mono-agent sepsis presented less therapeutic problem than sepsis caused with two or more agents (mixed sepsis). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were predominant causative agents in both type of sepsis. There was remarkable increase of A. baumannii prevalence in 2005 compared to 2004 and to 2003. There was also decrease of MRSA prevalence in 2004 and 2005 compared to 2003. P. aeruginosa were the predominant causative agents in 2004. MRSA displayed good susceptibility to vancomycin and linezolide, whereas P. aeruginosa showed excellent susceptibility to ceftazidime and carbapenems. A. baumannii, third predominant causative agent, exhibited excellent susceptibility to ampicillin+ sulbactam and carbapenems. The recommended therapy is empirical and should cover all important pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacteria to fosfomycin.
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against a randomly selected sample of 30 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 30 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 30 Acinetobacter baumannii multidrug-resistant, clinical isolates from patients in a general tertiary care hospital in Athens, Greece. Standard laboratory methods were used for susceptibility testing to commonly used antibiotics and the detection of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) production. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fosfomycin for each isolate was determined by the agar dilution method. All K. pneumoniae isolates were both ESBL and MBL producers; all P. aeruginosa isolates were ESBL producers. The K. pneumoniae strains had fosfomycin MICs distributed across a range of 8-64 microg/ml; MIC(50) was 16 microg/ml and MIC(90) 32 microg/ml. The fosfomycin MICs of the P. aeruginosa strains had a distribution across a range of 4 to over 512 microg/ml; MIC(50) was 32 microg/ml and MIC(90) 128 microg/ml. The fosfomycin MICs of the A. baumannii strains had a distribution across a range of 64 to over 512 microg/ml; MIC(50) was 256 microg/ml and MIC(90) more than 512 microg/ml. Although standardized fosfomycin MIC interpretative breakpoints for the species studied are lacking, the findings of our study support the idea that fosfomycin may be further investigated as one among a decreasing list of therapeutic options for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant strains of, primarily, K. pneumoniae and, secondly, P. aeruginosa.
TI  - The Maxwell Finland Lecture: for the duration-rational antibiotic administration  in an era of antimicrobial resistance and clostridium difficile.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is frequently associated with clinical use of antibiotics. This close association suggests that efforts to manage our use of these potent agents can have an impact on the prevalence of resistance. Unfortunately, one size does not fit all when considering the response of bacterial pathogens to antimicrobial exposure. Measures that may prevent resistance in some species (such as using multiple antibiotics to treat tuberculosis) may exacerbate the problem of resistance in others (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii). The simplest approach is to use fewer antibiotics and thereby apply less selective pressure to the prevalent flora. Among available strategies to reduce use, reductions in length of antimicrobial regimens are the safest and are likely to be the most palatable to practicing clinicians. Studies are urgently needed to define minimal lengths of therapy to ensure that efforts at reduced use are safe and effective.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among nosocomial gram-negative pathogens from 15 teaching hospitals in China in 2005].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance among the nosocomial gram-negative pathogens from 15 teaching hospitals located in different areas in China in 2005. METHODS: A total of 1927 non-repetitive nosocomial gram-negative pathogens were collected from 15 teaching hospitals in different areas in China and sent to the central lab for reidentification and susceptibility testing. The levels of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 18 antimicrobial agents were determined by agar dilution method. WHONET 5.4 software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteous mirabilis isolates that did not produce extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs) showed high sensitivity to beta-lactams. The antibiotics with a susceptibility rates over 80% against the strains of Entorobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogene, Citrobacter spp, Serratia spp, and Proteous vulgaris producing AmpC enzyme included meropenem, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam, and these 3 drugs showed a susceptibility rate of more than 80% against the ESBL-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Other antimicrobial agents showing a relatively high activity against Enterobacter spp, Citrobacter spp, Serratia spp and Proteous vulgaris included cefepime (67.3% - 100%), amikacin (67.3% - 95.2%), ceftazidime (52.9% - 100%) and cefoperazone-sulbactam (51.9% - 100%). The susceptibility rate of fluoroquinolones was 34.8% - 36.1% against non-ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and was 13.4% - 17.1% against ESBL-producing isolates. The most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was polymyxin B (95.6%). The agents with the activity rates of 70% - 80% included meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. The antibiotic with a high susceptible rate against Acinetobacter baumannii was polymyxin B (98.3%), followed by imipenem (80.8%), meropenem (76.2%), and minocycline (67.4%). The susceptible rates of other agents were all below 60%. The agents with relatively high activity against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia included minocycline (85%), levofloxacin (82.5%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (77.5%). The agents with a relatively high activity against Burkholderia cepacia included minocycline (77.2%) and meropenem (61.4%). CONCLUSION: Carbapenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin and cefepime remained relatively high activity against nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae, Non-fermenting pathogens have lower susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents than before.
TI  - [Prevalence of Class A Extended-Spectrum beta-Lactamases in Clinical Isolates of  Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevalence of class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) has been investigated repeatedly in members of family Enterobacteriaceae in Korea, but only rarely in Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of class A ESBL-producing A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa and to characterize the genotypes. METHODS: During the period of June to September 2004, clinical isolates of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were collected from patients in Kosin University Gospel Hospital, Busan, Korea. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disk diffusion and the agar dilution methods, and ESBLproduction by the double-disk synergy test. Transferability of ceftazidime-resistance of ESBL-producers were tested by conjugation. The isoelectric points of ESBLs were determined by isoelectric focusing. Searches for bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(PER-1), bla(VEB), and bla(GES/IBC) genes were performed by PCR amplification, and the genotypes of ESBLs were determined by a direct nucleotide sequence analysis of the amplified products. RESULTS: A total of 58 clinical isolates of A. baumannii and 77 P. aeruginosa were collected. Three (5.2%) isolates of A. baumannii and four (5.2%) P. aeruginosa isolates showed positive results in the double-disk synergy test using ceftazidime and imipenem disks, and one (1.7%) A. baumannii and two (2.6%) P. aeruginosa isolates showed positive results in that test using ceftazidime and cefoxitin disks. The most prevalent class A ESBL genotype in A. baumannii isolates was bla(PER-1) (n=6), and bla(SHV-12) gene was also found in one P. aeruginosa isolate. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that class A PER-1 ESBL-producing A. baumannii isolates are spreading, and SHV-12-producing P. aeruginosa has emerged in Korea. The spread of class A ESBLs could compromise the future usefulness of expanded-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics for the treatment of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections.
TI  - A class IIa peptide from Enterococcus mundtii inhibits bacteria associated with otitis media.
AB  - Peptide ST4SA, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4SA, inhibits the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients diagnosed with middle ear infections. The peptide adsorbed at a level of 94% to S. pneumoniae 40, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25 and E. faecium HKLHS. Low concentrations of peptide ST4SA (51200 arbitrary units (AU)/mL) caused DNA and enzyme leakage from target cells, whilst 1638400AU/mL caused cell lysis. No decrease in antimicrobial activity was observed when tested on solid medium with human blood as base. Peptide ST4SA revealed a similar level of activity compared with tetracycline (30 microg), but much higher activity compared with nasal sprays, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, nitroimidazole, penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, fusidic acid, rifampicin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin when tested in vitro. Peptide ST4SA dissipates the proton-motive force and may be used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains where antibiotics are excluded from cells by efflux pumps dependent on the membrane proton gradient.
TI  - Genetic support of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - Genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have been reported in a  variety of Gram-negative species, mostly in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. They are mostly either TEM or SHV derivatives, CTX-M-like enzymes--now emerging worldwide--or, less frequently, VEB, GES, and PER ESBLs. The mechanisms responsible for their acquisition are very diverse, and mostly are related to insertion sequences (ISs), transposons, class 1 integrons, and also sul1-type integrons containing the ISCR1 element. This diversity of genetic vehicles at the origin of these mobilisation/acquisition processes enhances the spread of ESBLs.
TI  - [Microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. Analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. METHODS: The species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the Severance Hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. Blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. Identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. Among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. Escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Enterococcus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The proportion of patients with Enterococcus faecium and K. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. Enterococcus, S. aureus and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. E. coli, Enterococcus spp., K. pneumoniae and S. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. Oxacillin-resistant S. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenemresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii increased. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and S. aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, and K. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. The bacteremia due to Enterococcus, K. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii gradually increased during this period.
TI  - In vitro activity of isepamicin and other aminoglycosides against clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial bloodstream infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Isepamicin is a newly introduced aminoglycoside in Taiwan. Since in vitro data for isepamicin against nosocomial Gram-negative bloodstream infection from Taiwan are limited, we compared the activity of isepamicin, amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin against nosocomial Gram-negative blood isolates. METHODS: A total of 247 non-duplicate nosocomial blood isolates of Gram-negative bacteria collected between January 2003 and December 2003 in a major teaching hospital in Taiwan were tested for their in vitro susceptibilities to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and isepamicin using the agar dilution method. The isolates included Escherichia coli (31 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (31), Enterobacter cloacae (30), Serratia marcescens (31), Morganella morganii (21), Citrobacter freundii (10), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31), Acinetobacter baumannii (31), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31). RESULTS: Overall, isepamicin had high antibacterial activity against the tested Gram-negative bacteria. For the 154 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, isepamicin had the lowest minimum concentration inhibiting 90% of isolates (MIC90) among the tested drugs, while its resistance rate (3.9%) was equal to that of amikacin (3.9%) and lower than those of tobramycin (18.2%) and gentamicin (21.4%). For the 93 of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli isolates, isepamicin had the lowest MIC90, and a resistance rate (23.7%) lower than those of amikacin (27.9%), tobramycin (38.7%) and gentamicin (40.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro activity of isepamicin against Gram-negative bacteria isolates was equal or similar to amikacin and superior to other tested aminoglycosides. In view of its potential for less nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity than other aminoglycosides, isepamicin is a drug of choice for the empirical treatment of nosocomial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of copper and copper alloys against nosocomial pathogens and Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from healthcare facilities in the Western Cape: an in-vitro study.
AB  - Clinical isolates of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Candida albicans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) were tested against copper (Cu) and its alloys. Stainless steel and polyvinylchloride (PVC) were used as controls. The amount of Cu required to inhibit test isolates at room temperature (24 degrees C) and at 4 degrees C was determined. At room temperature, Cu, DZR Brass (Cu 62%, Pb 2.5%, arsenate 0.13% and Zn 22.5%) and Brass 70/30 (Cu 70% and zinc 30%) inhibited C. albicans and K. pneumoniae at 60 min; nickel silver (NiAg) inhibited C. albicans at 60 min and K. pneumoniae at 270 min. P. aeruginosa was inhibited by Brass 70/30 and nickel silver (NiAg) at 180 min and at 270 min by Cu and DZR. Cu and DZR inhibited A. baumannii at 180 min while the other alloys were effective at 360 min. Stainless steel and PVC showed little or no inhibitory activity. Two M. tuberculosis strains, one isoniazid resistant (R267) and the other multidrug resistant (R432), demonstrated growth inhibition with Cu of 98% and 88% respectively compared with PVC; the other alloys were less active. Time to positivity (TTP) for R267 was >15 days with Cu and 11 days for the other alloys; with R432 it was 5 days. Effective inhibition of nosocomial pathogens and MTB by Cu and alloys was best when the Cu content was >55%.
TI  - [Epidemiology and susceptibility profile of blood culture isolates in an intensive care unit (2002-2005)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determine the epidemiological profile and the antibiotics susceptibility of bacteria identified in blood culture in the intensive care unit, to improve empirical antibiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective study was made over a four-year period (2002-2005) in the intensive care unit of the Mohammed-V Military Hospital. It included all the bacteria identified in blood culture. RESULTS: During this period, we collected 286 isolates, Gram-negative bacilli 49.3% and Gram-positive cocci 46.85%. The most frequently identified species were Acinetobacter baumannii (13.63%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.9%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Enterobacteriaceae accounted for 25.54%: Klebsiella pneumoniae 7%, and Enterobacter cloacae 7%. The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 52.94 % and coagulase negative staphylococci 60.24%. No resistance to glycopeptides was observed. Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to third generation cephalosporins in 42.6 % and had a broad-spectrum betalactamase phenotype in 18%. The resistance rate of A. baumannii was 68.7% for ceftazidime and 31.4% for imipenem. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to the third generation cephalosporines and the imipenem were respectively 16.6% and 10.5%. CONCLUSION: A regular epidemiologic study of blood culture isolates and determination of susceptibility to antibiotics are necessary to improve empiric therapy.
TI  - [Mutations in gyrA and gyrB genes among strains of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from Chilean hospitals and their relation with resistance to fluoroquinolones].
AB  - BACKGROUND: A progressive frequency of resistance to fluoroquinolones is observed among Gram-negative bacilli. AIM: To investigate the mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones mediated by mutations affecting gyrA and gyrB genes in strains of Gram negative baculi isolated from CMean hospitals. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Minimal inhibitory concentration of fluoroquinolones was determined in 91 randomly selected nalidixic acid-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolated from hospitals of 12 Chilean cities. Quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) was amplified by PCR and mutations were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Strains with mutation in codon 83 of gyrA showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin with MICs ranging from 0.25 to 1024 fig/ml. The sequencing of PCR products for gyrA indicated amino acid changes in the QRDR region. One strain ofE. coli presented a double mutation, in codon 83 Ser to Leu as well as in codon 87 Asp to Asn. In strains ofK. pneumoniae, however, the change of codon 83 was Ser to Tyr, in A. baumannii was Ser to Leu and in P. aeruginosa was Thr to He. No strains with mutations affecting gyrB were found. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in codon 83 of gyrA is a frequent genetic event involved in the mechanism leading to decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolone in strains of Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Aerosolized colistin as adjunctive treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria: a prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains the leading cause of death in patients with intensive care unit (ICU) acquired infections associated with an attributable mortality around 30%. Increasing antimicrobial resistance in patients with VAP challenges intensivists to search for alternative therapeutic options. There is scarcity of data in the literature concerning the administration of aerosolized colistin in critically ill patients with VAP due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens. METHODS: To assess the safety and effectiveness of aerosolized colistin as an adjunctive to the intravenous antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of VAP due to MDR Gram-negative pathogens, we prospectively examined all patients, who received inhaled colistin. RESULTS: Sixty critically ill patients with a mean APACHE II score 16.7, received aerosolized colistin for the treatment of VAP due to MDR pathogens [Acinetobacter baumannii (37/60 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12/60 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (11/60 cases)]. Half of the isolated pathogens were susceptible only to colistin. Mean (+/-SD) daily dosage of aerosolized colistin was 2.2 (+/-0.7) million international units (IU). All patients received 2946 inhalations of colistin and the mean duration of administration was 16.4 days. Fifty-seven patients received concomitant intravenous treatment with colistin or other antimicrobial agents. Bacteriological and clinical response of VAP was observed in 50/60 (83.3%) patients. No adverse effects related to inhaled colistin were recorded. All cause hospital mortality was 25% while mortality attributable to VAP was 16.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosolized colistin may be considered as adjunctive to intravenous treatment in patients with VAP due to MDR Gram-negative bacteria susceptible to colistin in critically ill patients. Although colistin is safe and effective, the best route of administration remains unclear. In addition, controlled comparative studies are needed to establish its effectiveness and safety.
TI  - [Resistance epidemiology of gramnegative nonfermenting pathogens of nosocomial infections in intensive care units and surgical departments].
AB  - Etiological structure, patterns and antibiotic resistance mechanisms of gramnegative nonfermenting pathogens of nosocomial infections isolated from patients in intensive care units and surgical departments were investigated. One hundred thirty one clinical isolates, including 86 (65.6%) isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 45 (34.4%) isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii were tested. Carbapenems and cefoperazone/sulbactam showed the highest activity against the tested isolates. Eleven carbapenem resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were detected. The strains were found to possess genetic determinants of the VIM group encoding metal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Five-year review of infections in a burn intensive care unit: High incidence of Acinetobacter baumannii in a tropical climate.
AB  - A 5-year review of nosocomial infections, bacteraemia and wound colonization in patients admitted to a burn intensive care unit from June 2001 to May 2006 was carried out. All patients required intubation at some point, and ICU support. Data on bacterial and fungal isolates were entered prospectively into a hospital-wide computerized database. Nosocomial infections (NIs) were defined using standard CDC criteria. Seventy-six patients were admitted during the study period, with 57 qualifying for analysis. Forty-two patients (74%) developed 137 NIs, with 240 NIs/100 admissions. The most common NI was pneumonia (43%), followed by burn wound infection (34%), primary bloodstream infection (20%) and urinary tract infection (3%). The device specific rate of pneumonia was 143 infections per 1000 ventilator days. There were 113 episodes of bacteraemia and 173 episodes of wound colonization without infection. The most common organisms causing nosocomial infections were Acinetobacter sp. (n=33), followed by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n=24) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=22). A. baumannii isolates were highly multiresistant, with 82 distinct strains isolated from 47 patients (82% of patients). Data from this and other studies supports the hypothesis that A. baumannii is more common in tropical, warm climes necessitating vigorous infection control measures to optimise patient outcome.
TI  - [Intravenous colistin in the treatment of infections due to pan-resistant Gram negative bacilli].
AB  - Emergence of panresistant gram negative bacilli has lead to the progressive reintroduction of intravenous colistin. AIM: To describe the clinical experience observed with this compound. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective analysis was performed for all treatments lasting >/= 48 hours. Medical records were analyzed to obtain clinical parameters and microbiological data, evaluate clinical response and evolution until discharge. MAIN RESULTS: 24 treatments lasting >/= 48 hours were applied between June 2005 and September 2006. Intravenous colistin was indicated to treat cases of ventilator-associated (VA) pneumonia (n = 10; 41.7%), abscess or collections (12.5%), bloodstream infections, non-VA pneumonia or urinary tract infections (4.2% each one, respectively). Treatment was initiated on average at 3.2 days (+/- 2.85) from diagnosis of infection. All courses were microbiologically-guided, and involved P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii isolates. Susceptibility was evaluated by E-test in 11 isolates (MIC90 3.6 nicrog/mL, range 0.38 to 4 microg/mL). One isolate was resistant to colistin (9%). A favorable response was observed in 12 treatments (50%) with a relapse in 5 cases (41.7%). Being treated for pneumonia was the only factor associated to failure, (p = 0.04) Eradication was documented in 8 cases (33.3%) and persistence in 11 (45.8%). In 5 cases a microbiological follow-up was not available. Survival at time of discharge was 45.5%. (n = 10) None of the treatment courses was associated with nefrotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous colistin is a safe compound useful to treat various nosocomial infections due to pan-resistant gram negative bacilli. Nonetheless, its clinical efficacy is limited, especially among patients treated for nosocomial pneumonia.
TI  - Activity of meropenem with and without ciprofloxacin and colistin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Time-kill synergy studies showed that at 24 h, subinhibitory meropenem and ciprofloxacin concentrations of 0.06 to 128 and 0.03 to 32 microg/ml, respectively, showed synergy against 34/51 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains; subinhibitory concentrations of meropenem (0.06 to 8 microg/ml) and colistin (0.12 to 1 microg/ml) showed synergy against 13 isolates. Subinhibitory meropenem and ciprofloxacin concentrations of 0.25 to 2 and 0.12 to 16 microg/ml, respectively, showed synergy against 18/52 Acinetobacter baumannii strains at 24 h. Subinhibitory meropenem and colistin concentrations of 0.03 to 64 and 0.06 to 8 microg/ml, respectively, showed synergy against 49 strains at 24 h.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Comparative analysis of the bactericidal activities of amphibian peptide analogues against multidrug-resistant nosocomial bacterial strains.
AB  - Due to the widespread resistance of bacteria to the available drugs, the discovery of new classes of antibiotics is urgently needed, and naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered promising candidates for future therapeutic use. Amphibian skin is one of the richest sources of such AMPs. In the present study we compared the in vitro bactericidal activities of five AMPs from three different species of anurans against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates belonging to species often involved in nosocomial infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii). The peptides tested were temporins A, B, and G from Rana temporaria; the fragment from positions 1 to 18 of esculentin 1b [Esc(1-18)] from Rana esculenta; and bombinin H2 from Bombina variegata. When they were tested in buffer, all the peptides were bactericidal against all bacterial species tested (three strains of each species) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 48 microM, with only a few exceptions. The temporins were found to be more active against gram-positive bacteria, especially when they were assayed in human serum; Esc(1-18) showed fast and strong bactericidal activity, within 2 to 20 min, especially against the gram-negative species, which were killed by Esc(1-18) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1 microM; bombinin H2 displayed similar bactericidal activity toward all isolates. Interestingly, while the activities of the temporins and bombinin H2 were almost completely inhibited in the presence of 20% human serum, the activity of Esc(1-18) against the gram-negative species was partially preserved in the presence of 40% serum. This property renders this peptide an attractive molecule for use in the development of new compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - Postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections: an unsolved problem in  thoracic surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics currently recommended for prophylaxis in thoracic surgery are first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins. Despite this prophylaxis, postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections remains frequent and severe. However, in the medical literature, the origin of these infections is poorly documented. METHODS: To evaluate the efficiency of current prophylactic regimens, we retrospectively analyzed 312 consecutive cases of major pulmonary resection, performed between January 2000 and December 2004. For patients who experienced postoperative pulmonary infection, the microbiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility were studied. RESULTS: A postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 76 patients (24.4% +/- 0.43%). Sixty patients (78.9%) experienced the infection in the first 5 postoperative days. A microbiologic documentation was obtained in 44 cases (57.9%) with 56 microorganisms involved. Pathogens responsible for the infections were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8), group B Streptococcus organisms (n = 1), nongroupable Streptococcus organisms (n = 2), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), Haemophilus spp. (n = 9), Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 15), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), and Candida spp. (n = 4). According to the antibiotic susceptibility testings, the prophylactic regimen by cefazolin proved ineffective for 84% of the microbiologically documented cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the inefficiency of current prophylaxis against pathogens involved in postoperative pneumonia after major lung resections. Evaluation of new and more-adapted approaches of antibiotic prophylaxis should be the subject of prospective multicenter trials.
TI  - Investigation of metallo-beta-lactamase producing strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii by E-test, disk synergy and PCR.
AB  - Carbapenem non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains were tested for the presence of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) by EDTA-synergy screening. Imipenem hydrolysis was investigated by a bioassay and IMP-/VIM-encoding genes by PCR. No bla(IMP/VIM) related genes or imipenemase activity were detected although E-test found all strains as MBL-positive. Disk synergy tests with 0.5 M EDTA determined 63.6-100%, while those with 0.1 M EDTA detected 0-7.7% of isolates as MBL producers. Most strains were susceptible to EDTA. In conclusion, for MBL-screening purposes, EDTA-synergy results change with molarity of EDTA, but even if some false positives are encountered, 0.1 M EDTA seems to be acceptable.
TI  - Carbapenemases: molecular diversity and clinical consequences.
AB  - Carbapenemases are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze most beta-lactams including carbapenems. Carbapenemases are classified in four molecular classes; those belonging to class A are the chromosomally-encoded and clavulanic acid-inhibited IMI, NMC-A and SME, identified in Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens; the plasmid-encoded KPC enzymes identified in Enterobacteriaceae (and rarely in Pseudomonas aeruginosa); and the GES-type enzymes identified in Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. The class B enzymes are the most clinically-significant carbapenemases; they are metallo-beta-lactamases, mostly of the IMP and the VIM series. They have been reported worldwide and their genes are plasmid- and integron-located, hydrolyzing all beta-lactams with the exception of aztreonam. One single plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase, CMY-10, identified in an Enterobacter aerogenes isolate, has been shown to be a cephaslosporinase with some carbapenemase properties. Finally, the class D carbapenemases are being increasingly reported, mostly in Acinetobacter baumannii, and they compromise the efficacy of imipenem and meropenem significantly.
TI  - Prevalence of nosocomial infection in Thailand 2006.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of nosocomial infection (NI). MATERIAL AND METHOD: A point prevalence study was done in 20 hospitals across the country in August 2006. RESULTS: The present study was done in 20 hospitals: three university, five regional, five provincial, and seven other hospitals. 9,865 patients were included Male and female patients were almost equal in number with an average age of 42.7 years. The NI proportion was 6.5%, 7.0% in male and 5.9% in female patients. The prevalence rate of NI was highest in university and other hospitals (7.6%), followed by provincial (6.0%), and regional hospital (4.9%). There were two hospitals, one regional and one other hospital with NI prevalence rates over 10%. All three university hospitals had NI exceeding 7%. The infection rate was highest in ICU (22.6%), followed by surgical (6.8%), medical and orthopedic (6.7% each) departments. The commonest site of NI was lower respiratory tract (36.1%) followed by urinary tract (25.5%). Causative organisms were identified in 70.8% of all sites of infection and over 63% were by bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 70.2% and gram-positive bacteria for 19.9% of all pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, MRSA, and enterococci were the leading bacterial isolates. At the time of the present study, 47.0% of patients were receiving antimicrobials. Cephalosporins, penicillins, and aminoglycosides were most commonly used CONCLUSION: The prevalence rate of NI in Thailand in 2006 was 6.5%, similar to previous studies. Changes in NI rates in certain hospitals, even though subtle, need additional studies to improve the efficacy of NI control.
TI  - Preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  - The aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. One hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. On the basis of these results, 80% alcohol, Octenidine 0.1%, and Chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. The results of the questionnaire revealed that Chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and Octenidine by 7% of the dentists. Using the in vitro model, with the exception of S. aureus, Chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. In contrast, the treatment with Octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. The 80% alcohol was more efficient. No growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. On the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or Octenidine using an incubation time of 15 min with ultrasonication.

TI  - Sensitivity pattern of gram negative bacilli to three beta-lactam/beta-lactamase  inhibitor combinations using the automated API system.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the spectrum of activity of three beta-lactamase inhibitors  such as amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid, ticarcillin/ clavulanic acid and piperacillin/ tazobactam in comparison to cephalosporins against gram negative bacilli. METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli isolated from the clinical specimens received in the laboratory were included in the study. Using the API system (bioMiotarieux) during a one-year period, a total of 1,252 Enterobacteriaceae and 385 non-fermenters were evaluated. RESULTS: The percentage resistance of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates was 82.92% to amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid, 58.22% to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid and 22.44% to piperacillin/tazobactam respectively. Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed resistance of 96% to ticarcillin/ clavulanic acid and 61% to piperacillin/ tazobactam and Acinetobacter baumannii showed 49% resistance to ticarcillin/ clavulanic acid and 77% resistance to piperacillin/ tazobactam respectively. The isolates exhibited high resistance to all the generations of cephalosporins and the other groups of antibiotics except carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: Piperacillin/tazobactam was found to be the most active combination of the three against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. and ticarcillin/clavulanic acid against Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
TI  - [The drug-resistant mechanism of clinical non-fermenting bacilli producing IMP-1  metalloenzyme].
AB  - A total of 50 clinical imipenem-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and  Acinetobacter baumannii were subjected to the ceftazidime-2- mercaptoethanol -double-disk synergy test and to the PCR assays with primers specific for bla(IMP-1). After the process of sequencing the positive one to identify the results, PCR analysis was conducted with primers specific for class 1 integrons. For synergy test, 28 isolates gave positive results, among which were 27 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Only one Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to carry bla(IMP-1), and bla(Int1) at the same time. This is the first ascertainment of IMP-1 producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate carrying bla(IntI1) in West China, which is of significance to the research on the clinical spread of these drug-resisitant genes.
TI  - Polymyxin B for the treatment of multidrug-resistant pathogens: a critical review.
AB  - Polymyxins have re-emerged in clinical practice owing to the dry antibiotic development pipeline and worldwide increasing prevalence of nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria. Polymyxin B and colistin (polymyxin E) have been ultimately considered as the last-resort treatment of such infections. Microbiological, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and clinical data available for polymyxin B are reviewed in this paper. Polymyxin B has rapid in vitro bactericidal activity against major MDR Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Acquired resistance to this agent is still rare among these pathogens. However, optimized dosage regimens are not known yet. Good clinical outcomes have been observed in the majority of the patients treated with intravenous polymyxin B in recent studies. However, these studies failed to provide definitive conclusions due to limitations of study design and additional clinical trials are required. Although combination therapy may be an attractive option based on some currently available in vitro data, clinical data supporting such recommendations are lacking. Since polymyxins will be increasingly used for the treatment of infections caused by MDR bacteria, clinical pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicodynamic studies underpinning the optimal use of these drugs are urgently required.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among organisms from the Asia/Pacific Rim, Europe and Latin and North America collected as part of TEST and the in vitro activity of tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates associated with hospital infections collected from 266 centres in Asia/Pacific Rim (n = 1,947), North America (n = 24,283), Latin America (n = 1,957) and Europe (n = 8,796). METHODS: Isolates were collected from blood, respiratory tract, urine, skin, wound, body fluids and other defined sources between January 2004 and August 2006. Only one isolate per patient was accepted. In vitro MICs for the isolates were determined according to the CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guidelines. RESULTS: Key organisms collected were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2,902), Enterobacter spp. (n = 5,731), Escherichia coli (n = 6,504), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4,916), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5,128), Serratia marcescens (n = 2,313), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 2,701), Enterococcus faecium (n = 1,035) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5,753). Rates of methicillin resistance among S. aureus and of vancomycin resistance among enterococci were highest in North America (2,016/3,809, 52.9% and 571/2,544, 22.4%, respectively) and lowest in Europe (337/1,340, 25.1% and 36/916, 3.9%, respectively). Tigecycline was the only antimicrobial to maintain activity against all Gram-positive isolates (MIC(90) values of <or=0.25 mg/L). Overall, tigecycline and imipenem were the most active (>93% susceptibility in all regions) antimicrobials against the Gram-negative species, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin were the most active against P. aeruginosa. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers among K. pneumoniae occurred most frequently in Latin America (124/282, 44.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline is a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial that is active against the common organisms associated with infections.
TI  - Empirical antibiotic therapy of sepsis in surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - Retrospective study was conducted in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in Clinical Hospital Center Zagreb in 2005. The aim of study was to create guidelines for empirical antibiotic therapy of sepsis in ICU for unknown causative agent based on antimicrobial susceptibility of causative bacteria. Thirty-two patients with severe sepsis were included in study and from medical records their clinical and microbiological data were analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains isolated from the blood-culture was tested by disk diffusion method according to CLSI (Clinical Laboratory Standard Institution). We used APACHE II score to predict the severity of illness. Mann-Whitney test and chi2 test were used to test statistical significance difference between results. Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the predominant causative agent. Acinetobacter baumannii was displaying excellent susceptibility to ampicillin+sulbactam and carbapenems, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa was showed good susceptibility on ceftazidim and carbapenems. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), third predominant causative agent exhibiting good susceptibility to vancomycin and linezolide. The recommended therapy is empirical antibiotic therapy and should cover all important pathogens.
TI  - Emerging issues in the management of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that treating seriously ill infected patients with active antibiotics early in the course of infection is critical to improving outcomes. The most common reason for ineffective empiric therapy is resistance to the agents used. Gram-negative bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to many commonly used antibiotics, and some cases require older, more toxic antibiotics for adequate microbial coverage. The diversity of resistance mechanisms that underly multidrug resistance makes developing effective new antimicrobial agents very difficult, especially against problematic species such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This growing problem requires a multipronged strategy that includes adherence to infection control principles, parsimonious and rational use of current antimicrobial agents, and development of new agents active against multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Incidence of class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Champagne-Ardenne (France): a 1 year prospective study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency and diversity of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in the Champagne-Ardenne region France, and to identify genetic elements associated with the bla(CTX-M) genes. METHODS: During 2004, all the non-duplicate isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to ceftazidime and of Enterobacteriaceae intermediate or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime, screening samples excluded, were collected in 10 public hospitals and 3 private clinics. bla genes were sequenced and bla(CTX-M) environment characterized by PCR mapping. RESULTS: In Enterobacteriaceae (138/21 861; 0.6%), ESBLs were predominantly TEM-24 (n = 52; 37.7%) and CTX-M-15 (n = 37; 26.8%). Three new enzymes were identified, CTX-M-61 (CTX-M-1 group), TEM- and SHV-type. A. baumannii (n = 5) produced VEB-1 and P. aeruginosa (n = 2) SHV-2a. ISEcp1 was detected in 22/27 strains, disrupted in 7 of them. The IS903-like element was downstream of bla(CTX-M-14) and bla(CTX-M-16). ISCR1 was found upstream of bla(CTX-M-2) and bla(CTX-M-9), and ISCR1 and bla(CTX-M-2) were located on a sul1-type class 1 integron. In comparison with 2001-02, ESBL distribution among Enterobacteriaceae showed an increase in CTX-M-type (44.9% vs 3.7% P < 10(-7)) due to Escherichia coli CTX-M-15 and to the almost total disappearance of TEM-3 (0.9% vs 51.2%). E. coli was the most frequent species (50.0% vs 5.1% in 1998) despite a similar prevalence to that in 1998 (0.5% vs 0.2%). CONCLUSIONS: A careful detection of bla(CTX-M)-type spread to other species would help to anticipate clonal endemics such as those observed in Enterobacter aerogenes TEM-24.
TI  - Old antibiotics for infections in critically ill patients.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The alarming epidemic of multidrug-resistant bacteria and the  reluctance of the pharmaceutical industry to invest in the development of new antibiotics have forced clinicians to reintroduce forgotten antibiotics into their practice. This review highlights the effectiveness and safety of older antibiotics when used in the treatment of infections of critically ill patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Polymyxins emerged as useful antibiotics for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, in particular Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity associated with their use are less frequent and serious than previously reported. In addition, aerosolized polymyxins may be a useful weapon in the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Fosfomycin and chloramphenicol have a wide antimicrobial spectrum, are used extensively in Europe and Africa, respectively, and may have an expanded role in our antimicrobial arsenal. Fusidic acid remains active against various staphylococcal strains, while isepamicin (an aminoglycoside used in some European countries) is slightly more effective than amikacin against some Gram-negative bacteria. SUMMARY: The declining investment of the pharmaceutical industry in the development of new antibiotics and the increasing antimicrobial resistance create a fertile ground for the study and, probably, revival of older antibiotics for use, especially in critically ill patients.
TI  - [Selective action of broad-spectrum antibiotics on intestinal flora in sepsis in  rats].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the selective effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the intestinal flora in sepsis in rats. METHODS: Fifty-six SD rats were randomly divided into normal control group, scald group [before ceftriaxone sodium (rocephin) treatment group], scald group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, scald group with 9 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group (before rocephin treatment group), sepsis group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group with 9 days of rocephin treatment. All the animals were incurred with 30% III degree burns on their back followed by endotoxin challenge with a dose of 20 mg/kg 24 hours after the burn injury. The animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone 24 hours (60 mg/kg, quaque 12 hours) after the second hit with endotoxin. At the end of the treatment, the bacteria in stomach, intestine and colon were cultured. The number and kind of the bacteria were also determined. RESULTS: Antibiotics significantly increased the number of cocci (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The ratio between cocci and bacilli was markedly inverted. In selective culture of gut bacilli, E.Coli was almost the only bacteria in the contents of stomach, intestine and colon in normal control group, but after burns and endotoxin challenge, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis appeared. After the rats received antibiotics treatment, E. coli decreased in number or disappeared, and was replaced mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus and other bacilli. CONCLUSION: Broad-spectrum antibiotics can induce imbalance of bacteria flora in the gut, resulting in a reversion of the ratio between cocci and bacilli, and also reduction in intestinal colonization resistance. Then, opportunistic pathogens become dominant flora in gut, which may cause antibiotic-related gut-origin diseases.

TI  - In vitro efficacy of copper and silver ions in eradicating Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii: implications for on-site disinfection for hospital infection control.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii  are major opportunistic waterborne pathogens causing hospital-acquired infections. Copper-silver ionization has been shown to be effective in controlling Legionella colonization in hospital water systems. The objective was to determine the efficacy of copper and silver ions alone and in combination in eradicating P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia and A. baumannii at the concentration applied to Legionella control. Kill curve experiments and mathematical modeling were conducted at copper and silver ion concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08 mg/L, respectively. The combinations of copper and silver ions were tested at concentrations of 0.2/0.02 and 0.4/0.04 mg/L, respectively. Initial organism concentration was ca. of 3 x 10(6)cfu/mL, and viability of the test organisms was assessed at predetermined time intervals. Samples (0.1 mL) withdrawn were mixed with 10 microL neutralizer solution immediately, serially diluted and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates. The culture plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C and enumerated for the cfu (detection limit 10 cfu/mL). The results showed all copper ion concentrations tested (0.1-0.8 mg/L) achieved more than 99.999% reduction of P. aeruginosa which appears to be more susceptible to copper ions than S. maltophilia and A. baumannii. Silver ions concentration of 0.08 mg/L achieved more than 99.999% reduction of P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia and A. baumannii in 6, 12 and 96 h, respectively. Combination of copper and silver ions exhibited a synergistic effect against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii while the combination exhibited an antagonistic effect against S. maltophilia. Ionization may have a potential to eradicate P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia and A. baumannii from hospital water systems.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic target attainment of seven antimicrobials against Gram-negative bacteria collected from China in 2003 and 2004.
AB  - Using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data derived from a Chinese national surveillance study and pharmacokinetic data collected in Chinese individuals, a 5000-subject Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to determine the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for cefoperazone/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and meropenem against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected during 2003 and 2004. The carbapenems had the highest CFRs against the Enterobacteriaceae (94.7-100%) and A. baumannii (66.0-86.3%). Ceftazidime, meropenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam obtained the greatest CFRs against P. aeruginosa (73.9-86.6% in Southern China and 64.8-82.1% in Northern China). All other cephalosporin and ciprofloxacin regimens achieved < or =50% CFR against all bacterial species. Meropenem 2g every 8h as a 3-h infusion displayed ca. 90% CFR against A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Pharmacodynamic analyses are useful for selecting optimal compounds and dosing regimens as initial empirical therapy against these organisms in China.
TI  - Carbapenemases: the versatile beta-lactamases.
AB  - Carbapenemases are beta-lactamases with versatile hydrolytic capacities. They have the ability to hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Bacteria producing these beta-lactamases may cause serious infections in which the carbapenemase activity renders many beta-lactams ineffective. Carbapenemases are members of the molecular class A, B, and D beta-lactamases. Class A and D enzymes have a serine-based hydrolytic mechanism, while class B enzymes are metallo-beta-lactamases that contain zinc in the active site. The class A carbapenemase group includes members of the SME, IMI, NMC, GES, and KPC families. Of these, the KPC carbapenemases are the most prevalent, found mostly on plasmids in Klebsiella pneumoniae. The class D carbapenemases consist of OXA-type beta-lactamases frequently detected in Acinetobacter baumannii. The metallo-beta-lactamases belong to the IMP, VIM, SPM, GIM, and SIM families and have been detected primarily in Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, there are increasing numbers of reports worldwide of this group of beta-lactamases in the Enterobacteriaceae. This review updates the characteristics, epidemiology, and detection of the carbapenemases found in pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Impact of an antibiotic restriction policy on the antibiotic resistance patterns  of Gram-negative microorganisms in an Intensive Care Unit in Greece.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of an antibiotic policy programme based on restriction of the empirical use of fluoroquinolones and ceftazidime on the susceptibilities of Gram-negative microorganisms in a general Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The epidemiology of infections caused by the predominant ICU pathogens, i.e. Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and their resistance patterns as well as antibiotic consumption were recorded for a 6-month period. An antibiotic restriction policy including ceftazidime and quinolones was applied. After an 18-month period of protocol application, the same parameters were recorded for another 6-month period. Consumption of restricted and overall antibiotics was reduced by 92.5% and 55.4%, respectively. Susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin of the three predominant infection-causing Gram-negative bacilli were significantly increased. Ceftazidime showed an increase in susceptibility only for P. aeruginosa. Similar rates of infectious episodes were recorded in the two periods and no differences were observed either in overall mortality or in ICU ecology as expressed by the type of microorganisms implicated in colonisation and/or infection. The reported data suggest that an antibiotic restriction policy can significantly reduce antimicrobial consumption and antimicrobial resistance rates, although the latter effect can be also influenced by the prevalent resistance mechanisms and the prevalence of imported resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity against gram negative bacilli from Yaounde Central Hospital, Cameroon.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance among bacteria pathogens is a world-wide issue. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of common pathogenic bacteria are essential to guide empirical and pathogen-specific therapy; unfortunately, these data are scarse in Cameroon. OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative bacilli isolated in Yaounde Central Hospital Laboratory of Bacteriology. METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 505), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) in Yaounde Central Hospital Laboratory of Bacteriology between March 1995 and April 1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. RESULTS: High rates of resistance were found in most of the bacteria studied. Resistance to all isolates was mostly observed for amoxicillin (87%), piperacillin (74%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (73%). Susceptibilities to third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) and monobactame (aztreonam) were = 91% for Escherichia coli, = 71% for Klebsiella spp., = 98% for Proteus mirabilis, = 50% for Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was less susceptible to cefotaxime (2%) and aztreonam (33%), and highly susceptible to ceftazidime (72%) whereas Acinetobacter baumannii was highly resistant to aztreonam (100%), to cefotaxime (96%) and cetazidime (62%). Imipenem (98%) was the most active antibiotic followed by the ofloxacine (88%). Susceptibility of all isolates to gentamicin was 67%. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that surveillance to antimicrobial resistance in Cameroon is necessary to monitor microbial trends, antimicrobial resistance pattern, and provide information for choosing empirical or direct therapy to physicians.
TI  - Convenient test using a combination of chelating agents for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in the clinical laboratory.
AB  - Although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the CLSI currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of MBLs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (DDTs) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and Tris-EDTA (TE) to detect MBLs. Sixteen isolates (4 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 Serratia marcescens isolate, 1 Aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 Aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 Chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing IMP-1, IMP-1-like, IMP-18, GIM-1, SPM-1, VIM-2, VIM-2-like, and chromosomal MBLs and 20 isolates (7 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 Escherichia coli isolates, 5 Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 S. marcescens isolates, 1 Proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 A. baumannii isolates) producing non-MBL carbapenemases, AmpC beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. The DDT method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (TE, high-strength TE, MPA, and TE plus 20 microl of MPA [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEM), ertapenem (ERT), and ceftazidime (CAZ). DDTs with IPM and a TE disk supplemented with 1:320 MPA detected all MBLs and yielded no false-positive results. Some, but not all, MBL producers were detected in IPM-based tests involving the single chelator TE or MPA alone or by ERT- or CAZ-based tests. IPM-based tests with MPA concentrations other than 1:320 and all MEM-based tests had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. DDT with IPM and a TE disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 MPA appears to be convenient for the detection of MBLs in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - [Clinical distribution and antibiotic resistance of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli infection after liver transplantation].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli infections after liver transplantation, and to analyze the antibiotic susceptibility to major pathogens. METHODS: A retrospective survey was conducted to 292 patients who underwent liver transplantation in the period of January 2004 and September 2006. With MicroScan Walkaway- 40 Automatic System, the non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli infection was analyzed for the identification of pathogens and susceptibility to drugs. RESULTS: Non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli infection was identified in 33. 9% of 292 patients after liver transplantation. A total of 99 non-duplicate strains were isolated. The infection was frequently identified from respiratory tract, biliary tract, blood stream and intra-abdominal cavity. The top 3 pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Those non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli were usually resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION: The non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli of postoperative infections in liver transplantation recipients are mostly multi-drug resistant. The microbiological surveillance is important for guiding clinical therapy.
TI  - Emerging and unusual gram-negative infections in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - People with cystic fibrosis (CF) have chronic airway infection and frequent exposure to antibiotics, which often leads to the emergence of resistant organisms. In addition to the development of multiresistance in common CF pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, several newer, inherently resistant gram-negative species are becoming more common, including Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter (Alcaligenes) xylosoxidans, certain Ralstonia species, and those within the new genus Pandoraea. Many of these are closely related and have similar phenotypes, making accurate laboratory identification challenging. Although their role in contributing to pulmonary disease in CF is not clear, some, such as those of the B. cepacia complex, are clearly linked to an adverse prognosis, and both treatment and infection control issues can pose a real challenge.
TI  - Neuroinfections and antimicrobials: do we need new molecules or new strategies?
AB  - Within last 15 years, analyzing patterns of etiology and resistance in organisms  causing neuroinfections, emergence of resistance has been observed in Slovakia in S. haemolyticus to teicoplanin (11%), Ps. aeruginosa and A. baumannii to meropenem (20%) and Candida spp. (non-albicans Candida spp.) to fluconazol (20%). There are no new antibiotics against carbapenem resistant Ps. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
TI  - Neuroinfections in developed versus developing countries.
AB  - In recent supplement of neuroendocrinology letters, first time the authors from West and East, North and South of EU and the "Third World" present data on neuroinfections in high technology society - on nosocomial meningitis and vice versa in low technology and income countries of sub-Saharan Africa. 14 years survey of 171 cases of nosocomial paediatric meningitis is presented by Rudinsky et al. [1] and subpopulations of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [1,2] within last 20 years are briefly analyzed by Huttova et al. [2] and Ondrusova et al. [3]. All cases were complicating high technology procedures, such as neurosurgery, very low birth weight neonates after shunt implants etc. Current problems of management of nosocomial meningitis are reviewed by Bauer et al. [4] and consequence of inappropriate therapy by Huttova et al. [5]. Another high technology associated infection is septic embolisation followed by brain abscess and meningitis in patients with endocarditis after cardiac surgery (Kovac et al.) [6]. Experience from more than 600 cases is discussed in the article by Karvaj et al. [7] who outlines extremely high mortality in patients with endocarditis embolizing to central nervous system - up to 60%. The rest of papers are in contrary to problems of neuroinfections in EU and US focused on meningitis and cerebral malaria as commonest neuroinfections in the third world: 261 cases of cerebral malaria are discussed in a brief research note by Sudanese team of tropical programme in area of famine and civil war in southern Sudan (Bartkovjak and Ianetti et al.) [8]. Fungal neuroinfections complicating AIDS are of decreasing trend as reported by Njambi et al. from Kenya [9] and data from 497 cases from Uganda, Ethiopia and Burundi are presented by Benca et al. [10]. Finally an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis is reported by Benca et al. [11] from meningitis belt in Darfur and southern Sudan. We hope that the supplement may show difference in etiology, risk factors, therapy and outcome of neuroinfections (which is a burning public health and social problem in tropics) in other third world countries versus developed high-tech medical settings of US, EU and other high income countries, as presented by Benca et al. [12].
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of heparin on common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - AIM: The mucolytic, anticoagulative, anti-inflammatory and neo-angiogenic properties of inhaled heparin may benefit patients with burns and cystic fibrosis. We assessed the antibacterial effects of unfractionated heparin. METHODS: Stored clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii (n =4), Candida albicans (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n =5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n =4), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n=3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7) were subcultured on horse blood agar, incubated at 35 degrees C overnight, then inoculated into trypticase soy broth to a density of 1 McFarland standard. Dilutions of unfractionated heparin (containing 250- 7500 U) and 100 microL of the 1.0 McFarland standard broth were incubated at 35 degrees C overnight in microtitre plates and then subcultured on horse blood agar using 1 microL standard loops. Colonies (representing viable organisms) were counted. RESULTS: Heparin produced dose-dependent growth inhibition of three of seven S. pneumoniae isolates (complete inhibition at 2500U dose per 200 microL) and one of five H. influenzae isolates (complete inhibition at 7500 U dose per 200 microL), but no inhibition of other isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Unfractionated heparin is unlikely to have antibacterial effects because of its unpredictable inhibition of growth of common respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of colistin compared with imipenem in the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a matched case-control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of colistin in the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by pan-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumanii. DESIGN: Pairwise, retrospective exposed-unexposed study. SETTING: Combined medical and surgical intensive care unit of Habib Bourguiba University Hospital (Sfax, Tunisia). PATIENTS: Sixty patients with VAP caused by pan-drug-resistant A. baumanii or P. aeruginosa matched to 60 controls with VAP caused by A. baumanii or P. aeruginosa susceptible to imipenem. All patients had normal renal function at the onset of antibiotic therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Case patients were treated by colistin intravenously and control patients were treated by imipenem intravenously. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between the colistin and imipenem groups. The mean duration of antibiotic therapy for VAP was 9.5+/-3.8 days (range 5-22 days) with colistin and 8.9+/-2.8 days (range 5-20 days) with imipenem (p=0.32). A favorable clinical response to antibiotic therapy for VAP occurred in 45 patients (75%) in the colistin group and in 43 patients (71.7%) in the imipenem group (p=0.68). The time to resolution of infectious parameters after the initiation of antibiotic therapy was not statistically different between the two groups. During the antibiotic course, none of the patients in either group developed renal failure. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that colistin can be a safe and effective option in the treatments of VAP caused by pan-drug-resistant P. aeruginosa or A. baumanii.
TI  - When to include polymyxins in the empirical antibiotic regimen in critically ill  patients with fever? A decision analysis approach.
AB  - We sought to approach a practical question: Should polymyxins be used in the initial empirical antibiotic regimen in the intensive care unit (ICU) patient with fever that is thought to be due to infection? By retrieving data from the literature and the WHONET Greece, we formulated a mathematical model to estimate the probability (Ptotal) that a gram-negative bacterium susceptible only to polymyxins is isolated from an ICU patient. Ptotal = P1 * P2 * P3 * P4, where Ptotal = total probability; P1 = probability that fever is due to infection; P2 = probability that infection is due to gram-negative bacteria; P3 = probability that the gram-negative bacterium is Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Klebsiella pneumoniae; and P4 = probability that A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, or K. pneumoniae is susceptible only to polymyxins. Using the information from our data sources, we estimated that P1 (before physician input in differential diagnosis) = 0.5, P2 = 0.523, P3 = 0.79, and P4 = 0.567, thus Ptotal = P1 * P2 * P3 * P4 = 0.5 * 0.523 * 0.79 * 0.567 = 0.117 = 11.7%. Based on this information and combining it with data regarding the attributable mortality of inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment, 4 to 5 patients in every 100 ICU patients will die if physicians do not include polymyxins in the initial empirical regimen in the ICU setting for an episode of fever due to infection. Polymyxins should probably be included in the empirical antibiotic regimen in the ICU setting in hospitals, where the observed probability that a gram-negative bacterium (A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, or K. pneumoniae) is polymyxin-only-susceptible is close to that (50%) used in our model (based on the individual hospital data).
TI  - Resistance to disinfectants in epidemiologically defined clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Decreased susceptibility to biocides may contribute to epidemic spread of Acinetobacter baumannii in the hospital. This study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of different clinical A. baumannii strains to disinfectants. Twenty A. baumannii strains were examined, ten of which were outbreak-related and ten that were sporadic. Clinical isolates were selected on the basis of demonstrating a unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern. The in-vitro activities of propanol, combination of 1-propanol, 2-propanol and mecetronium ethylsulphate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-iodine, triclosan and chlorhexidine were determined using a broth macrodilution method. Exposure times to the disinfectant ranged from 15 s to 2 min and concentrations ranged from undiluted to a 1:4000 dilution in order to investigate the impact of inadvertent dilution that might occur in clinical practice. Five American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) type strains (A. baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus) were used as controls. All disinfectants inhibited growth of all isolates at concentrations and contact times recommended by the respective manufacturer. With most of the disinfectants tested, a relevant number of viable bacteria remained if contact times < 30s or diluted agents were used. No significant differences in susceptibility between outbreak-related and sporadic strains were detected, but larger studies would be required to confirm this. Resistance to currently used disinfectants is probably not a major factor in the epidemic spread of A. baumannii. However, even minor deviations from the recommended procedures leading to decreased concentrations or exposure times may play a role in nosocomial cross-transmission.
TI  - Evolution of antimicrobial resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae in Brooklyn, NY.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To document resistance patterns of three important nosocomial pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, present in hospitals in Brooklyn, NY. METHODS: Susceptibility profiles of pathogens gathered during a surveillance study in 2006 were analysed and compared with similar surveys performed in 1999 and 2001. MICs were determined according to CLSI standards, and selected isolates were screened by PCR for the presence of VIM, IMP and KPC beta-lactamases. RESULTS: For P. aeruginosa, susceptibility to most antimicrobials fell in 2001 and then reached a plateau. However, there was a progressive decrease in the number of patients with P. aeruginosa during the three surveys. While the total number of isolates of A. baumannii remained steady, there was a progressive decrease in susceptibility to most classes of antimicrobial agents, and approximately one-third had combined resistance to carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. There was a noticeable rise in the number of isolates of K. pneumoniae over the surveillance periods, suggesting that this has become the predominant pathogen in many medical centres. Over one-third of K. pneumoniae collected in 2006 carried the carbapenemase KPC, and 22% were resistant to all three classes of antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals in our region have been beset with antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. K. pneumoniae has rapidly emerged as the most common multidrug-resistant pathogen. Improved therapeutic agents and methods of detection are needed to reduce transmission of these bacteria.
TI  - Prediction of specific pathogens in patients with sepsis: evaluation of TREAT, a  computerized decision support system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prediction of bacterial infections and their pathogens allows for early, directed investigation and treatment. We assessed the ability of TREAT, a computerized decision support system, to predict specific pathogens. METHODS: TREAT uses data available within the first few hours of infection presentation in a causal probabilistic network to predict sites of infection and specific pathogens. We included 3529 patients (920 with microbiologically documented infections) participating in the observational and interventional trials of the TREAT system in Israel, Germany and Italy. Discriminatory performance of TREAT to predict individual pathogens was expressed by the AUC with 95% confidence intervals. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. RESULTS: The AUCs for Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, ranged between 0.70 and 0.80 (all significant). Adequate calibration was demonstrated for any Gram-negative infection and individual bacteria, except for E. coli. Discrimination and calibration were acceptable for Enterococcus spp. (AUC 0.71, 0.65-0.78), but not for Staphylococcus aureus (AUC 0.63, 0.55-0.71). The few infections caused by Candida spp. and Clostridium difficile were well predicted (AUCs 0.74, 0.54-0.95; and 0.94, 0.88-1.00, respectively). The coverage with TREAT's recommendation exceeded that observed with physicians' treatment for all pathogens, except Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: TREAT predicted individual pathogens causing infection well. Prediction of S. aureus was inferior to that observed with other pathogens. TREAT can be used to triage patients by the risk for specific pathogens. The system's predictions enable it to prescribe appropriate antibiotic treatment prior to pathogen identification.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activities of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam against aerobic bacterial pathogens from patients with nosocomial infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is a rapid worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, especially in nosocomial isolates. This study compared the in vitro activities of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 208 aerobic bacterial pathogens that caused 197 nosocomial infections in 184 patients. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated by E test in accordance with the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. RESULTS: Most (140/208, 67%) of the isolates were facultative Gram-negative bacilli. Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were the most effective (22/22, 100%) against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. None of the antibiotics tested were found to be effective (0/25) against oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 11 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii that were not pandrug-resistant (PDR), only 9 isolates (9/11, 81%) were sensitive to imipenem and 5 isolates (5/11, 45%) were sensitive to levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime. Another 22 isolates of A. baumannii that were PDR were completely resistant to all 6 antibiotics. The majority of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to these 6 antimicrobial agents with 10/11 (91%) sensitive to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, 9/11 (83%) sensitive to ceftazidime, cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, and 8/11 (75%) sensitive to imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the bacterial isolates causing nosocomial infections were found to be sensitive to the 6 antibiotics tested. Bacterial isolates of nosocomial infections that were completely resistant to these 6 antibiotics were PDR A. baumannii, PDR P. aeruginosa, and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. More potent antimicrobial agents are needed to treat infections caused by PDR A. baumannii and PDR P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility profile of selected bacteraemic pathogens from private institutions in South Africa.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The National Antimicrobial Surveillance Forum is a continuous surveillance organisation comprising all academic/public and private sector laboratories in South Africa. METHODS: The antibiotic susceptibility of blood culture isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus from patients in private hospitals in five major centres were investigated. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by 12 participating laboratories according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production was determined in selected species of Enterobacteriaceae irrespective of source. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of ampicillin resistance in blood culture isolates of E. coli (N = 471) was 84%, and 20% were resistant to the fluoroquinolones. Considerable geographical differences were noted between the centres with regard to the K. pneumoniae (N = 636) resistance rates for ceftriaxone and/or cefotaxime (39 - 87%). The most active agents in the Enterobacter spp. (N = 244) were imipenem/meropenem, ertapenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and cefepime, with 100%, 94%, 88%, 87% and 80% susceptibility, respectively. Carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa (N = 382) varied between 42% and 45%, and in the case of A. baumannii (N = 190) resistance varied between 32% and 33% for meropenem and imipenem respectively. The nationwide incidence of oxacillin resistance in S. aureus (N = 629) was 36%. Overall, the prevalence of ESBL production among all isolates of K. pneumoniae was 26% (N = 7 514), while in Enterobacter spp. it was 12% (N = 4 031) and in E. coli 5% (N = 28 412). CONCLUSIONS: The data highlight the widespread problem of antibiotic resistance among important bacteraemic pathogens in private institutions in South Africa. Continued surveillance is vital to guide appropriate empirical therapy for invasive infections.
TI  - Effect of a policy for restriction of selected classes of antibiotics on antimicrobial drug cost and resistance.
AB  - Based on the instructions of the National Organization of Pharmaceutical Agents (Greece) from July 1, 2003, quinolones, 3( rd )and 4(th )generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, glycopeptides, oxazolidinones, and streptogramins were considered as "restricted" antibiotics that could be used only with the approval of an Infectious Disease specialist. We analyzed the effect of the policy on the consumption and cost of antibiotics as a group and of specific classes, adjusted for the patient load, as well as on the antimicrobial resistance of isolated bacteria. We analyzed 5 trimesters (2 prior and 3 after the implementation of the new policy). A 20% and 16% reduction in adjusted consumption [in daily defined doses (DDDs)] and cost, respectively, of the restricted antibiotics was accomplished during the first trimester after implementation of the new policy. However, this was accompanied by a 36% and 56% increase in adjusted consumption and cost, respectively, of unrestricted antibiotics. A logistic regression model that we performed showed that the new policy had an independent positive effect on the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p=0.051) but not of Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli isolates. Our data suggest that there are considerable limitations to the programs aiming to reduce the consumption of restricted antibiotics through the approval of their use by specialists, at least in some settings.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Aerosolised antibacterials for the prevention and treatment of hospital-acquired  pneumonia.
AB  - Aerosolised administration of antibacterials remains theoretically attractive for the prevention and treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) because of the ability to generate high drug concentrations at the site of infection. There is renewed interest in this area because of the shortcomings of current therapies and increasing multidrug resistance in Gram-negative organisms. Clinical trials of aerosolised or endotracheally administered antibacterials for HAP prevention have generally been positive; however, early trials were hampered by the development of resistance related to indiscriminate use. More recent trials have shown efficacy at HAP prevention without adverse effects on microflora as a result of more limited usage. However, prophylactic aerosolised antibacterials still need to be studied in large randomised trials before they could enter widespread use. The treatment of HAP with aerosolised antibacterials has mostly been reported in case series without control groups. Both early reports with aminoglycosides and the more recent use of colistin have reported very good response rates; even with organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Aerosolised antibacterials were almost always added to intravenous therapy. On the basis of these reports, the current HAP guidelines allow the addition of aerosolised antibacterials in selected patients with multidrug-resistant organisms. This seems to be a reasonable recommendation until large trials are performed. Overall, toxicity was relatively low in the publications reviewed. Aerosolised drug administration in mechanically ventilated patients requires attention to a number of factors in order to maximise drug deposition in the lung.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial profiles of selected isoquinoline alkaloids from Fumaria and Corydalis species.
AB  - In the current study, 33 isoquinoline alkaloids belonging to protopine-, benzylisoquinoline-, benzophenanthridine-, spirobenzylisoquinoline-, phthalideisoquinoline-, aporphine-, protoberberine-, cularine-, and isoquinolone-types as well as 7 derivatives of them obtained from some Fumaria and Corydalis species growing in Turkey have been evaluated for their in vitro antiviral and antimicrobial activities. Both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madine-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines and their maximum non-toxic concentrations (MNTC) and cytopathogenic effects (CPE) were determined using acyclovir and oseltamivir as the references. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the alkaloids were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans by the microdilution method and compared to ampicilline, ofloxacine, and ketocanazole as the references. The alkaloids did not present any notable antibacterial effect, while they had significant antifungal activity at 8 microg/ml concentration. On the other hand, the alkaloids were found to have selective inhibition against the PI-3 virus ranging between 0.5 and 64 microg/ml as minimum and maximum CPE inhibitory concentrations, whereas they were completely inactive towards HSV.
TI  - Relationship between immunosuppression and intensive care unit-acquired multidrug-resistant bacteria: a case-control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between immunosuppression and intensive  care unit (ICU)-acquired multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study based on prospectively collected data. SETTING: A 30-bed medical and surgical ICU. PATIENTS: All patients hospitalized >48 hrs in the ICU were eligible during a 2-yr period. INTERVENTIONS: Immunosuppression was defined as active solid or hematologic malignancy, leucopenia, or chronic immunosuppressive treatment. MDR bacteria were defined as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime- or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and extending spectrum beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. MDR bacteria screening (nasal, anal, and axilla swabs and tracheal aspirate in intubated patients) was performed at ICU admission and weekly. Only MDR bacteria isolated >48 hrs after ICU admission were taken into account; duplicates were excluded. Isolation measures were applied in all patients at ICU admission, in patients with MDR bacteria, and in patients with immunosuppression. Immunosuppressed patients (cases) were matched (1:1) with immunocompetent patients (controls) according to all the following criteria: age +/-5 yrs, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II +/-5, duration of ICU stay +/-3 days, and category of admission (medical/surgical). Risk factors for ICU-acquired MDR bacteria were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1,065 eligible patients, nine patients were excluded for absence of MDR bacteria screening at ICU admission. One hundred thirty-three (12%) patients were immunosuppressed, and 128 (96%) of them were successfully matched. Mean time between ICU admission and first ICU-acquired MDR bacteria was 12 +/- 9 days. Incidence of MDR bacteria was significantly higher in cases than in controls (22 vs. 12 MDR bacteria/1000 ICU days, p = .004). However, immunosuppression was not independently associated with ICU-acquired MDR bacteria.Multivariate analysis identified prior antibiotic treatment and antibiotic treatment in the ICU as risk factors for ICU-acquired MDR bacteria (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.9 [1-3.6], p = .003; 11 [1.4-83], p = .02; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppression is not independently associated with ICU-acquired MDR bacteria. However, infection control measures used in our ICU may have influenced this result.
TI  - New antibiotics, efflux pumps and overcoming resistance.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a contemporary problem affecting patients, doctors, microbiologists and the wider medical community. The patients include both those who are hospitalised and those treated in the community. The doctors include physicians and surgeons alike. The wider medical community is affected by outbreaks, bed closures, costs and a far-reaching impact on the efficient functioning of the healthcare system. Solutions to the problem of antibiotic resistance are often at odds with the practical need for doctors to treat patients with the very antibiotics which are fuelling the problem.
TI  - Reevaluation of current susceptibility breakpoints for Gram-negative rods based on pharmacodynamic assessment.
AB  - Although pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling is now being considered for decision support for susceptibility breakpoint determination against Gram-negative bacteria, these PD-derived breakpoints should be verified using a clinically applicable population of organisms. In this analysis, a 5000-patient Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine PD breakpoints, the highest 2-fold MIC in which the probability of bactericidal target attainment (PTA) remained > or = 90%. Percent susceptibilities for 639 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 103 Acinetobacter baumannii, 705 Escherichia coli, and 418 Klebsiella spp. collected during the 2004 Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection surveillance study were then defined according to the PD-derived breakpoint (%S(PD)) and compared with the current Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)-defined breakpoints (%S(CLSI)). %S(PD) and %S(CLSI) were compared with the bactericidal PTA for each pathogen population to determine the degree of agreement. Resulting PD breakpoints were drug and dose dependent; moreover, values were commonly 2 to 4 MIC dilutions lower than CLSI breakpoints. Overall, %S(PD) more closely agreed with the PTA for the tested beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone dosing regimens. In contrast, %S(CLSI) overestimated PTA for many dosing regimens, especially against Pseudomonas: piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g qid (+9.7%), ciprofloxacin 0.4 g bid (+13.7%) and 0.4 g tid (+9.3%), and levofloxacin 0.5 g every 24 h (+22.4%) and 0.75 g every 24 h (+9.9%). Differences were most pronounced against the nonfermenting Gram-negative bacteria and were not observed among the Enterobacteriaceae. As a result, a new method of breakpoint classification is proposed, which is dosing regimen and pathogen specific, and is designed to denote isolates as susceptible only if target bactericidal exposures are achievable with the dosing regimen selected.
TI  - Carbapenems for the treatment of immunocompetent adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  - The comparative effectiveness and safety of carbapenems with other beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones for the empirical treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia remains controversial. In the present study, a meta-analysis of 12 relevant randomised controlled trials was performed. Overall, carbapenems were associated with lower mortality than fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams, alone or in combination with aminoglycosides (odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.95). There was no difference between the compared antibiotics regarding treatment success (1.08, 0.91-1.29), microbiological success (1.04, 0.72-1.50) or development of adverse effects (0.81, 0.46-1.43). In the subset of patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, carbapenems were associated with lower treatment success (0.42, 0.22-0.82) and lower eradication of P. strains (0.50, 0.24-0.89). Carbapenems are equivalent to fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams, alone or in combination with aminoglycosides, for the empirical treatment of immunocompetent adult patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia. However, there is limited evidence, based predominantly on unblinded randomised controlled trials, that carbapenems are associated with lower mortality than the comparators; this association was not observed in a subset analysis of randomised controlled trials with a high methodological quality score. In patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, carbapenems are associated with worse outcomes than the comparators.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic target attainment of six beta-lactams and two fluoroquinolones against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella species collected from United States intensive care units in 2004.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the likelihood that antibiotic regimens achieve bactericidal pharmacodynamic exposures against common nosocomial pathogens. DESIGN: Pharmacodynamic Monte Carlo simulation model. DATA SOURCE: Microbiologic data generated from isolates from the 14 centers in the United States in the 2004 Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) surveillance study. PATIENTS: Five thousand simulated patients with infection. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic profiles of the patients were simulated to determine the bactericidal cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for commonly used intravenous regimens of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella species. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin had CFRs among the lowest of all drugs against all pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa (40.4-65.5%) and A. baumannii (43.6-48.2%). The low CFR of about 78% against E. coli with these two agents was of particular concern. Among the beta-lactams, only high-dose cefepime and ceftazidime regimens achieved CFRs of greater than 90% against P. aeruginosa, followed by cefepime 2 g every 12 hours and the carbapenems (86.3-89.7%). No regimen achieved an optimum CFR for A. baumannii. All beta-lactam regimens achieved a greater-than-90% likelihood of having bactericidal CFRs against Enterobacteriaceae. CONCLUSION: Because of the continual evolution of resistance among gram-negative bacteria in the United States, reevaluation of optimum dosing strategies for beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone antibiotics is necessary.
TI  - Pandrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria: the dawn of the post-antibiotic era?
AB  - The evolving problem of antimicrobial resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae has led to the emergence of clinical isolates susceptible to only one class of antimicrobial agents and eventually to pandrug-resistant (PDR) isolates, i.e. resistant to all available antibiotics. We reviewed the available evidence from laboratory and clinical studies that reported on polymyxin-resistant and/or PDR P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii or K. pneumoniae clinical isolates. Eleven laboratory studies reported on isolates with resistance to polymyxins, three of which (including two surveillance studies) also included data regarding PDR isolates. In addition, two clinical studies (from Central and Southern Europe) reported on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients infected with PDR isolates. These data suggest that polymyxin-resistant or PDR P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae clinical isolates are currently relatively rare. However, they have important global public health implications because of the therapeutic problems they pose. The fears for the dawn of a post-antibiotic era appear to be justified, at least for these three Gram-negative bacteria. We must increase our efforts to preserve the activity of available antibiotics, or at least expand as much as possible the period of their use, whilst intense research efforts should be focused on the development and introduction into clinical practice of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [National Study of Control of Nosocomial Infection in Intensive Care Units. Evolutive report of the years 2003-2005].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe the national rates of acquired invasive device-related infections in the ICU during 2003, 2004 and 2005, their etiology and evolution of the multiresistance markers. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SCOPE: Intensive Care Unit or other units where critical patients are admitted. PATIENTS: 21,608 patients admitted for more than 24 hours in the participating ICUs. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Device related infections: pneumonias related with mechanical ventilation (N-MV), urinary infections related with urethral probe (UI-UP) and primary bacteriemias (PB) and/or those related with at risk vascular catheters (BCV). RESULTS: In 2,279 (10.5%) patients, 3,151 infections were detected: 1,469 N-MV, 808 UI-UP and 874 PB/RVC. Incidence rates ranged from 15.5 to 17.5 N-MV per 1,000 days of mechanical ventilation, 5.0 to 6.7 UI-UP per 1,000 days of urethral probe and 4.0 to 4.7 PB/RVC per 1,000 days of vascular catheter. The predominant etiology in the N-MV was meticillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The UI-UP were originated predominantly by Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Enterococcus faecalis. A. baumannii and E. coli have increased their resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin or cefotaxime, respectively, in the last year controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated rates persist in all the infections controlled, without change in the etiology and increase of resistance of gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of colistin (colistimethate sodium) for therapy of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of colistin (colistimethate sodium) produced by a local pharmaceutical company in Thailand for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. METHODS: Patients hospitalized at Siriraj Hospital between January 2005 and April 2006, who had infections caused by MDR P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii, were enrolled in the study. Colistin (colistimethate sodium) at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/day was given intravenously in two divided doses. Primary outcomes were the clinical response and 30-day mortality; secondary outcomes were microbiological response and adverse events. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients infected with MDR P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were enrolled. Seventy-eight patients (71 with A. baumannii and seven with P. aeruginosa) received colistin, whereas 15 patients (12 with A. baumannii and three with P. aeruginosa) received other antibiotics. The mean age, gender, underlying conditions and severity of illness of the patients in both groups were not significantly different. In the colistin group, 63 patients (80.8%) had a favorable clinical response and 94.9% had a microbiological response. The overall mortality of the patients in the colistin group was 46.2% and that in the non-colistin group was 80%. Nephrotoxicity was found in 24 patients (30.8%) in the colistin group and 17 of them had predisposing factors contributing to their renal dysfunction. No neurotoxicity was observed among the 78 patients. CONCLUSION: Locally produced colistin appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of infections caused by MDR P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii in Thai adult patients.
TI  - Biofilm formation by multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium phage type DT104 and other pathogens.
AB  - The biofilm-forming capability of Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhimurium and Heidelberg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from humans, animal farms, and retail meat products was evaluated by using a microplate assay. The tested bacterial species showed interstrain variation in their capabilities to form biofilms. Strong biofilm-forming strains of S. enterica serotypes, E. coli O157: H7, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii were resistant to at least four of the tested antibiotics. To understand their potential in forming biofilms in food-processing environments, the strong biofilm formers grown in beef, turkey, and lettuce broths were further investigated on stainless steel and glass surfaces. Among the tested strains, Salmonella Typhimurium phage type DT104 (Salmonella Typhimurium DT104) isolated from retail beef formed the strongest biofilm on stainless steel and glass in beef and turkey broths. K. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes, and P. aeruginosa were also able to form strong biofilms on the tested surface materials. Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 developed a biofilm on stainless steel in beef and turkey broths through (i) initial attachment to the surface, (ii) formation of microcolonies, and (iii) biofilm maturation. These findings indicated that Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 alongwith other bacterial pathogens could be a source of cross-contamination during handling and processing of food.
TI  - [Analysis of antibiotics as a curative measure in four hospital units].
AB  - In order to analyse the methods of curative prescription of antibiotics in four units of hospitalization of the hospital Charles Nicolle of Tunis, a descriptive study of prescriptions was carried out during the first five months of year 2001. On the whole, 165 prescriptions delivered to patients were included in the study. The average age of the patients was 44 years, the sex ratio of 1.45 and the average duration of 15.1 days. Approximately two thirds of the initially probabilist prescriptions were not documented secondarily. Those secondarily documented (n = 51) were essentially related to nosocomial pneumonias and septicaemias (29 and 10 prescriptions). The two germs most frequently isolated during nosocomial pneumonias were Acinetobacter baumannii and, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 and 8 strains). Only imipenem, netilmicin and colistin remain active on A. baumannii. The bitherapy was the most used treatment (87.5%). It was generally an association beta-lactamin-aminosid (52.9%). The average cost of a documented prescription varied from 943,6 to 1184,9 TD (Tunisian Dinars) according as the prescription were secondarily documented or not.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Taiwan with an emphasis on Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bacterial infection is one of the major causes of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). This study was undertaken to investigate the microbiology of AECOPD. METHODS: Medical records from 494 episodes of AECOPD in patients admitted to the National Taiwan University Hospital from January 2000 to June 2004 were reviewed. Severity of COPD was classified according to the 2003 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guideline. RESULTS: Potential pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from patients in 328 (66.4%) episodes of AECOPD. The predominant bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (7.5%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (6.9%), Enterobacter species (6.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.1%). The incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 2.4%. Spirometry results obtained within 1 year of the exacerbation were available in 186 cases. K. pneumoniae was more frequently isolated in stage I COPD (39.1%) than stage II (16.6%), III (13.8%) and IV (9.4%). No glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli were isolated in stage I patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that P. aeruginosa (odds ratio (OR) 3.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-8.38), intubation (OR 14.81; 95% CI: 5.08-43.12) and age (OR 1.1; 95% CI: 1.03-1.17) were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are the most common sputum pathogens in hospitalized patients with AECOPD in Taiwan, with the former being more commonly isolated from mild COPD and the latter associated with poor clinical outcome. These results should be considered when deciding which antibiotics should initially be used to treat patients with AECOPD.
TI  - Management of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multiresistant bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The inappropriate choice of antibiotics (in nearly one third of episodes) is the most important risk factor for death. Traditionally, a narrow-spectrum drug was used first, and the most potent drugs were reserved for subsequent use. RECENT FINDINGS: As multidrug resistance increases in the intensive care unit in patients treated for nosocomial pneumonia, costs, mortality, and morbidity are rising. Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are frequently considered together, they have different virulence, risk factors and susceptibilities, requiring different antimicrobial choices. Assessment of clinical resolution should be differentiated in the presence of acute lung injury. In the absence of biochemical markers, oxygenation and core temperature should guide therapeutic decisions. SUMMARY: As ventilator-associated pneumonia increases, empiric therapy should be based on local pathogen etiology and antibiotic resistant patterns. A new approach to consider is to start with a high-dose, broad-spectrum antibiotic and then tailor the individual therapy based on microbiological results and clinical resolution. With the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics available in empiric therapy tailored after reassessment of the patient, there is hope for reducing costs, length of stay and mortality whereas the emergence of resistance will be minimized.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance surveillance: VIRA STUDY 2006].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two VIRA studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. METHODS: In February 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (365), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and Acinetobacter baumannii (92). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Susceptibility was determined with a broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Among the non-penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). Among MRSA, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli was 12.1%. Resistance of A. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: These results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas  aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae in Estonian intensive care units in comparison with European data.
AB  - This prospective cohort study was performed from April to December 2003 for the purpose of collecting a maximum of 50 non-duplicate isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae from each of 4 ICUs to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations. The most prevalent species were Enterobacteriaceae (13%), K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii (both 12%). 60% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to ampicillin/sulbactam and cefepime, 95% to meropenem and imipenem, and 75% to amikacin. 79% of P. aeruginosa strains were piperacillin/tazobactam, 58% ceftazidime, 81% meropenem, 72% imipenem, 69% ciprofloxacin and 97% amikacin susceptible. The susceptibility of K. pneumoniae to meropenem and imipenem was 99%, to ciprofloxacin was 91% and to amikacin was 98%. Gram-negative bacteria (especially K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii) were prevalent in our ICUs compared to other European studies. Carbapenem susceptibility of Estonian strains was higher, but P. aeruginosa sensitivity to ceftazidime was lower, compared to other EU countries.
TI  - [The clinical features of postoperative ventilator-associated pneumonia after lung surgery].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features of postoperative ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) after lung surgery. METHODS: Of 104 patients who had undergone lung surgery and been treated with ventilator in our surgical intensive care unit between January 2003 and March 2005, 35 patients met with the criteria of both VAP and postoperative pneumonia (POP), and 41 cases had no evidences of pneumonia. The clinical and laboratory data of all 76 cases were recorded and analyzed by a statistical software package (SPSS). RESULTS: The diagnosis of postoperative VAP was established clinically in 35 patients (46.1%), and etiologically in 33 cases. Compared to the patients without postoperative VAP, the patients with postoperative VAP had a significantly longer mean interval between intubation and operation [(2.7 +/- 2.9) days vs. (1.6 +/- 1.7) days, P = 0.039], a longer duration of mechanical ventilation [(32.2 +/- 37.7) days vs. (4.2 +/- 2.9) days, P < 0.001], and higher morbidity (20.0% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.013). There was a significant difference in mean duration of mechanical ventilation between the 15 cases of early-onset VAP and 20 cases of late-onset VAP (17 +/- 15 days vs. 43 +/- 46 days, P = 0.042). Among the initially detected pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus remains the most common Gram-positive coccus whereas Acinetobacter Baumannii took the place of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the top Gram-negative rod. CONCLUSION: Postoperative VAP after lung surgery has different clinical features from VAP in medical ICU.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
AB  - In the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus Candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. On the other hand, both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. According to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against S. aureus and E. faecalis with MIC values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by E. coli (2 microg/ml), K. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), A. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and B. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited C. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. However, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards PI-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (CPE).
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of class I integrons among Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from patients in Nanjing, China.
AB  - Class I integrons were detected in 40.8% (40/98) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and 52.8% (56/106) of Acinetobacter baumannii strains in the Nanjing area of China, including several cassette arrays not previously reported.
TI  - The diversity of definitions of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and pandrug-resistant (PDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Different definitions of the terms multidrug-resistant (MDR) and pandrug-resistant (PDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been used in the biomedical literature. The authors searched for relevant studies indexed in the PubMed database (01/2000-09/2005) to systematically examine the various definitions of MDR and PDR for these bacteria. Initially 107 retrieved relevant studies were reviewed. Ninety-two studies were further analysed, 50 of which focused on A. baumannii and 42 on P. aeruginosa. A considerable diversity of definitions of the terms MDR and PDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa was found. Of note, the term PDR was inappropriately used in all five studies that used it. The review reveals that various definitions have been used for the terms MDR and PDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, a fact that causes confusion to researchers and clinicians. The authors believe that at least a widely accepted definition for PDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa should be uniformly used worldwide.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of health care workers' pagers and the efficacy of various disinfecting agents.
AB  - Health care workers in our facility were surveyed, and their pagers were cultured before and after disinfection with various agents. All pagers were contaminated with bacteria, including the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella spp. and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Disinfection reduced bacterial contamination. No risk factors for pager contamination with pathogens were identified.
TI  - Patterns of antimicrobial resistance in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in Turkey.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported higher rates of antimicrobial resistance among isolates from intensive care units than among isolates from general patient-care areas. The aims of this study were to review the pathogens associated with nosocomial infections in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in Turkey and to summarize rates of antimicrobial resistance in the most common pathogens. The survey was conducted over a period of twelve months in a tertiary-care teaching hospital located in the south-eastern part of Turkey, Gaziantep. A total of 871 clinical specimens from 615 adult patients were collected. From 871 clinical specimens 771 bacterial and fungal isolates were identified. RESULTS: Most commonly isolated microorganisms were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.3%), Candida species (15%) and Staphylococcus aureus (12.9%). Among the Gram-negative microorganisms P. aeruginosa were mostly resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (71.3-98.1%), while Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant in all cases to piperacillin, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. Isolates of S. aureus were mostly resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, and methicillin (82-95%), whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci were 98.6% resistant to methicillin and in all cases resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline. CONCLUSION: In order to reduce the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in ICUs, monitoring and optimization of antimicrobial use in hospitals are strictly recommended. Therefore local resistance surveillance programs are of most value in developing appropriate therapeutic guidelines for specific infections and patient types.
TI  - The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection antimicrobial susceptibility program in Spain: a 5-year analysis.
AB  - The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection program is a global study providing in vitro surveillance data on antimicrobial susceptibility in centers prescribing meropenem. This study summarizes data on the activity of meropenem and 5 comparators against 4022 clinical isolates from 7 centers in Spain (1999-2003). Those bacteria intrinsically resistant to meropenem were excluded. Among Enterobacteriaceae, 100% of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., and Serratia spp. were susceptible to meropenem. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae susceptibilities to carbapenems were 100% and > or =98%, respectively. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae were 3.8% of isolates, and all of them were susceptible to meropenem. Ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli was around 20%. Meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were the most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Acinetobacter baumannii were 61-90% susceptible to carbapenems, but only 6-21% susceptible to ciprofloxacin. In this period, around 100% of oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci were susceptible to meropenem. There was no significant decrease in susceptibility to the carbapenems throughout the 5-year period. The clinical use of meropenem in 7 Spanish centers did not increase bacterial resistance to this agent in the microorganisms evaluated.
TI  - Bacteria recovered from patients admitted to a deployed U.S. military hospital in Baghdad, Iraq.
AB  - The predominant bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibilities were surveyed from a  deployed, military, tertiary care facility in Baghdad, Iraq, serving U.S. troops, coalition forces, and Iraqis, from August 2003 through July 2004. We included cultures of blood, wounds, sputum, and urine, for a total of 908 cultures; 176 of these were obtained from U.S. troops. The bacteria most commonly isolated from U.S. troops were coagulase-negative staphylococci, accounting for 34% of isolates, Staphylococcus aureus (26%), and streptococcal species (11%). The 732 cultures obtained from the predominantly Iraqi population were Klebsiella pneumoniae (13%), Acinetobacter baumannii (11%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%); coagulase-negative staphylococci represented 21% of these isolates. These differences in prevalence were all statistically significant, when compared in chi2 analyses (p < 0.05). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated broad resistance among the Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Impact of antibiotic use and prescribing policy in a Tunisian intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of local antibiotic policy in a Tunisian ICU. The predefined primary efficacy objectives were the decrease of antibiotic consumption, reduction of inappropriate antibiotic (ATB) use and antimicrobial resistance. DESIGN: This prospective intervention study lasted from January 2002 to December 2004. In the first study period or the baseline phase (from January to December 2002) we focused on physician education for ATB prescription practice. The second period concerned intervention (control of all ATB use). RESULTS: The number of infection episodes significantly decreased from 2002 to 2004; 198 infection episodes in 2002 (1.63+/-1.15 episodes/patient) versus 124 in 2003 (1.22+/-0.93) (P<0.0008) versus 121 in 2004 (1.23+/-0.8) (P1<0.0008). The number of ATB/prescription also significantly decreased from 1.85+/-1.3 in 2002 to 1.5+/-0.9 in 2003 (P=0.02) and 1.5+/-1.4 in 2004 (P1=0.05). Appropriateness of antibiotherapy improved during the intervention period: 65% in 2002 versus 86% in 2003 (P=0.0003) and 81% in 2004 (P1=0.02). The length of antibiotherapy in survivors was considerably reduced: 14.1+/-2.9 days in 2002 versus 11.9+/-1.2 days in 2003 (P<10(-5)) and 10.9+/-2.5 days in 2004 (P1<10(-5)) with a significant reduction of antibiotherapy cost and length of stay (20.4+/-9 days in 2002 versus 18.3+/-6 days in 2003 and 16.9+/-8 days in 2004; P=0.05; P1=0.02). There was a significant decrease of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae esbeta, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
TI  - Multiple-drug-resistant bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Prevalence, risk factors, and outcome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence, risk factors, and effect on outcome of multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, cohort study. SETTING: Thirty-bed medical intensive care unit (ICU) in a university hospital. METHODS: All chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with acute exacerbation who required intubation and mechanical ventilation for >48 hrs were eligible during a 4-yr period. Patients with pneumonia or other causes of acute respiratory failure were not eligible. In all patients, quantitative tracheal aspirate was performed at ICU admission (positive at 10 colony-forming units [cfu]/mL). MDR bacteria were defined as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime- or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli. All patients received empirical antibiotic treatment at ICU admission. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine variables associated with MDR bacteria and variables associated with ICU mortality. RESULTS: A total of 857 patients were included, and 304 bacteria were isolated (>/=10 cfu/mL) in 260 patients (30%), including 75 MDR bacteria (24%) in 69 patients (8%). When patients with MDR bacteria were compared with patients without MDR bacteria, previous antimicrobial treatment (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.2-4.7; p = .013) and previous intubation (OR, 31; 95% CI, 12-82; p < .001) were independently associated with MDR bacteria. When patients with bacteria other than MDR or patients with no bacteria were used as a reference group, these risk factors were still independently associated with MDR bacteria. Although ICU mortality rate was higher in patients with MDR bacteria than in patients without MDR bacteria (44% vs. 25%; p = .001; OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.8), MDR bacteria were not independently associated with ICU mortality. Inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment (88% vs. 5%; p = <.001; OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 3.8-12) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (23% vs. 5%; p = <.001; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1-1.8) rates were significantly higher in patients with MDR bacteria than in patients with bacteria other than MDR. Inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment was independently associated with increased ICU mortality (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 1.9-30; p = .003). CONCLUSION: MDR bacteria are common in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Previous antimicrobial treatment and previous intubation are independent risk factors for MDR bacteria. Although MDR bacteria are not independently associated with ICU mortality, inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment is an independent risk factor for ICU mortality in these patients. Further studies are needed to determine whether broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment is cost-effective in these patients.
TI  - Treatment options for multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - As a consequence of antibiotic overuse and misuse, nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria represent a physician's nightmare throughout the world. No newer antimicrobials active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the main multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen, are available or under investigation. The only exceptions are linezolid, some newer glycopeptides (dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin) and daptomycin (a lipopeptide), which are active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains, as well as tigecycline, a potent in vitro glycylcycline against MRSA, VRE, Acinetobacter baumannii and entended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)+ Enterobacteriaceae. Colistin, an antibiotic of the 1950s has been rediscovered by intensive care unit physicians for use against ESBL+ Enterobacteriaceae, as well as against multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates. Although success rates with colistin range between 50 and 73%, almost all studies are retrospective. Immunostimulation efforts against S. aureus are still under development. As antibiotic research and development stagnate, rational policies for prescribing existing antibiotics plus strict infection control are the current mainstay efforts for preventing and combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
TI  - Frequency and predictors of colonization of the respiratory tract by VIM-2-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients of a newly established intensive care unit.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the frequency and predictors of colonization of the respiratory tract by metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria in patients admitted to a newly established intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital. Specimens of tracheobronchial aspirates for microbiological studies were obtained every day for the first 3 days of the ICU stay and subsequently every third day for the rest of the ICU stay. PCR analysis and nucleotide sequencing were performed to identify bacteria that had MBL genes. Thirty-five patients (20 male, 15 female) were hospitalized during the initial 3 month period of functioning of the ICU. Colonization of the lower respiratory tract by Gram-negative bacteria was found in 29 of 35 patients (83 %) during the first 6-20 days (median 13 days) following admission to the ICU (13 patients with Acinetobacter baumannii, ten with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, three with Enterobacter aerogenes, two with Klebsiella pneumoniae and one with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). Six of 29 patients (21 %) colonized with Gram-negative bacteria had bla(VIM-2)-positive P. aeruginosa isolates; one of these patients developed clinical infection due to this micro-organism. Previous use of carbapenems (P=0.01) or other beta-lactams (P=0.03), as well as a stay in the ICU of >20 days (P<0.001), were associated with colonization with bla(VIM-2)-producing P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, colonization by Gram-negative bacteria of the respiratory tract of patients in this newly established ICU was common (83 %). Use of beta-lactams, including carbapenems, was associated with subsequent colonization of the respiratory tract with MBL-positive P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Investigation of serum resistance for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains].
AB  - Serum resistance is one of the major virulence factors of Gram negative bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the serum resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from various clinical samples (19 tracheal aspirates, 14 urine, 7 sputum, 7 wound and one peritoneal fluid specimens). Forty-eight P. aeuginosa and 48 A. baumannii strains were tested for human serum bactericidal effect by using Benge's method. Thirty-five (72.9%), 9 (18.7%), and 4 (8.3%) of P. aeruginosa strains were found to be resistant, intermediate sensitive and sensitive to serum, respectively. These rates were detected as 81.2% (39/48), 14.5% (7/48), and 4.1% (2/48) for A. baumannii strains, respectively. It can be concluded that, high serum resistance rates of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates might have an important role in the pathogenesis of infections of these bacteria.
TI  - [Does pre-incubation period affect detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii species with automatized BACTEC 9120 blood culture system?].
AB  - In this study, the effect of the pre-incubation period on detection of non-fermentative species in blood culture system was investigated. Different concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter strains were inoculated into BACTEC-9120 plus+Aerobic/F bottles and incubated for 0, 4, 8, 16 hours at 36 dgerees C and then were loaded to the system. Both P. aeruginosa and A.baumannii strains yielded positive signals within 24 hours after loading. In all preincubation periods, as the concentration of P. aeruginosa strains decreased, the detection time was increased. The higher the concentration of A.baumannii strains, is the longer the signalling time as the pre-incubation period is increased, whereas the lower the concentration of A. baumannii strains, is the shorter the signalling time as the preincubation period is increased. Our study indicated that the BACTEC-9120 blood culture system determined non-fermentative bacteria after a pre-incubation time of 16 hours.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of nosocomial gram negative pathogens: results from MYSTIC study in Hacettepe University Adult Hospital (2000-2004)].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram negative pathogens (n: 699) isolated from nosocomial infections in Hacettepe University Adult Hospital included in MYSTIC programme between 2000-2004 were determined by Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) using CLSI criteria. Of the total Escherichia coli (n: 179), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n: 168), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n: 179) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n: 173) isolates, 55% were from patients in inpatient clinics and 45% were from patients in intensive care units. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production rate of E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were 28% and 47%, respectively. All E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were found susceptible to carbapenems. The susceptibility of ESBL positive E. coli isolates to piperacillin+tazobactam was 76% and 65% to cefepime, 63% to ceftazidime, 56% to tobramycin, 24% to ciprofloxacin. For ESBL negative E. coli isolates, the susceptibility rates were found 95%, 92%, 84% and 58% for ceftazidime and tobramycin, cefepime, piperacillin+tazobactam and ciprofloxacin, respectively. The susceptibility rates of ESBL positive K. pneumoniae isolates to piperacillin+tazobactam was 55% and 51% to cefepime, 49% to ciprofloxacin, 45% to tobramycin, 42% to ceftazidime. For ESBL negative K. pneumoniae isolates, the susceptibility rates were determined as follows; 92% for cefepime, 87% for tobramycin, 70% for piperacillin+tazobactam, 62% for ceftazidime and 60% for ciprofloxacin. Of the P. aeruginosa isolates, 77% were multi-drug resistant with susceptibility rates to piperacillin+tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, meropenem and imipenem as 55%, 53%, 51% and 49%, respectively. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa isolates were 48% to ceftazidime, 41% to cefepime and 35% to tobramycin. Of the A.baumannii isolates, 67% were multi-drug resistant with higher susceptibility rates to meropenem (53%), imipenem (48%) and tobramycin (44%) compared to other antimicrobials cefepime (37%), ciprofloxacin (29%), piperacillin+tazobactam (26%) and ceftazidime (22%).
TI  - Influence of culture site-specific MIC distributions on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of piperacillin/tazobactam and piperacillin: a data analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Investigators who perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling with Monte Carlo simulation have historically not stratified microbiological data by culture site. This lack of stratification might be problematic if susceptibility patterns differ among sites and might lead to differences in PK-PD. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the PK-PD of 2 antimicrobial regimens against 5 gram-negative bacterial species form 3 culture sites. METHODS: This data analysis was performed at the Department of Pharmacology, The University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas. Blood, pulmonary (ie, bronchial, endotracheal, lung, respiratory, sputum, and tracheal secretions), and wound distributions of MICs were extracted from the 2002 Intensive Care Unit Surveillance System database. Bacteria included Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The PK properties of piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g every 4 hours) and piperacillin (3 g every 4 hours) were obtained from studies in healthy volunteers. Monte Carlo simulation was used in 10,000 patients for each antimicrobial-bacteria-culture site combination. The cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for a free percentage time above the MIC of > or =50% was determined for each combination, and a clinically significant difference was defined a priori as > or =10%. RESULTS: Data from 2408 pulmonary, 490 blood, and 242 wound isolates were included. For piperacillin/tazobactam, the CFR varied <10% by culture site in all 5 bacterial species. Site-specific differences were noted in MIC50 for piperacillin versus E cloacae and E coli and MIC90 for piperacillin/tazobactam versus K pneumoniae and P aeruginosa. Likewise, for piperacillin, the CFR was similar among the 3 culture sites for P aeruginosa. However, the CFR for piperacillin varied by > or =10% for A baumannii (blood > wound), E cloacae (pulmonary > blood), E coli (pulmonary and blood > wound), and K pneumoniae (wound > blood). CONCLUSIONS: The PK-PD models based on PK properties found in healthy humans and site-specific MIC distributions in this study suggest that for piperacillin, culture-site differences subsequently resulted in CFR differences that exceeded a predetermined level of clinical significance. Furthermore, these data suggest that traditional reporting strategies for microbiological data (ie, MIC50 and MIC90) might fail to adequately characterize the MIC population.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefepime combined with sulbactam against clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of cefepime combined with sulbactam against carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates of Acinetobacter spp. The checkerboard method was used to determine whether combinations act synergistically against these strains. Twenty-three Acinetobacter baumannii and one Acinetobacter junii found to be carbapenem resistant were included in the study. The susceptibility results for cefepime and sulbactam were interpreted according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were used as quality control strains. The combination of cefepime and sulbactam demonstrated the following interactions: 33.3% (8/24) synergism; 58.3% (14/24) partial synergism; 4.2% (1/24) additive; 4.2% (1/24) indifference; and no antagonism (minimum and maximum fractional inhibitory concentration index 0.25 and 1.5, respectively). According to our in vitro study results, combinations of cefepime with sulbactam have moderate synergistic activity against some carbapenem-resistant strains of Acinetobacter spp., which could be beneficial for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter spp.
TI  - Colistin as a salvage therapy for nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria in the ICU.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of systemic colistin therapy in the treatment of nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to study related adverse events. We prospectively studied 78 infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii or P. aeruginosa that were treated with colistin. The sites of infection were pulmonary infection (78.2%), urinary tract infection (7.7%), primary bloodstream infection (11.5%) and meningitis (2.6%). The mean daily dose of colistin was 5.5+/-1.1 MU/day (range 2-9 MU/day) and the mean duration of colistin therapy was 9.3+/-3.8 days (range 5-21 days). A favourable clinical response to colistin occurred in 60 cases (76.9%). Renal failure occurred in only seven cases. We conclude that colistin can be a safe and effective salvage therapeutic option for nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Using local microbiologic data to develop institution-specific guidelines for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: While current guidelines recommend consideration of local microbiologic data when selecting empiric treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), few specifics of how to do this have been offered. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of HAP pathogens in 111 consecutive patients who acquired HAP during July to December 2004 and had a corresponding positive culture finding for a bacterial pathogen. These data were used to develop institution-specific guidelines. RESULTS: The most common bacteria identified were Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were associated with 38%, 25%, and 19% of pneumonias, respectively. Susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime was 80% and 81%, respectively. The isolation of organisms resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime was significantly more frequent in patients who had been hospitalized > or = 10 days. Of Gram-negative isolates resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime, ciprofloxacin was active against < 10%, while amikacin was active against > 80%. New treatment guidelines were developed that divided the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America "late onset/risk of multidrug-resistant pathogens" group of patients into two subcategories: "early-late" pneumonias (< 10 days of hospitalization) and "late-late" pneumonias (> or = 10 days of hospitalization). Guideline-directed treatment regimens would be predicted to provide adequate initial therapy for > 90% of late-onset pneumonias at our institution. CONCLUSIONS: Current guidelines suggest adding either an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone to beta-lactam therapy for empiric Gram-negative coverage. However, in our institution, adding ciprofloxacin would not appreciably enhance the likelihood of providing initial appropriate antibiotic coverage. This underscores the importance of employing a systematic analysis of local data when developing treatment guidelines.
TI  - Effectiveness and nephrotoxicity of intravenous colistin for treatment of patients with infections due to polymyxin-only-susceptible (POS) gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The prospective case series study presented here was conducted to assess the outcome of patients with infections caused by polymyxin-only-susceptible (POS) gram-negative bacteria managed with intravenous colistin. Between July 2003 and April 2005 a total of 27 patients were infected with a POS gram-negative bacterium and received intravenous colistin at a dose of 2 million international units (MIU) (160 mg or 66.7 mg colistin base) every 8 h for a mean (+/-SD) duration of 13.9 (+/-7.5) days. Nine patients had ventilator-associated pneumonia and received, in addition to the intravenous colistin therapy, 1 MIU (80 mg or 33.3 mg colistin base) aerosolized colistin every 12 h for a mean (+/-SD) duration of 13 (+/-6.5) days. The predominant pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 17) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12); in two patients both pathogens were isolated from one clinical specimen. In-hospital mortality and clinical response were 15% and 85%, respectively. Colistin-associated nephrotoxicity was observed in two of the 27 patients. POS gram-negative pathogens represent a major threat for hospitalized patients. Colistin appears to be an effective and safe treatment, even in patients with severe underlying diseases.
TI  - Impact of ceftazidime restriction on gram-negative bacterial resistance in an intensive care unit.
AB  - The present study included three periods: (1) a 12-month pre-restriction and control period in 2001; (2) a 12-month restriction period with reduced ceftazidime prescribing in favor of piperacillin-tazobactam (2002); (3) and a 24 month post-restriction period (2003-2004). Note that, for results, P represents the difference between 2002 and 2001; P', the difference between 2003 and 2001; and P'', the difference between 2004 and 2001. No changes in hygiene practices were observed during these three periods. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of reducing ceftazidime use in an intensive care unit (ICU) upon Gram-negative bacterial resistance, particularly as regards Pseudomonas aeruginosa. During the three periods of the study, patients were similar concerning age, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPSII), the site of nosocomial infection, and the requirements for mechanical ventilation (75% in 2001, 76% in 2002, 74% in 2003, and 85% in 2004). The most commonly isolated pathogens were P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacteriaceae. The use of ceftazidime decreased significantly from 12.6% in 2001 to 9% in 2002, to 3% in 2003 (P' = 0.0009), and 2.6% in 2004 (P'' = 0.0001) in favor of piperacillin-tazobactam (0% 2001 to 3.7% in 2003; P' = 0.002; and 5% in 2004; P'' = 0.0001). Simultaneously, we observed a significant decrease in isolates of P. aeruginosa resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam (P = 0.03; P' = 0.004; P'' = 0.009), and those resistant to imipenem in 2003 (P' = 0.008). We also noted a significant decrease in A. baumannii isolates resistant to ceftazidime (P' = 0.01; P'' = 0.0004) and those resistant to imipenem in both 2002 and 2004 (P = 0.03; P'' = 0.04), and a considerable decrease in isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing expanded spectrum betalactamase (ESBL) in 2003 and 2004 (P' = 0.04; P'' = 6.10(-5)). In contrast, we noted an increase in penicillinase-producing isolates of K. pneumoniae, from 6% in 2001 to 16% in 2002 (p = 0.01), 20% in 2003 (P' = 0.001), and 32% in 2004 (P'' = 10(-6)). We concluded that restriction of ceftazidime use was demonstrated to be efficient in reducing antimicrobial resistance, especially to K. pneumoniae ESBL.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic rationale for cefepime dosing regimens in intensive care units.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: (i) To develop a population pharmacokinetics (PK) model for cefepime  in patients in intensive care units (ICUs). (ii) To assess the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile of various cefepime dosing regimens and to assess their expected probability of target attainment (=PTA expectation value) against common ICU pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. METHODS: Thirteen ICU patients received cefepime 2 g 12 hourly intravenous (3 min). Twelve blood samples were taken on two occasions: (i) immediately after initial dose; and (ii) between days 3 and 6 after starting therapy. Population PK models were developed using NONMEM. Based on the final covariate model, Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken (n=1000) to simulate free-drug concentrations of cefepime for two administration methods: (i) intermittent bolus administration (IBA); and (ii) continuous infusion (CI). Concentration-time profiles were evaluated by the probability of achieving free-drug concentration above the MIC for >65% of the dosing interval. Finally, using local MIC distributions of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii the PTA expectation values for each dosing administration method were evaluated. RESULTS: A three-compartment model with zero-order input best described the concentration-time data. The PTA expectation values for E. coli and K. pneumoniae were >90% in all CI doses but only when administered as 1 g every 6 h and higher daily doses for IBA. For the current treatment protocol, 2 g every 12 h, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii achieved target concentrations of only 54% and 28%, respectively. For P. aeruginosa, a CI of at least 4 g/day was required to achieve a PTA expectation value>90% while for A. baumannii a 6 g/day CI only achieved a PTA expectation value of 75%. CONCLUSIONS: When given as IBA or CI for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, cefepime should be successful in achieving the bactericidal target. For P. aeruginosa higher doses of cefepime (>4 g/day) are required to achieve the required PTA expectation value. Cefepime fails to achieve the bactericidal target even when administered at high doses, e.g. 6 g/day, for A. baumannii.
TI  - Colistin: the re-emerging antibiotic for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  - Increasing multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, presents a critical problem. Limited therapeutic options have forced infectious disease clinicians and microbiologists to reappraise the clinical application of colistin, a polymyxin antibiotic discovered more than 50 years ago. We summarise recent progress in understanding the complex chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of colistin, the interplay between these three aspects, and their effect on the clinical use of this important antibiotic. Recent clinical findings are reviewed, focusing on evaluation of efficacy, emerging resistance, potential toxicities, and combination therapy. In the battle against rapidly emerging bacterial resistance we can no longer rely entirely on the discovery of new antibiotics; we must also pursue rational approaches to the use of older antibiotics such as colistin.
TI  - Fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar--a differential medium for enteric bacteria.
AB  - Fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar (FEBLA), a new differential medium for enteric bacteria was developed and evaluated for its ability to grow and differentiate lactose fermenters (LF) from non-lactose fermenters (NLF) in comparison with MacConkeys agar. Performance of FEBLA was at par with the latter. On FEBLA medium, the contrast between LF and NLF colonies was pronounced and Klebsiella pneumoniae produced more mucoid colonies than on MacConkeys agar (Hi Media). Unlike MacConkeys agar, a 24 h culture of K. pneumoniae cells on FEBLA were longer and thicker with abundant capsular material around the bacilli. Escherichia coli produced long and thick cells but only after 48h. No change in cell morphology was evident with regard to Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi A, Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter koseri and Acinetobacter baumannii. Performance of the medium was controlled using E. coli and S. flexneri. FEBLA is simple, cost effective and may be a suitable alternative in the preliminary identification of enteric bacteria.
TI  - Microbiology of postoperative infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical infections, accounting for approximately one quarter of all  nosocomial infections, contribute to longer hospital stays and higher medical costs. Clinical failure of antibiotic treatment often is associated with increasing drug resistance. METHODS: Non-duplicated microbial isolates obtained at our institution from surgical patients were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the Sceptor system in 2001-2002 and the Phoenix system in 2003-2005. Epidemiologic data were extracted using Epicenter and Powerlab. During selected periods, genetic and biochemical characterization was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, colony blot hybridization, gene amplification and sequencing, isoelectric focusing, and enzyme kinetics. RESULTS: The specimens were most commonly isolated from infections at surgical sites (24.0%), the urinary tract (19.0%), and blood stream (10.6%). Isolates of Escherichia coli showed an increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, whereas the prevalence of resistant Staphylococcus aureus generally declined. Highly aggressive multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were widespread, although colistin remained effective in 100% of cases. A significant increase was seen in infections attributable to S. epidermidis and Candida albicans. The overall number of Enterobacteriaceae carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased continuously, and new resistance traits emerged. It appeared that the TEM-92 determinant moved from Enterobacteriaceae to nonfermenting gram-negative rods such as Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: The number and type of antimicrobial-resistance determinants are increasing.
TI  - Novel antibiotic combinations against infections with almost completely resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species.
AB  - For infections with antibiotic-susceptible strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most studies have suggested that combination therapy, usually with a beta -lactam antibiotic plus an aminoglycoside, is preferable for patients with bacteremia and neutropenia. Against infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii isolates that are resistant to all antibiotics except the polymyxins, several novel antibiotic combinations demonstrate increased activity in vitro compared with that of any single agent. Whether these combinations yield outcomes that are improved over those seen with a polymyxin or other agent alone remains to be determined. However, against infections with species resistant to all antibiotics, including polymyxins, novel combinations are the only remaining therapeutic option.
TI  - Parenteral and inhaled colistin for treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - The spectrum of available therapeutic options has become drastically narrowed in  recent years, particularly for nosocomial multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens. This therapeutic void has created a resurgence of interest in colistin. In 5 published series since 1999, clinical response rates for pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii treated with intravenous colistin have ranged from 25% to 62%, despite high severity of illness at baseline. De novo nephrotoxicity was observed in 8%-36% of patients, despite close attention to both appropriate dosing and duration of treatment. Neurotoxicity, which was commonly described in the old colistin era, has been exceedingly rare in recent experience. Aerosolized therapy as an adjunct to systemic treatment appears promising, but the current published data are much too limited to allow determination of the incremental benefit of the addition of aerosolized treatment to systemic treatment. Colistin is a reasonably safe last-line therapeutic alternative for pneumonia due to multi- or panresistant P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii.
TI  - Antibiotic regimens and intestinal colonization with antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The intestinal tract provides an important reservoir for antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli, including Enterobacteriaceae species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Selective pressure exerted by antibiotics plays a crucial role in the emergence and dissemination of these pathogens. Many classes of antibiotics may promote intestinal colonization by health care-associated gram-negative bacilli, because the organisms are often multidrug resistant. Antibiotics may inhibit colonization by gram-negative pathogens that remain susceptible, but the benefits of this effect are often limited because of the emergence of resistance. Antibiotic formulary alterations and standard infection control measures have been effective in controlling outbreaks of colonization and infection with antibiotic-resistant gram-negative pathogens. Additional research is needed to clarify the role of strategies such as selective decontamination of the digestive tract and decontamination of environmental surfaces and of patients' skin and wounds.
TI  - What infection control interventions should be undertaken to control multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria?
AB  - Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria are an emerging problem. The present article addresses 2 relevant questions: (1) should active surveillance be performed to identify patients colonized with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, and (2) should contact isolation precautions be taken with patients colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria? Data and variables that are needed to scientifically answer these questions are reviewed, as are existing data on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species in particular), and Acinetobacter baumannii.
TI  - Challenges in identifying new antimicrobial agents effective for treating infections with Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are gram-negative pathogens that target immunocompromised patients. They express a variety of determinants that confer resistance to a broad array of antimicrobial agents. Mechanisms of resistance include impaired entry through the bacterial outer membrane, production of antibiotic-modifying enzymes, active efflux, and target mutations that reduce antimicrobial affinity. It has been a challenge to identify new agents that have activity against the more resistant variants of these species. Doripenem is a carbapenem in phase 3 trials that has excellent activity against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. However, it lacks activity against strains that express resistance to the currently available carbapenems. Tigecycline is a newly licensed glycylcycline that lacks activity against P. aeruginosa but has encouraging activity against many A. baumannii isolates. Resistance to tigecycline can emerge during therapy, however, and is due to expression of multidrug efflux pumps.
TI  - Bacillus spp. among hospitalized patients with haematological malignancies: clinical features, epidemics and outcomes.
AB  - Between April 2000 and May 2005, 350 bacteraemic episodes occurred among patients treated in our haematology unit. Two hundred and twenty-eight of these episodes were caused by Gram-positive pathogens, most commonly coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus. One hundred and twenty-two episodes were due to Gram-negative pathogens, with a predominance of Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacillus bacteraemias constituted 12 of these episodes occurring in 12 patients, and accounted for 3.4% of all bacteraemic episodes. Of the 12 strains evaluated, seven were Bacillus licheniformis, three were Bacillus cereus and two were Bacillus pumilus. Seven episodes presented with bloodstream infection, three with pneumonia, one with severe abdominal pain and deterioration of liver function, and one with a catheter-related bloodstream infection. B. licheniformis was isolated from five patients who had been hospitalized at the same time. This outbreak was related to non-sterile cotton wool used during skin disinfection. B. cereus and B. licheniformis isolates were susceptible to cefepime, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and vancomycin, but B. pumilus isolates were resistant to all antibiotics except for quinolones and vancomycin. Two deaths were observed. In conclusion, Bacillus spp. may cause serious infections, diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, and high morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological malignancies. Both B. cereus and B. licheniformis may be among the 'new' Gram-positive pathogens to cause serious infection in patients with neutropenia.
TI  - [Rupture of venous bypass graft associated to infection of multiresistant bacteria].
AB  - We report two cases of severe trauma of the upper limb requiring arterial revascularization. A brachio-brachial inverted saphenous bypass graft was done in both cases. Graft rupture attributed to local infection occurred at fourth post-operative week. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the surgical wound in the first case and Acinetobacter baumanni in the second. The first case ended up with arm amputation mostly owing to extensive destruction of soft tissue, the patient being discharged home without any other sequel. In the second case the patient was successfully resuscitated after cardiopulmonary arrest, secondary to hemorrhagic shock. He underwent new brachio-brachial venous bypass graft avoiding the contaminated area. Irreversible ischemic signs plus growing overt infection led to arm amputation later on. This patient developed multi-organ failure and died by the fifth post-operative week. Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are gram-negative bacilli widely present in hospital environment. Most of them are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Their association with vascular conduit infections might have dreadful consequences as it happened in these cases.
TI  - [Nosocomial pneumonia due to Acinetobacter baumannii].
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii is a significant cause of nosocomial pneumonia, especially late ventilator-associated pneumonia. In Spain, A. baumannii is the third leading pathogen after Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Risk factors for pneumonia due to A. baumannii are head injury, neurosurgery, acute respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration, and previous antibiotic therapy. Definitive diagnosis requires respiratory samples and invasive techniques with quantitative cultures to differentiate true infections from simple colonizations. The crude mortality of patients with ventilator-associated A. baumannii pneumonia is high, although the attributable mortality is controversial. Adequate empirical antimicrobial therapy of A. baumannii pneumonia is a protective factor, even though the therapeutic options are often limited. The treatment of choice is imipenem and sulbactam may be considered an acceptable alternative. Nowadays, colistin is the treatment of choice in A. baumannii pneumonia caused by panresistant strains. The associations of imipenem and rifampin or imipenem and sulbactam may be acceptable alternatives to colistin in infections caused by these strains. Surveillance measures are essential to eradicate this multidrug-resistant pathogen in outbreaks and reduce the number of episodes in endemic situations. Although these measures are important throughout the hospital, intensive care units are especially high-risk areas.
TI  - [Pathogenesis and environmental factors in ventilator-associated pneumonia].
AB  - Respiratory infections in intubated patients can derive from endogenous or exogenous sources. The major route for acquiring endemic ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is oropharyngeal colonization by endogenous flora and leakage of contaminated secretions into the lower respiratory tract. However, a not inconsiderable percentage of VAP results from exogenous nosocomial colonization, especially pneumonias caused by resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as by Legionella spp or filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus. This article reviews the pathogenesis of VAP and the role of the intensive care environment as a source of pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - [Prevalence of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates resistant to imipenem by production of metallo-beta-lactamase].
AB  - Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) are enzymes produced by Gram-negative bacilli such  as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. These enzymes make these isolates resistant to imipenem. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of this resistance mechanism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains identified in the bacteriology laboratory of the Rabat Ibn Sina teaching hospital, Morocco. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Screening for MBL was systematic in all resistant strains and/or strains with decreased sensitivity to imipenem, according to Dongeun Yong et al.'s method, using a sterilized solution of EDTA 0.5 M pH 8. RESULTS: Eighty-five bacterial strains (48 P. aeruginosa and 37 A. baumannii) were identified 23% (11) and 57% (21) of which were respectively resistant to the imipenem. The prevalence of MbetaL producing strains was 27% for P. aeruginosa and 38% for A. baumannii. CONCLUSION: These results show that the frequency of these strains is increases in our hospital and that their emergence represents a serious therapeutic and epidemiological problem. This means that we need to implement the supervision of hospital microbial environment and strictly apply hygiene measures.
TI  - Results of gastroscope bacterial decontamination by enzymatic detergent compared  to chlorhexidine.
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy of enzymatic detergent with chlorhexidine for gastroscope bacterial decontamination. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled study was undertaken to evaluate the ability of these 2 agents to achieve high level disinfection in a gastroscope. A total of 260 samples were collected from 5 different gastroscopes. Manual cleaning was done for 10 min with these 2 agents separately (n = 130 each). Then all specimens underwent 2% glutaraldehyde soaking for 20 min. After 70% alcohol was rinsed, sterile normal saline was flushed into each gastroscope channel and 40 mL of sample was collected. The sample was sent for aerobic bacterial culture after membrane was filtered. A colony count greater than 200 cfu/mL was considered significant. RESULTS: The positive culture rate was 4.6% in the enzymatic detergent arm and 3.1% in the chlorhexidine arm. Pseudomonas species were the main organism detected from both groups (60%). Multiple organisms were found from 4 specimens (enzymatic detergent arm = 1, chlorhexidine arm = 3). CONCLUSION: The contamination rate of both types of cleaning solution is equivalent.
TI  - Comparison of antimicrobial effects of dexmedetomidine and etomidate-lipuro with  those of propofol and midazolam.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of dexmedetomidine and etomidate-lipuro, and to compare these effects with those of midazolam and propofol on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli ( E. coli ESBL). METHODS: All hypnotic dilutions were exposed to micro-organisms for 0, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min at room temperature in vitro. The inoculums taken from diluted suspensions were re-inoculated on blood agar and incubated for 18-24 h at 35 degrees C after which a count of the colonies was compared. RESULTS: Midazolam reduced the viable cells of S. aureus at 30, 60, 120 and 240 min, and also completely inhibited the growth of E. coli, P. aeroginosa, A. baumannii and E. coli ESBL. Dexmedetomidine, etomidate-lipuro and propofol, however, did not inhibit any of the micro-organisms tested. CONCLUSION: In vitro, midazolam had an antimicrobial effect on E. coli, P. aeroginosa, A. baumannii and E. coli ESBL. Like propofol and dexmedetomidine, etomidate-lipuro had no antimicrobial effect on any of the micro-organisms tested.
TI  - Evaluation of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase for the identification of nonfermenting Gram-negative rods.
AB  - To evaluate the activity of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (PYR) for the differentiation and identification of nonfermenting gram negative rods (NFGNR), 293 isolates were tested. A 24 h culture of each test organism was prepared. From this a 108-109 cfu/mL suspension was added to 0.25 mL of sterile physiologic solution. A PYR disk was then added and the test was incubated for 30 minutes at 35-37 degrees C, at environmental atmosphere. Reading was done by adding 1 drop of cinnamaldehyde reagent. Strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter haemolyticus, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bergeyella zoohelcum, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella hinzii, Brevundimonas diminuta, Brevundimonas vesicularis, Brucella ovis, Brucella spp., Brucella suis, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella lacunata, Moraxella nonliquefaciens, Moraxella osloensis, Oligella ureolytica, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas mendocina, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas Vb3, Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were PYR negative. On the other hand Achromobacter piechaudii, Achromobacter denitrificans, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia gladioli, Chryseobacterium gleum-indologenes, Comamonas testosroni, Cupriavidus pauculus, Delftia acidovorans, Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, Myroides spp., Ochrobactrum anthropi, Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, Ralstonia pickettii, Rhizobium radiobacter, Shewanella spp., Sphingobacterium multivorum, Sphingobacterium spiritivorum, and Weeksella virosa were PYR positive. Finally, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Roseomonas spp., and Sphingomonas paucimobilis-parapaucimobilis were PYR variable. PYR testing should be considered as a useful tool to facilitate the identification of NFGNR.
TI  - Risk factors for the isolation of multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a systematic review of the literature.
AB  - An understanding of the epidemiology of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter  baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections is necessary in order to develop strategies to curtail their spread. For this purpose, the evidence linking the isolation of MDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa with specific risk factors was evaluated. PubMed was searched for the 20-year period from September 1985 to September 2005, and eligible studies were considered to be those that: (1) linked the isolation of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa with specific risk factors; (2) described the characteristics of the affected patients in detail; and (3) provided data on the antibiotic resistance profile of the isolated micro-organisms. Fifty-five studies were found referring to A. baumannii (28 with case-control methodology and 27 outbreak investigations without case-control methodology), and 42 studies were found referring to P. aeruginosa (25 with case-control methodology and 17 outbreak investigations without case-control methodology). Although heterogeneous study designs and investigated risk factors limited this analysis, it was concluded that acquisition and spread of these micro-organisms appear to be related to a large number of variables. Among the most important were deficiencies in the implementation of infection control guidelines and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Use of carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins appear to be related to the development of an MDR phenotype by A. baumannii, while carbapenems and fluoroquinolones are implicated in MDR P. aeruginosa. The diversity of risk factors associated with the development of MDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa suggests that a separate outbreak investigation should be performed in each hospital setting. The development of innovative control strategies is needed in order to limit the spread of these pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activities of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against bacterial pathogens isolated from Intensive Care Units in Taiwan: SMART 2004 programme data.
AB  - We investigated the in vitro activity of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against Gram-negative bacterial isolates from Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in Taiwan. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 1030 bacterial isolates recovered from ICUs of nine major teaching hospitals was performed using the agar dilution method. Sulbactam was added to piperacillin either at a fixed sulbactam concentration of 4 mg/L and 8 mg/L or at a piperacillin:sulbactam ratio of 2:1 and 4:1. Piperacillin/sulbactam at a ratio of 2:1 or a fixed 8 mg/L concentration of sulbactam had better activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens than other piperacillin/sulbactam formulations. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin/sulbactam (2:1 or 4:1 ratios) had MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) of 64 mg/L (>90% susceptibility) compared with 64 mg/L for cefoperazone/sulbactam (68% susceptibility) and 128 mg/L for piperacillin/tazobactam (82% susceptibility). For Acinetobacter baumannii, both piperacillin/sulbactam (either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/L sulbactam) and cefoperazone/sulbactam were the most potent agents. Adding sulbactam to piperacillin resulted in increased susceptibility rates among piperacillin-resistant P. aeruginosa (53-57% in either 2:1 or 4:1 ratios) and A. baumannii (38-46% in either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/L concentration of sulbactam) isolates. Results of susceptibility tests with piperacillin/sulbactam are dependent on the method used. Piperacillin/sulbactam combinations possessed better in vitro activities than piperacillin alone or piperacillin/tazobactam against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.
TI  - Resistance in nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria: multidrug resistance to the maximum.
AB  - Nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria pose a particular difficulty for the healthcare community because they represent the problem of multidrug resistance to the maximum. Important members of the group in the United States include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Burkholderia cepacia. These organisms are niche pathogens that primarily cause opportunistic healthcare-associated infections in patients who are critically ill or immunocompromised. Multidrug resistance is common and increasing among gram-negative nonfermenters, and a number of strains have now been identified that exhibit resistance to essentially all commonly used antibiotics, including antipseudomonal penicillins and cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and carbapenems. Polymyxins are the remaining antibiotic drug class with fairly consistent activity against multidrug-resistant strains of P aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp, and S maltophilia. However, most multidrug-resistant B cepacia are not susceptible to polymyxins, and systemic polymyxins carry the risk of nephrotoxicity for all patients treated with these agents, the elderly in particular. A variety of resistance mechanisms have been identified in P aeruginosa and other gram-negative nonfermenters, including enzyme production, overexpression of efflux pumps, porin deficiencies, and target-site alterations. Multiple resistance genes frequently coexist in the same organism. Multidrug resistance in gram-negative nonfermenters makes treatment of infections caused by these pathogens both difficult and expensive. Improved methods for susceptibility testing are needed when dealing with these organisms, including emerging strains expressing metallo-beta-lactamases. Improved antibiotic stewardship and infection-control measures will be needed to prevent or slow the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant, nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli in the healthcare setting.
TI  - The use of intravenous and aerosolized polymyxins for the treatment of infections in critically ill patients: a review of the recent literature.
AB  - Intravenous and aerosolized polymyxins are being used increasingly, especially in the critical care setting, for treating patients with infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, mainly Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recent literature suggests that intravenous colistin and polymyxin B have acceptable effectiveness for the treatment of patients with bacteremia, as well as infections of various systems and organs, including pneumonia, bacteremia, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infections. Although data from recent studies have suggested that the toxicity of intravenous polymyxins is probably less than reported in the older literature, caution should be taken to monitor the renal function of patients who receive these antibiotics.
TI  - The comparison of susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative invasive and non-invasive pathogens in Estonian hospitals.
AB  - A total of 560 invasive and 1062 non-invasive isolates were collected. The antimicrobial susceptibility of invasive versus non-invasive Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were evaluated using the E-tests. The equal domination of Gram-negative among both invasive and non-invasive pathogens was estimated in our study if contaminants were excluded. The emergence trend of Gram-positive microbes especially of coagulase negative staphylococci may be proved only after application of exclusive algorithms. Due to similar susceptibility, the data of non-invasive Gram-negative pathogens can be useful to predict resistance of invasive ones. Also, the surveillance of invasive pathogens provides useful information about the general susceptibility of pathogens.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of phenotypically extended spectrum beta-lactamase  producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates].
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibilities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains that were identified as producers of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) phenotypically. Fifty three P. aeruginosa and 53 A. baumannii strains that were isolated from patients with hospital infections followed-up by Infectious Diseases Unit of Hacettepe University Adult Hospital in 2002-2004, were included in the study. The susceptibilities of the isolates to ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem and meropenem were determined by Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) method. The susceptibility rates of A. baumannii isolates against tobramycin and carbapenem group were 54.7% and 49.1%, respectively; whereas for the rest of the antimicrobial agents tested, these rates were lower than 25 percent. The susceptibility rates of P. aeruginosa isolates against ciprofloxacin, carbapenem group, piperacillin-tazobactam and tobramycin differed between 35-38 percent. Of the P. aeruginosa isolates, 37.5%, and of the A. baumannii isolates 37.7% were resistant against imipenem/meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin and tobramycin simultaneously. As a result, phenotypically ESBL producing P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates were found highly resistant not only against the third and fourth generation cephalosporins, but also to the antibiotics currently used in the therapy including carbapenemes.
TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of catheter-related infections in paediatric oncology: an update.
AB  - Otherwise unexplained clinical signs of infection in patients with long-term tunnelled or totally implanted central venous access devices (CVADs) are suspected to be CVAD-associated. Diagnostic methods include catheter swabs, blood cultures and cultures of the catheter tip or port reservoir. In the case of a suspected CVAD-related bloodstream infection in paediatric oncology patients, in-situ treatment without prompt removal of the device can be attempted. Removal of the CVAD should be considered if bacteraemia persists or relapses > or = 72 h after the initiation of (in-vitro effective) antibacterial therapy administered through the line. Timely removal of the device is also recommended if the patient suffers from a complicated infection, or if Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Candida spp. are isolated from blood cultures. Duration of therapy depends on the immunological recovery of the patient, the pathogen isolated and the presence of related complications, such as thrombosis, pneumonia, endocarditis and osteomyelitis. Antibiotic lock techniques in addition to systemic treatment are beneficial for Gram-positive infections. Although prospectively controlled studies are lacking, the concomitant use of urokinase locks and taurolidine secondary prophylaxis seem to favour catheter salvage.
TI  - Pasteurization is effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence and rapid spread of multidrug-resistant isolates causing nosocomial infections, particularly pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, pandrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are of great concern worldwide. METHODS: This study investigated the efficacy of pasteurization against contamination of culture tubes and plastic bags by the above 4 important multidrug-resistant bacteria. A 5-mL bacterial suspension with approximately 10(5) and 10(9) cfu/mL of each organism was inoculated into 3 sets of plastic bags and culture tubes and subjected to pasteurization in a washer at 75 degrees C for 30 minutes. RESULTS: A nearly total eradication was found after pasteurization of these 4 drug-resistant pathogens. CONCLUSION: Pasteurization was highly effective against drug-resistant bacteria. Strict adherence to appropriate infection control management for respiratory circuits is important for reducing the spread of drug-resistant bacteria among ventilator-assisted patients.
TI  - Broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, toxicologic assessment, and materials compatibility of a new generation of accelerated hydrogen peroxide-based environmental surface disinfectant.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns on human and environmental safety and label claims of many microbicides point to the need for safer, faster acting, and broad-spectrum substitutes. ACCEL TB, a 0.5% accelerated H(2)O(2) (AHP)-based disinfectant described here, is a potential candidate. METHODS: ACCEL TB was tested for its broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, safety and materials compatibility using internationally accepted protocols. Activity against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella choleraesuis) was tested with the AOAC use-dilution method and the first tier of a quantitative carrier test (QCT-1). Mycobactericidal activity was tested against Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium terrae using a quantitative suspension test (QST) and QCT-1, respectively. Fungicidal activity (Trichophyton mentagrophytes) was determined with the AOAC test and QCT-1. Activity against several enveloped and nonenveloped viruses was evaluated using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method No. E-1053. Sanitizing action was tested against 7 types of vegetative bacteria with method No. DIS/TSS-10. All microbicidal tests contained an added soil load; in all AOAC tests, it was 5% fetal bovine serum, and, in QCT-1, a mixture of 3 types of proteins in phosphate buffer was used instead. The methods to test for acute oral, dermal, inhalation toxicities, and dermal and eye irritation as well as skin sensitization complied with the requirements of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the US Environmental Protection Agency (OPPTS 870). Standard methods were also used to test compatibility with metals and plastics. RESULTS: At 20 degrees C, the full-strength product was bactericidal and virucidal in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal in 5 minutes. It was nonirritating to skin and eyes. The acute oral LD(50) (lethal dose 50%) was >5000 mg/kg. It was compatible with 12 types of plastic and 3 out of 4 metals. CONCLUSION: The tested formulation showed a high safety and materials compatibility profile in addition to being a fast acting, intermediate-level disinfectant.
TI  - Resistance in nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria: multidrug resistance to the maximum.
AB  - Nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria pose a particular difficulty for the healthcare community because they represent the problem of multidrug resistance to the maximum. Important members of the group in the United States include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Burkholderia cepacia. These organisms are niche pathogens that primarily cause opportunistic healthcare-associated infections in patients who are critically ill or immunocompromised. Multidrug resistance is common and increasing among gram-negative nonfermenters, and a number of strains have now been identified that exhibit resistance to essentially all commonly used antibiotics, including antipseudomonal penicillins and cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and carbapenems. Polymyxins are the remaining antibiotic drug class with fairly consistent activity against multidrug-resistant strains of P aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp, and S maltophilia.

TI  - Epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli  at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand, 2003.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted from August to September, 2003 to determine the prevalence and risk factors in acquiring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing gram-negative bacilli (GNB) in patients admitted to Siriraj Hospital and the outcomes of these infections. Of 346 isolates of gram-negative bacteria in 249 patients, 102 isolates from 87 patients were colonization only, but 244 isolates from 162 patients were infections. The common GNB were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter cloacae. The overall prevalence of ESBL producers was 30.1%. K. pneumoniae had a very high prevalence of ESBL producers (56.9%). The urinary tract was the most common site for ESBL- producing GNB infections. Nosocomial infections, duration from admission to infection, peripheral line, urinary catheterization, nasogastric tube insertion and previous use of beta-lactams, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones were associated with acquiring ESBL-producing GNB infections. ESBL-producing GNB were significantly more resistant to antimicrobial agents. More than 80% of ESBL-producing GNB were susceptible to carbapenems. Mortality in patients infected with ESBL-producing GNB (41.3%) was significantly higher than those infected with non- ESBL-producing GNB (19.8%).
TI  - Multicenter pilot survey of resistant bacteria in the Mediterranean area.
AB  - With the aim of testing the feasibility of a multiresistant bacteria (MRB) surveillance methodology and evaluating the level of antimicrobial resistance and dissemination of resistant pathogens in the Mediterranean area, a pilot study was carried out in nine university hospitals in Algeria, Tunisia and France. The results indicate that third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae comprise the major MRB in Algerian and Tunisian hospitals. In France, the highest incidence rates were found for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, while in Tunisian hospitals, imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii seems to be a particularly prevalent organism. Although the data were not representative of the participating countries as a whole, the results show the importance and ubiquity of the problem in the area and the feasibility of surveillance.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent articles of clinical and investigational interest on Gram-negative pneumonia, particularly hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia, are reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: The high rate of respiratory infections due to Gram-negative bacteria in late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia has been repeatedly documented. The predominant pathogens are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. On the other hand, the frequency of Gram-negative bacteria in community-acquired pneumonia and in early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia is increasing. Patients with risk factors for infection with resistant pathogens should initially receive a combination therapy that covers a broad spectrum, and, as soon as the pathogen and the susceptibilities are available, treatment should be simplified to a more targeted one (with the possible exception of P. aeruginosa pneumonia). Adequate dosing is of great importance and the use of pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic principles when prescribing antibiotics increases effectiveness. The optimal duration of therapy remains unknown; several studies have supported the use of shorter courses of treatment. Alternative treatment approaches (e.g. vaccines) are under investigation. SUMMARY: The increasing frequency of resistant Gram-negative bacteria and the shortage of newer antibiotics in the pipeline with activity against Gram-negative bacteria is of concern. Early effective antimicrobial treatment is a key for the resolution of infection and improved survival.
TI  - Sequence and organization of pMAC, an Acinetobacter baumannii plasmid harboring genes involved in organic peroxide resistance.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii 19606 harbors pMAC, a 9540-bp plasmid that contains 11 predicted open-reading frames (ORFs). Cloning and transformation experiments using Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BD413 mapped replication functions within a region containing four 21-bp direct repeats (ori) and ORF 1, which codes for a predicted replication protein. Subcloning and tri-parental mating experiments mapped mobilization functions to the product of ORF 11 and an adjacent predicted oriT. Three ORFs code for proteins that share similarity to hypothetical proteins encoded by plasmid genes found in other bacteria, while the predicted products of three others do not match any known sequence. The product of ORF 8 is similar to Ohr, a hydroperoxide reductase responsible for organic peroxide detoxification and resistance in bacteria. This ORF is immediately upstream of a coding region whose product is related to the MarR family of transcriptional regulators. Disk diffusion assays showed that A. baumannii 19606 is resistant to the organic peroxide-generating compounds cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP), although to levels lower than those detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Cloning and introduction of the ohr and marR ORFs into Escherichia coli was associated with an increase in resistance to CHP and t-BHP. This appears to be the first case in which the genetic determinants involved in organic peroxide resistance are located in an extrachromosomal element, a situation that can facilitate the horizontal transfer of genetic elements coding for a function that protects bacterial cells from oxidative damage.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of invasive pathogens: the Estonian experience.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive Gram-negative pathogens in Estonia. The antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) protocols. Despite the higher rate of Gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for Gram negative pathogens. The higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL)-producing strains was 23% among Klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among E. coli. The inclusion of invasive Gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.
TI  - Toxicity of polymyxins: a systematic review of the evidence from old and recent studies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing problem of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria  causing severe infections and the shortage of new antibiotics to combat them has led to the re-evaluation of polymyxins. These antibiotics were discovered from different species of Bacillus polymyxa in 1947; only two of them, polymyxin B and E (colistin), have been used in clinical practice. Their effectiveness in the treatment of infections due to susceptible gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, has not been generally questioned. However, their use was abandoned, except in patients with cystic fibrosis, because of concerns related to toxicity. METHODS: We reviewed old and recent evidence regarding polymyxin-induced toxicity by searching Pubmed (from 1950 until May 2005). RESULTS: It was reported in the old literature that the use of polymyxins was associated with considerable toxicity, mainly nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, including neuromuscular blockade. However, recent studies showed that the incidence of nephrotoxicity is less common and severe compared to the old studies. In addition, neurotoxic effects of polymyxins are usually mild and resolve after prompt discontinuation of the antibiotics. Furthermore, cases of neuromuscular blockade and apnea have not been reported in the recent literature. CONCLUSION: New evidence shows that polymyxins have less toxicity than previously reported. The avoidance of concurrent administration of nephrotoxic and/or neurotoxic drugs, careful dosing, as well as more meticulous management of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities and use of critical care services may be some of the reasons for the discrepancy between data reported in the old and recent literature.
TI  - Incidence of antimicrobial-resistant ventilator associated pneumonia: an eighteen-month survey.
AB  - AIM: Microbes commonly involved in ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) are difficult to eradicate: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are often resistant to piperacillin, aztreonam and ceftazidim while Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae are resistant to third generation cephalosporins. Physicians need to tailor their therapeutic approach depending on individual patients and clinical setting, firmly based on local epidemiology. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of VAP caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria in our ICU. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients mechanically ventilated for longer than 72 h, who developed pneumonia over an eighteen-month period for whom final culture data were available. One-hundred and forty-three patients admitted to a University Hospital medical surgical ICU were included in this survey. VAP was diagnosed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and confirmed by mini- bronchoalveolar lavage. RESULTS: In this study, the incidence of VAP in the period January 1, 2002-June 31, 2003 was very high, accounting for about 20% of all at-risk cases. Multiresistant agents were involved in about 57% of VAP occurring within 7 days of mechanical ventilation, and in 80% of late VAP. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed differences in VAP incidence and features among our ICU and literature data, indicating a need for caution when using hospital infection surveillance data for comparisons and choice of therapy. In our setting, with high levels of antibiotic resistance, combined approaches of non-antibiotic using strategies and education programs might be beneficial.
TI  - Polymyxins: older antibiotics for a new threat.
AB  - Polymyxin B and colistin have demonstrated reasonable success in infections due to multidrug-resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Polymyxins are only recommended for highly selected cases of serious infections caused by gram-negative bacilli resistant to currently available antibiotics to avoid their potential toxicity. Pharmacodynamic studies are still needed to determine appropriate dosage regimens that will optimize effectiveness and minimize toxicity.
TI  - Inter-country transfer of Gram-negative organisms carrying the VIM-4 and OXA-58 carbapenem-hydrolysing enzymes.
AB  
TI  - Potentially multidrug-resistant non-fermentative Gram-negative pathogens causing  nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  - Owing to its high morbidity and mortality, nosocomial pneumonia represents a particularly serious illness and one of the most frequent complications in ventilated patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Gram-negative microorganisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, are the most relevant pathogens responsible for particularly difficult-to-treat nosocomial pneumonia. The intrinsic resistance of these bacteria to many antimicrobial agents and, in addition, the variety of their increasingly recognised acquired resistance mechanisms make their management in the hospital setting problematic. Antimicrobials that retain the best activity against P. aeruginosa include carbapenems, piperacillin, cefepime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and certain aminoglycosides, whilst carbapenems and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim remain the most active agents against A. baumannii and S. maltophilia, respectively. However, the growing emergence among these microorganisms of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates and the severity of associated infections call for potential alternative drugs. Sulbactam alone or in combination with ampicillin may represent an acceptable option for MDR A. baumannii as well as colistin, which also covers MDR P. aeruginosa. Newer fluoroquinolones and some tetracyclines may be alternative drugs both for MDR S. maltophilia and A. baumannii. However, large-scale controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm these promising therapeutic options.
TI  - In vitro activities of non-traditional antimicrobials alone or in combination against multidrug-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from intensive care units.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of a number of non-traditional antibiotics (colistin, azithromycin, doxycycline and rifampicin) against multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from Intensive Care Units (ICUs). We also used the checkerboard method to determine whether combinations of colistin with another non-traditional antibiotic or meropenem act synergistically against these strains. Thirty-five P. aeruginosa and 25 A. baumannii strains that were found to be MDR were included the study. Isolates were collected from the specimens of patients in ICUs from 2001 to 2003. All isolates were identified by standard methods and stored at -20 degrees C until use. Antibiotic powders of azithromycin, doxycycline, rifampicin, meropenem and colistin were obtained from their manufacturers. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar. Five strains of A. baumannii and five strains of P. aeruginosa, all of which had different MIC values for colistin, were selected for the synergy study using the checkerboard titration method. The susceptibility results for doxycycline and meropenem were interpreted according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. The susceptibility breakpoints for colistin and rifampicin were established as 4 mg/L and 2 mg/L, respectively, based on previous studies. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were used as control strains. Testing against the P. aeruginosa strains revealed high MIC50 values for all the drugs except colistin. Doxycycline and colistin were both effective against the A. baumannii strains, with high susceptibility rates of 92% and 100%, respectively. Azithromycin had a high MIC50 value against these strains, whilst rifampicin had a moderate effect (susceptibility rate 64%). The combination of colistin and rifampicin was fully synergistic against four A. baumannii and two P. aeruginosa strains. Combinations of colistin with meropenem and of colistin with azithromycin each showed synergistic activity against three A. baumannii isolates, whilst the same combinations resulted in generally additive or indifferent effects against P. aeruginosa strains. The colistin and doxycycline combination was generally partially synergistic or additive against all the isolates. MDR strains of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, which cause nosocomial infections with an increasing ratio in recent years, have limited treatment options. According to our in vitro study results, non-traditional antibiotics such as doxycycline and colistin can be an alternative for the treatment of infections caused by these strains. Combinations of colistin with non-traditional antibiotics or meropenem could be promising alternatives for the treatment of infections due to MDR strains of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Bacteriologic profile of bacteremia due to multi-drug resistant bacteria at Charles-Nicolle Hospital of Tunis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors had for aim to evaluate the place of multi-drug resistant  bacteria (MDR) in nosocomial bacteremia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out at the Microbiology laboratory of Charles Nicolle hospital of Tunis (2001-2003). One hundred and ninety-five isolated MDR [third generation cephalosporin resistant enterobacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime and imipenem]. An automated system was used to detect bloodstream infections. Microorganism identification was performed by conventional methods and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: MDR bacteria were resistant to third generation cephalosporins (29%), A. baumannii (24%), P. aeruginosa (24%), and MRSA (10%). ERC3G were resistant to aminosides and fluorquinolones. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa had high resistance rates. Associated resistance rates in MRSA were moderate. CONCLUSION: MDR bacteria are of great concern in our hospital. This situation emphasizes the importance to maintain rigorous measures of hygiene as well as adapted antibiotic prescriptions.
TI  - OXA-type carbapenemases.
AB  - In recent years, the number of class D beta-lactamases with carbapenem-hydrolysing properties has increased substantially. Based on amino acid sequence identities, these class D or OXA-type carbapenemases are divided into eight distantly related groups, and they are only remotely related to other class D beta-lactamases. A putative ancestor to one of the plasmid-encoded OXA-type carbapenemases has been found. OXA-type carbapenemases are not integrated into integrons as gene cassettes like many class D oxacillinases, but most of the OXA-type carbapenemases are instead encoded by chromosomal genes. Some of these OXA-type carbapenemases are widely dispersed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and especially in Acinetobacter baumannii. Although most of the OXA-type carbapenemases show only weak carbapenemase activity, carbapenem resistance may result from a combined action an OXA-type carbapenemase and a secondary resistance mechanism such as porin deficiencies or overexpressed efflux pumps. This article reviews the phylogeny and the genetic environments of the encoding genes and kinetic properties of the OXA-type carbapenemases.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 3 against multidrug-resistant nosocomial strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii was evaluated. A fast bactericidal effect (within 20 min) against all bacterial strains tested was observed. The presence of 20% human serum abolished the bactericidal activity of hBD-3 against gram-negative strains and reduced the activity of the peptide against gram-positive strains.
TI  - In vitro activity of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents in combination with aztreonam tested against metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - We evaluate the antimicrobial interactions between aztreonam and selected beta-lactams when tested against metallo-beta-lactamase (MbetaL)-producing clinical strains. Ten Pseudomonsa aeruginosa strains, including nine MbetaL-producers (IMP-1, -2, -13, -16, VIM-1, -2, -7, SPM-1 and GIM-1) and five Acinetobacter baumannii strains, including three MbetaL-producers (IMP-1 and -2) were tested using time kill/bactericidal activity methods. Aztreonam at 4, 8 and 16 mg/L was combined with four other beta-lactam antimicrobials (cefepime, ceftazidime, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam or ampicillin/sulbactam), each tested at the recognized susceptible breakpoint concentration. Enhanced activity (synergism or additive effect) was observed with four P. aeruginosa strains (IMP-16, VIM-2, SPM-1 and GIM-1 containing strains) and four A. baumannii strains, while antagonism was observed with two P. aeruginosa (IMP-16 and SPM-1-producing strains) and one A. baumannii (non-MbetaL) strain. All other strains showed indifferent interaction (variation of +/- 1 log10 CFU/ml) with any combination evaluated.
TI  - Comparison of the effect of delayed entry into 2 different blood culture systems  (BACTEC 9240 and BacT/ALERT 3D) on culture positivity.
AB  - The effect of delayed entry (2-48 h) into BacTAlert 3D and BACTEC 9240 and the effect of 2 storage temperatures (22 degrees C vs 35 degrees C) on bacterial growth was evaluated. The delay in transportation of blood culture bottles stored at room temperature had no effect on the recovery rate for the first 12 h. Culture positivity was between 74.4% and 100% for different microorganisms at less than 24 h preincubation time. The positivity rate decreased significantly for Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae for more than 24 h of delay. Culture positivity was higher at 22 degrees C for all microorganisms especially for Enterococcus faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Effects of instrument, preincubation time, and temperature showed that the risk of culture negativity increased 1.5 times for BACTEC compared with BacTAlert 3D and increased 2.5 times for 35 degrees C compared with 22 degrees C. The negativity increased 5.5 times and 8.5 times at 24 and 48 h of delay respectively, compared with no delay.
TI  - [Beta-lactamases of Gram negative bacteria: never-ending clockwork!].
AB  - The acquired resistance against the wide-spectrum and highly stable beta-lactams  including third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) and carbapenems is constinuously increasing and widespead with the discovery of various plasmid-encoded, or genes cassette or integrons coding for a novel beta-lactamase, always a major mechanism of resistance. To explain resistance against 3GC, with the continuing story with TEM and SHV mutated enzymes, several types of ESBL (class A) emerge the CTX-M type, at least CTX-M-40, but also other non predominant types intitled BES, GES, PLA, PER, VEB. The wider resistance including 3GC, cephamycins and beta-lactamase inhibitor is correlated to synthesis of transferable cephalosporinases (class C) usually located in the chromosome but mobilized from Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Hafnia alvei, Morganella morganii, Aeromonas caviae. Such genes encoded the following types: ACC-1, ACT-1, CFE-1, CMY group, DHA-1, FOX group, MIR-1, MOX-1. Finally the resistance against carbapemens e.g. imipenem originally restricted to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, then to Acinetobacter baumannii and finally to enterobacteria is related to production of novel enzymes (classes B, D and A) denominated IMP, VIM SME, GIM, OXA, KPC. A striking exemple of evolution towards more and more resistance is given by Salmonella, even from animal origins, a great threat fo public health. So far it appears necessary to perform molecular approaches to identify such enzymatic production. Finally because the absence of real new drugs, the discovery of some progenitors of the gene beta-lactamase, a strict control of beta-lactam antibiotics must be provide not only in medecine or veterinary field but also in agriculture, including aquaculture for example.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia : rationalizing the approach to empirical therapy.
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. It is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. In 1996 the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published guidelines for empirical therapy of HAP. This review focuses on the literature that has appeared since the ATS statement. Early diagnosis of HAP and its etiology is crucial in guiding empirical therapy. Since 1996, it has become clear that differentiating mere colonization from etiologic pathogens infecting the lower respiratory tract is best achieved by employing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or protected specimen brush (PSB) in combination with quantitative culture and detection of intracellular microorganisms. Endotracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic BAL/PSB in combination with quantitative culture provide a good alternative in patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Since culture results take 2-3 days, initial therapy of HAP is by definition empirical. Epidemiologic studies have identified the most frequently involved pathogens: Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus ('core pathogens'). Empirical therapy covering only the 'core pathogens' will suffice in patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. Studies that have appeared since the ATS statement issued in 1996, demonstrate several new risk factors for HAP with multiresistant pathogens. In patients with risk factors, empirical therapy should consist of antibacterials with a broader spectrum. The most important risk factors for resistant microorganisms are late onset of HAP (>/=5 days after admission), recent use of antibacterial therapy, and mechanical ventilation. Multiresistant bacteria of specific interest are methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Each of these organisms has its specific susceptibility pattern, demanding appropriate antibacterial treatment. To further improve outcomes, specific therapeutic options for multiresistant pathogens and pharmacological factors are discussed. Antibacterials developed since 1996 or antibacterials with renewed interest (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, meropenem, new fluoroquinolones, and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are discussed in the light of developing resistance.Since the ATS statement, many reports have shown increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms. Therefore, one of the most important conclusions from this review is that empirical therapy for HAP should not be based on general guidelines alone, but that local epidemiology should be taken into account and used in the formulation of local guidelines.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of silver dressings: an in vitro comparison.
AB  - A range of silver-coated or -impregnated dressings are now commercially available for use but comparative data on their antimicrobial efficacies are limited. The antibacterial activities of five commercially available silver-coated/impregnated dressings were compared against nine common burn-wound pathogens, namely methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii and a multi-drug-efflux-positive Acinetobacter baumannii (BM4454), using a broth culture method. The rapidity and extent of killing of these pathogens under in vitro conditions were evaluated. All five silver-impregnated dressings investigated exerted bactericidal activity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter species, Proteus species and E. coli. The spectrum and rapidity of action, however, ranged widely for different dressings. Acticoat and Contreet had a broad spectrum of bactericidal activities against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Contreet was characterized by a very rapid bactericidal action and achieved a reduction of > or =10,000 c.f.u. ml(-1) in the first 30 min for Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii. Other dressings demonstrated a narrower range of bactericidal activities. Understanding the characteristics of these dressings may enable them to be targeted more appropriately according to the specific requirements for use of a particular dressing, as in for prophylaxis in skin grafting or for an infected wound with MRSA.
TI  - Screening of antibiotics resistance to Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii by an advanced expert system.
AB  - The VITEK2 advanced expert system (AES) gives information about the antibiotics-resistance mechanisms based on the biological validation derived from the VITEK2 susceptibility result. In this study, we investigated whether or not this system correctly categorized the beta-lactamase resistance mechanism data derived from the VITEK2 susceptibility result using the testing card, AST-N025, with Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. We used 131 strains, and their phenotypes were determined according to the biological and genetic screening. The AES analysis result matched the phenotype testing in 120 (91.6%) of the 131 strains. Incorrect findings were found in six strains, including three strains of Serratia marcescens. The resistance mechanism could not be determined in five strains, including three strains of Providencia rettgeri. The analysis of those phenotypes agreed in 34 (97.1%) among 35 strains with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), and in 27 (96.4%) among 28 strains with high-level cephalosporinase. The agreement ratio in the phenotype was very high as we expected. The incorrect and nondeterminable samples were strains with relatively high cephalosporinase that has variation of outer membrane protein. The AES was able to detect the phenotype for carbapenemase. The AES is a clinically useful system that allows taking prompt measures to treat patients because it can provide information about the resistance mechanism in less than half a day after starting the analysis.
TI  - Making the most of surveillance studies: summary of the OPTAMA Program.
AB  - Antibiotic surveillance studies lack consideration of pharmacodynamics and provide little information about optimal dosing. By using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data derived from a global surveillance study and Monte Carlo simulation, the Optimizing Pharmacodynamic Target Attainment using the MYSTIC Antibiogram (OPTAMA) Program was established to impart greater understanding of the ability to attain pharmacodynamic exposure for specific dosing regimens and their relationship with percent susceptibility. Early OPTAMA studies focused on determining the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for various antibiotics against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa regionally in Europe and the Americas. Later reports considered the prevalence of specific bacteria causing infections to estimate the CFR for empiric therapy of pneumonia, bloodstream, complicated skin/skin structure, and intra-abdominal infections. Collectively, the approach of the OPTAMA Program provides a novel tool that complements susceptibility data to help in the selection of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy at the national, regional, and institutional level.
TI  - High-level expression of IMP-5 carbapenemase owing to point mutation in the -35 promoter region of class 1 integron among Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates.
AB  - Eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa producing IMP-5 carbapenemases were collected from three Portuguese hospitals. All isolates were epidemiologically unrelated. The bla(IMP-5) gene was inserted into a class 1 integron previously reported in Acinetobacter baumannii 65FFC. Expression of the the bla(IMP-5) gene in P. aeruginosa has been shown to be driven by the P(1) promoter [TTGATA] in which the cytosine was replaced by thymine, which caused an increase in transcription of bla(IMP-5) that was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem for Escherichia coli pGMLA-1 (the recombinant from A. baumannii 65FFC) and E. coli pATG-2 (the recombinant from P. aeruginosa isolates) were 0.5 mg/L and >32 mg/L, respectively. This study reports the spread of a class 1 integron In76 with a new point mutation in the P(1) promoter sequence leading to overproduction of IMP-5.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other antimicrobial agents against clinically isolated organisms in Taiwan.
AB  - This study evaluated the in vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other comparators against 861 bacterial isolates recovered from patients treated in three major teaching hospitals in 2003. MICs to antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. High rates of oxacillin resistance (58%) in Staphylococcus aureus (60 isolates), and vancomycin resistance (21%) and quinupristin-dalfopristin non-susceptibility (39%) in Enterococcus faecium (34 isolates) were found. Carbapenems had excellent in vitro activities (>or=98% susceptibility) against the 419 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, with the MIC(50) and MIC(90) of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem being 0.25 and 4 mg/L, 0.03 and 0.12 mg/L, and 0.03 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. For, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (74 isolates) and Burkholderia cepacia (21 isolates), meropenem (MIC(90), 0.25, 2, and 4 mg/L, respectively) had better in vitro activities than imipenem (MIC(90), 8, 4, and 32 mg/L, respectively) and ertapenem (MIC(90), 0.5, >32, and 32 mg/L, respectively). Isepamicin had a similar activity with amikacin against all Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, B. cepacia, and Acinetobacter baumannii, except for C. freundii isolates in which isepamicin had an eight-fold activity better than amikacin. Tigecycline had excellent in vitro activities against all isolates tested (MIC(90), <or=1 mg/L) including 14 pandrugresistant A. baumannii isolates (MICs, 1-4 mg/L), except for Proteus mirabilis (59 isolates; MIC(90), 8 mg/L), Bacteroides fragilis (60 isolates; MIC(90), 8 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC(90), 16 mg/L), and B. cepacia (21 isolates; MIC(90), 16 mg/L). Tigecycline, carbapenems, and isepamicin exhibited better or comparable in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of commonly encountered bacteria than other comparator antimicrobials and may represent therapeutic options for infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - [Evaluation of disk diffusion test for carbapenem sensitivity in Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains].
AB  - This study was conducted upon the detection of discordant results obtained for Acinetobacter species against meropenem by disk diffusion susceptibility and E-test method. The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability of disk diffusion method for the determination of carbapenem susceptibility in non-fermentative bacilli. Carbapenem (imipenem and meropenem) sensitivites of 157 Acinetobacter baumanii and 157 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were performed by disk diffusion test and E-test in our laboratory where quality control of antibiotic susceptibility tests are performed weekly. For meropenem, discordance of the two tests were 10.8% and 4.5% for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. MIC values and disk diffusion zone diameters were significantly different from each other. There was no difference in terms of imipenem in A. baumannii strains but 5.1% of P. aeruginosa isolates showed discordance. Since, for the P. aeruginosa isolates with discordant imipenem susceptibility results, the imipenem disk diffusion zones were close to the lower level and their MIC values were within the intermediate resistance range, it was assumed that this technical discordance had low risk of reproducibility. In routine laboratories, meropenem resistance detected by disk diffusion method, should be verified by another technique. This is not only important for patient results but for epidemiological data as well. Routine quality control studies for antibiotic susceptibility tests and close observation of suspicious results, is mandatory for each laboratory, in order to achieve good quality performance.
TI  - [Comparison of different phenotypic methods detecting extended spectrum beta-lactamases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains].
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii which are of great concern as  the frequent causative agents of nosocomial infections, frequently exhibit resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. One of the most common causes of this resistance is the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). There is still no standardized method for the detection of ESBLs in P. aeruginosa and A.baumannii strains. The aim of this study was to compare the results of Epsilomer test (E-test), combined disk (CD) and double disk synergy (DDS) methods for the detection of ESBL in a total of 38 P. aeruginosa and 45 A.baumannii strains with ceftazidim or cefotaxime MIC > or = 1 microg/ml, isolated from different clinical samples. Cefepime was included in the group of indicator antibiotics and the distance between clavulanic acid containing disk and indicator antibiotic disks was reduced to increase the sensitivity of DDS test. Of the P. aeruginosa strains, 78.9% was detected as ESBL producers by ceftazidime/ ceftazidime-clavulanic acid and 21.1% detected by cefotaxime/cefotaxime-clavulanic acid ratio. Among this group of strains, 31.5% was positive by DDS test and 84.2% was positive by CD method. Of the A.baumannii strains, 93.3% of them was positive by ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanic acid and 6.6% was positive by cefotaxime/cefotaxime-clavulanic acid ratio. DDS test detected 20% and CD method detected 53.3% of the strains positive by E-test method. The use of cefotaxime together with ceftazidime as an indicator antibiotic increased the sensitivity of detection of ESBL enzymes. Although inclusion of cefepime and reduction of the distance between disks increased the detection of ESBL by DDS method, it was still less effective than E-test. Although, 28.9% of the P. aeruginosa and 13.3% of the A. baumannii strains were susceptible to ceftazidime by in vitro tests, they were ESBL producers. In conclusion, E-test method was found to be the most sensitive phenotypic method for the detection of ESBL in our study collection.
TI  - Identification of an OprD homologue in Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - With the increased number of resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains, it is urgently required to decipher the molecular bases of outer membrane permeability. The analyses of the outer membrane from different A. baumannii strains indicated a modification in the expression of two proteins of 29 and 43 kDa, respectively. By electrophoresis and MALDI-MS analyses, the 43 kDa OMP was identified as a protein belonging to the OprD family, a basic amino acid and imipenem porin.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of roselle calyx and protocatechuic acid.
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory effect of roselle calyx and protocatechuic acid, a compound derived from roselle calyx, on the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii was studied. The data from inhibition zone and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values showed that both roselle calyx extract and protocatechuic acid inhibited effectively the growth of all test bacterial pathogens, the antibacterial activity of protocatechuic acid being significantly greater than roselle calyx (p < 0.05). Furthermore, heat treatment did not affect the antibacterial activity of roselle calyx and protocatechuic acid against all test pathogens. The time-kill data from protocatechuic acid showed this agent provided concentration dependent antibacterial activities in broth and human plasma (p < 0.05); however, protocatechuic acid showed less inhibitory activity in human plasma than in broth (p < 0.05). These agents based on their lower MIC values, heat tolerance and concentration dependent antibacterial activity may be useful in clinical infection prevention or therapy.
TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of bacterial pneumonia in liver transplantation recipients: report of 33 cases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial pneumonia in the recipients of liver transplantation (LTX)  is a common postoperative complication influencing the prognosis greatly. In this article, the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial pneumonia in 33 LTX recipients are reported. METHODS: From February 1999 to January 2003, a total of 103 patients underwent allogeneic LTX at our center; afterwards, a retrospective analysis was made on their postoperative clinical manifestations, including symptoms (expectoration, panting and fever), sign (rale), results of laboratory examinations (white blood cell count and sputum culture of tracheal secretions or pleural fluid culture), and chest X-ray films. The following data of the pneumonia and non-pneumonia groups were collected, and the rank sum test (SPSS 11.0, Wilcoxon's method) was used to analyze the duration of postoperative respirator utilization and the volume of pleural effusion through pleurocentesis or pleural drainage. RESULTS: In the 103 patients, 33 experienced 53 episodes of bacterial pneumonia during their hospital stay after transplantation, 14 of them (42.42%) had more than three manifestations of the seven mentioned above. The pathogens causing bacterial pneumonia included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.48%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.53%), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.68%), and Staphylococcus aureus (7.77%). Amilkacin, tienam, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, etc. were the antibiotics of choice against those bacteria. Acute rejection occurred during the treatment of bacterial pneumonia in 16 patients, and 5 of them died. Wilcoxon's rank sum test of the data indicated that the pneumonia group had longer duration of postoperative ventilator treatment and larger volume of pleural effusion than the non-pneumonia group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations of pneumonia after LTX might be atypical, and special attention should be paid to the respiratory symptoms and signs within 2 months after LTX. Whenever the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia is confirmed, consideration should be given to reasonable use of antibiotics and regulation of immunity in addition to other routine therapies.
TI  - [Etiology of severe hospital infections in intensive care units and antibiotic resistance of pathogens].
AB  - The leading pathogens of severe infections in intensive care units were the following: respiratory tract infections--bacteria of the famility of Enterobacteriaceae (33.8%), Pseudomonas spp. (24.9%), Acinetobacter spp. (18.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.0%), blood flow infections--coagulase negative staphylococci (33.6%), S. aureus (26.1%), Enterobacteriaceae (17.6%), wound infections--Enterobacteriaceae (35.7%), coagulase negative staphyloccocci (17.8%), Pseudomonas spp. (14.3%). As for various species of Enterobacteriaceae, susceptibility was preserved in 91-100% of the isolates to meropenem, in 72-100% to cefoperazone/sulbactam, in 51-65% to cefepime, in 72-86% to amikacin, and in less than 50% to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. As for P.aeruginosa, 28% of the isolates was resistant to all the antibacterials, except polymyxin. The highest susceptibility to cefoperazone/sulbactam and meropenem was revealed in the isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii. Oxacillin resistance was detected in 64.9% of the S.aureus isolates. The oxacillin resistance as a rule was associated with resistance to macrolides, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. As for coagulase negative staphylococci, oxacillin resistance was stated in 75.6% of the isolates. All the isolates of the Staphylococcus spp. preserved their susceptibility to vancomycin and linezolid.
TI  - [Diagnostics and management of central venous line infections in pediatric cancer patients].
AB  - Otherwise unexplained clinical signs of infection in patients with tunneled or totally implanted central venous access devices (CVAD) are highly suspicious of an underlying CVAD-associated infection. Diagnostic methods include catheter swabs, blood cultures and cultures of the catheter tip or port reservoir. In case of a suspected CVAD-related blood stream infection in pediatric cancer patients in situ treatment without prompt removal of the device can be tried. The removal of the CVAD should be considered, if bacteremia persists or relapses 72 hours or longer after the initiation of an (in vitro effective) antibacterial therapy administered through the line. The CVAD should be removed even earlier, if the patient suffers from hypotension or other signs of severe organ dysfunction related to the infection. If S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Candida spp.are isolated from blood cultures taken through a CVAD, patients are at a high risk for severe complications and immediate device removal is also recommended. Duration of therapy depends on the immunological recovery of the patient (neutrophils counts), the pathogen isolated and on the presence of related complications like thrombosis, pneumonia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis. Antibiotic-lock techniques in addition to systemic treatment are beneficial in Gram-positive infections. Although prospectively controlled studies are missing, the concomitant use of urokinase- or taurolidine seems to favour catheter salvage.
TI  - Evaluation of techniques for detection of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in stool surveillance cultures.
AB  - Screening for gastrointestinal colonization with multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens is an important component of infection control protocols. In the New York City region, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, which harbor the KPC carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase, have rapidly emerged. The potential utility of screening medium, which involved using 10-mug imipenem disks, was investigated. The method of placing a sample from a fecal surveillance culture into broth containing an imipenem disk appeared to have the greatest sensitivity for detecting KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. Gastrointestinal colonization with two other carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, was also detected using this method. Placing fecal surveillance specimens into broth containing an imipenem disk is an easy method for screening samples for carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - DNA microarray-based detection of nosocomial pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Infection by nosocomial pathogenic bacteria is increasingly becoming a major threat to the patients in the hospital. We have developed a diagnostic DNA microarray for the detection of two important nosocomial pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The diagnostic DNA microarray contains the species-specific probes of 15mer oligonucleotides designed based on the sequences of 23S ribosomal DNA. The performance of DNA microarray in diagnosing P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was evaluated using reference bacteria as well as clinical specimens such as blood, stool, pus, sputum, urine and cerebrospinal fluid. Using this DNA microarray, A. baumannii could be successfully detected in 11 out of 13 clinical specimens, thus giving the sensitivity of 84.6% with the specificity of 100% and the positive predictive value of 100%. P. aeruginosa could also be detected in 25 out of 26 clinical specimens, showing the sensitivity of 96.2%, the specificity of 100%, and the positive predictive value of 100%. These results suggest that two nosocomial pathogens, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, can be efficiently diagnosed by using the DNA microarray developed in this study.
TI  - Bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  - Bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. Much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in Western countries. Reports indicate that appropriate administration of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio vulnificus, and Salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. The phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of Helicobacter pylori and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, and group B streptococci. All phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. Furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. Phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.
TI  - N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (BHL) deficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from an intensive care unit.
AB  - Acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) are self-generated diffusible signal molecules that mediate population density dependent gene expression (quorum sensing) in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria, and several virulence genes of human pathogens are known to be controlled by AHLs. In this study, strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from intensive care patients, were screened for AHL production by using AHL responsive indicator strains of Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens NT1. Positive reactions were recorded for all 50 isolates of P. aeruginosa and 10 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii with Agrobacterium tumefaciens NT1. Surprisingly, most P. aeruginosa isolates gave negative results with C. violaceum CV026 in contrast to previous reports. This suggests that the new isolates of P. aeruginosa either failed to make short chain AHLs or the level of the signal molecule is very low.
TI  - Novel acquired metallo-beta-lactamase gene, bla(SIM-1), in a class 1 integron from Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates from Korea.
AB  - Carbapenem resistance mediated by acquired carbapenemase genes has been increasingly reported, particularly for clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Of 1,234 non-duplicate isolates of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. isolated at a tertiary-care hospital in Seoul, Korea, 211 (17%) were positive for metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL). Of these, 204 (96%) had either the bla(IMP-1) or bla(VIM-2) allele. In addition, seven Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were found to have a novel MBL gene, which was designated bla(SIM-1). The SIM-1 protein has a pI of 7.2, is a new member of subclass B1, and exhibits 64 to 69% identity with the IMP-type MBLs, which are its closest relatives. All SIM-1-producing isolates exhibited relatively low imipenem and meropenem MICs (8 to 16 microg/ml) and had a multidrug resistance phenotype. Expression of the cloned bla(SIM-1) gene in Escherichia coli revealed that the encoded enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing a broad array of beta-lactams, including penicillins, narrow- to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, and carbapenems. The bla(SIM-1) gene was carried on a gene cassette inserted into a class 1 integron, which included three additional cassettes (arr-3, catB3, and aadA1). The strains were isolated from sputum and urine specimens from patients with pneumonia and urinary tract infections, respectively. All patients had various underlying diseases. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested genomic DNAs showed that the strains belonged to two different clonal lineages, indicating that horizontal transfer of this gene had occurred and suggesting the possibility of further spread of resistance in the future.
TI  - A new screening method for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a series of 1-alkyl-2-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium bromides against Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test a series of 1-alkyl-2-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium bromides with alkyl chains containing between 9 and 16 carbons against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemical synthesis was based on the reaction of 2,4'-bipyridyl with alkyl bromide. Antimicrobial activity of the bipyridyls was measured by growing bacterial cultures on Mueller-Hinton agar in the presence and absence of inhibitors. RESULTS: The compounds were most active against S. aureus. The most active compounds had alkyl chain lengths of between 11 and 16 carbons. Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus was more susceptible to the inhibitors than methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Two subclasses of MRSA existed which differed in their susceptibility to the inhibitors. The susceptibility of MRSA strains to the compounds was increased in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor reserpine. The activity of the compounds against Gram-negative organisms was increased when the membrane-permeabilizing agent sodium citrate was introduced. Critical micelle concentrations of the compounds were much higher than minimum inhibitory concentrations of the inhibitors. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of action of the compounds may involve perturbing bacterial membranes. The resistance of some MRSA strains to the compounds may be related to efflux pumps.
TI  - Detection of metallo beta-lactamase production and antibiotic resistance with E-test method in pseudomonas, acinetobacter and klebsiella strains, in Turkey.
AB  - The metallo beta-lactamase (MBL) mediated resistance patterns remain unknown in most countries. We aimed to investigate the existence and antimicrobial resistance of MBL-producing strains among carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria that were isolated from nosocomial infections in patients in an university hospital in Turkey. Fifteen of 52 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (29%), 5 of 24 Acinetobacter baumanii strains (21%), and 2 of 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (100%) were found to be metallo enzyme producers, with the Etest MBL technique. The in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of the MBL-positive organisms was investigated by the Etest method. Of the ten drugs tested, isepamicin was the most active agent against the MBL-producing strains. Overall, the rank order of activity of the ten antibiotics, in terms of the percentages of susceptible strains, was: isepamicin, 73%; ciprofloxacin, 64%; amikacin, 59%; aztreonam, 18%; tobramycin, 18%; meropenem, 14%; cefoperazone-sulbactam, 5%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 0%; ticarcillin-clavulanate, 0%; and cefepim, 0%. The meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the metallo enzyme-producing and nonproducing carbapenem-resistant strains were compared, and the MBL-producers were found to have higher meropenem MICs than the nonMBL-producing carbapenem-resistant strains. Early preventive measures should be taken against MBL-producing nosocomial pathogens that are associated with wide spread and high antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Comparison of beta-lactam regimens for the treatment of gram-negative pulmonary infections in the intensive care unit based on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study utilized pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics to compare beta-lactam regimens for the empirical and definitive treatment of gram-negative pulmonary infections in the ICU. METHODS: Susceptibility data were extracted from the 2002 Intensive Care Unit Surveillance System (ISS) and pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained from published human studies. Monte Carlo simulation was used to model the free percent time above the MIC (free %T > MIC) for 18 beta-lactam regimens against all gram-negative isolates, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was determined for bacteriostatic and bactericidal targets (free %T > MIC): penicillins (> or = 30/50%), cephalosporins/monobactams (> or = 40/70%) and carbapenems (> or = 20/40%). RESULTS: The 2002 ISS database contained MICs for 2408 gram-negative isolates including 1430 Enterobacteriaceae, 799 P. aeruginosa, and 179 A. baumannii. Imipenem had the highest percentage susceptible for all gram-negatives, Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii, while piperacillin/tazobactam had the highest percentage susceptible for P. aeruginosa. For empirical therapy, imipenem 0.5 g every 6 h, cefepime 2 g every 8 h and ceftazidime 2 g every 8 h demonstrated the highest CFR. For definitive therapy, imipenem 0.5 g every 6 h, ertapenem 1 g daily and cefepime 2 g every 8 h, cefepime 1 g every 8 h and cefepime 1 g every 12 h had the highest bactericidal CFR against Enterobacteriaceae; ceftazidime 2 g every 8 h, cefepime 2 g every 8 h, piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g every 4 h, ceftazidime 1 g every 8 h and aztreonam 1 g every 8 h against P. aeruginosa; and imipenem 0.5 g every 6 h, ticarcillin/clavulanate 3.1 g every 4 h, ceftazidime 2 g every 8 h, cefepime 2 g every 8 h and ticarcillin/clavulanate 3.1 g every 6 h against A. baumannii. CONCLUSIONS: Based on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, imipenem 0.5 g every 6 h, cefepime 2 g every 8 h and ceftazidime 2 g every 8 h should be the preferred beta-lactam regimens for the empirical treatment of gram-negative pulmonary infections in the ICU. The order of preference varied against Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.
TI  - Contamination of patients' files in intensive care units: an indication of strict handwashing after entering case notes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent to which bedside patients' files become contaminated and the range of bacterial flora attributable to contamination in high-risk areas of the hospital are not known with certainty. The aim of the present study was to determine the degree of contamination of the patient's files and also to analyze and compare the spectrum of contaminant bacterial flora between the intensive care unit (ICU) and surgical wards, the 2 most high-risk areas for nosocomial transmission of infection. METHODS: Microbiologic samples were collected from the exposed outer surface of the patients' files kept bedside in the ICU and surgical wards with sterile swabs moistened with sterile normal saline. Swabs were cultured within an hour of collection on blood agar and MacConkey's agar plates, which were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. Gram-negative bacilli were identified by Gram's stain, catalase, oxidase tests, and API 20E and API 20NE. Staphylococcus species were identified by Gram's stain, catalase test, and tube coagulase test. Antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated bacteria was determined by the disk diffusion technique according to the criteria of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). RESULTS: In ICU, 85.2% (87/102) and, in surgical wards, 24.7% (22/89) of patient's files were found to be contaminated with pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria (OR, 17.664; 95% CI: 8.050-39.423; P < .0001). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated bacteria (32.3%, 33/102) in ICUs, whereas Staphylococcus aureus was the peak contaminant (11.2%, 10/89) of the files in surgical wards. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was isolated from 6.8% (7/102) of ICU patient's files, whereas only 1.1% (1/89) of patient's files in surgical wards were contaminated with MRSA (OR, 6.484; 95% CI: 3.215-13.463; P < .0001). The multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serretia marcesens isolated from the patient's files had the same antibiotic resistance pattern as of these bacteria isolated from the patients. CONCLUSION: The majority of the patient's files in ICUs were contaminated often with multidrug-resistant bacteria and even MRSA. Contaminated files could be a source of transmission of infection. To prevent this, handwashing practice should be strictly followed after attending the patient and before entering the case notes in the patient's file. The maintenance of good hand hygiene by the health care workers (HCWs) after handling contaminated files should perhaps be the most prudent approach to prevent patient-patient transmission of infection in high-risk areas including ICU and surgical wards.
TI  - [Beta-lactamases and their role in resistance. PART 2: beta-lactamases in 21st century].
AB  - Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics continues to increase, mostly due to the presence of various beta-lakta mases. As a result of the ability of the plasmids to acquire additional resistance determinants, many of the beta-lactamase producing pathogens became multidrug resistant. The most important beta-lactamases which compomise the use of beta-lactams nowdays are extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, inhibitor-resistant TEM and SHV beta-lactamases and carbapenemases. Carbapenemases are beta-lactamases which hydrolyse carbapenems. They belong to molecular classes A, B, and D. Class A comprises carbapenemases sensitive to inhibition by clavulanic acid. Most of them are chromosomaly encoded, but some of them are plasmid-mediated such as KPC-1 in Klebsiella pneumoniae and GES-2 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The class B carbapenemases are metallo-beta-lactamases of the IMP or VIM group. The class D carbapenemases are the most frequent in Acinetobacter baumannii but confer resistance to carbapenems only if other resistance mechanisms such as porin alterations, are present. Inhibitor resistant beta-lactamases are one of the most important causes of resistance to beta-lactam-inhibitor combinations. The resistance to these formulations can be also due to hyperproduction of TEM-1 beta-lactamase, modifications of the outer membrane proteins or production of OXA-type enzymes. IRT enzymes are derived from parenthal TEM-1 or TEM-2 beta-lactamases by point mutations in the beta-lactamase gene. The frequent use of beta-lactamase inhibitors in hospitals and general practice pose a selection pressure which favours spread of such strains in hospitals and community.
TI  - Advances in the management of pneumonia in the intensive care unit: review of current thinking.
AB  - Interventions to prevent pneumonia in the intensive care unit should combine multiple measures targeting the invasive devices, microorganisms and protection of the patient. Microbiological investigation is useful for evaluating the quality of the respiratory sample, and permits early modification of the regimen in light of the microbiological findings. Once pneumonia develops, the appropriateness of the initial antibiotic regimen is a vital determinant of outcome. Three questions should be formulated: (1) is the patient at risk of acquiring methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, (2) is Acinetobacter baumannii a problem in the institution, and (3) is the patient at risk of acquiring Pseudomonas aeruginosa? Antibiotic therapy should be started immediately and must circumvent any pathogen resistance mechanisms developed after previous antibiotic exposure. Therefore, antibiotic choice should be institution-specific and patient-oriented.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Zuccagnia punctata Cav. ethanolic extracts.
AB  - The present study was conducted to investigate antibacterial activity of Zuccagnia punctata ethanolic extract against 47 strains of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and to identify bioactive compounds. Inhibition of bacterial growth was investigated using agar diffusion, agar macrodilution, broth microdilution and bioautographic methods. Zuccagnia punctata extract was active against all assayed bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 25 to 200 microg/mL. Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were identical or two-fold higher than the corresponding MIC values. Contact bioautography, indicated that Zuccagnia punctata extracts possess one major antibacterial component against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and at least three components against. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Activity-guided fractionation of 1he ethanol extract on a silica gel column yielded a compound (2',4'-dihydroxychalcone), which exhibited strong antibacterial activity with MIC values between 0.10 and 1.00 microg/mL for Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. These values are lower than imipenem (0.25-16 microg/mL). Zuccagnia punctata might provide promising therapeutic agents against infections with multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamase among Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from burn wounds and in vitro activities of antibiotic combinations against these isolates.
AB  - The prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) produced by isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii and the activities of various antmicrobial combinations against MBL producer strains were investigated. During the period from June 2003 till July 2004, 120 P. aeruginosa and 9 A. baumannii nonduplicate isolates were obtained from burn wounds. Forty strains (37 P. aeruginosa, 3 A. baumannii) were selected because of resistance to carbapenems. Screening for MBL production was performed in the latter isolates by the combined disk method which depends on comparing the zones given by disks containing imipenem with and without ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Of imipenem resistant P. aeruginosa strains, 21 and 1 of A. baumannii were found metallo-beta-lactamase producers. Disk approximation studies were then performed to test for in vitro activities of various antimicrobial combinations. For a total of 21 P. aeruginosa strains, synergy was demonstrated predominantly by ciprofloxacin in combination with ceftazidime and imipenem, by ofloxacin in combination with astreonam. Against MBL producer A. baumannii strain, synergy was detected only with imipenem-ofloxacin combination. None of the combinations were antagonistic. These results suggest that MBL producing P. aeruginosa and A. baumanni strains have been introduced into burn centers, and to prevent the further spread of MBL producers, it is essential for carbapenem resistant isolates to be screened for MBLs.
TI  - Evaluation of a clinical pathway for ventilator-associated pneumonia: changes in  bacterial flora and the adequacy of empiric antibiotics over a three-year period.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of causative pathogens is vital for optimizing empiric antibiotic therapy of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Based on previous data (Ann Surg 1998;227:743-755), empiric antibiotics for our VAP clinical pathway were modified to target early and late occurring pathogens (ampicillin/sulbactam during the first week of hospitalization; cefepime plus vancomycin afterwards). The objectives of this study were to compare organisms causing VAP over a three-year period to previous data, and to determine the adequacy of the empiric antibiotic regimens. METHODS: A total of 299 critically ill trauma patients with VAP over a three-year period were studied retrospectively. The incidence of pathogens causing VAP in the study period were compared to a previously published study of a two-year period in our intensive care unit (ICU). Sensitivities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were evaluated over the study period. The adequacy of empiric antibiotic therapy for each episode of VAP was determined. Therapy was considered to be adequate if one or more antibiotics had in vitro activity against the organism causing VAP. RESULTS: Statistically significant changes in pathogens included increased Staphylococcus aureus (incidence 17% vs. 11%, p = 0.024) and decreased Acinetobacter baumannii (11% vs. 22%, p < 0.001). Susceptibility patterns were statistically unchanged except for increased resistance of P. aeruginosa to extended-spectrum penicillins (p = 0.016). Empiric therapy was adequate in 76% of VAP episodes. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical pathway's empiric antibiotic regimen was associated with only modest changes in organisms causing VAP and provided a high rate of adequate empiric coverage.
TI  - The threat of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria: beta-lactams in peril!
AB  - Beta-lactam antibiotics are the cornerstone of our antibiotic armamentarium. By inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, they are highly effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Unfortunately, bacteria have evolved sophisticated resistance mechanisms to combat the lethal effects of beta-lactam antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae are all able to evade killing by penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems. This multi-drug resistant phenotype that challenges health care workers worldwide is caused by an array of resistance determinants. These include altered expression of outer membrane proteins and efflux pumps, along with an increasing arsenal of beta-lactamases. Future strategies in beta-lactam design must take into account the complex nature of resistance in Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Respiratory tract infection caused by bacteria (non-Mycobacterium) and their antibiogram in HIV-positive patients.
AB  - Abstract. This study was undertaken from 1995-2000 to investigate the cause of respiratory tract infection among 481 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. The positive rate of bacterial pathogens was 38.46%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa appeared to be the most common pathogen (32.97%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18.92%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.81 %), Haemophilus influenzae (7.57%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (5.95%). P. aeruginosa was sensitive to netilmycin, amikacin, imipenem, meropenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gentamicin (67-84%). S. aureus was sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin (100%).
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in a Cardiology Institute in Istanbul, Turkey.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance among Gram-negative rods (GNRs) causing hospital-acquired infections poses a threat, particularly to intensive care unit (ICU) patients. This study was undertaken in order to achieve the following: to detect the frequency of GNRs isolated from coronary and surgical ICUs at the Institute of Cardiology, Istanbul University, between January 2000-December 2002; to compare the resistance of these GNRs to selected antibiotics; and to determine the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). A total of 367 isolates were obtained from 171 patients. Susceptibility testing and detection of ESBLs were performed using the E-test method. Ceftazidime-clavulanate was used for the detection of ESBLs. The majority of microorganisms were isolated from the respiratory tract (45.5%) and blood (36.7%). Acinetobacter baumannii was the most frequently isolated GNR (24.5%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%). ESBL positivity was found to be 21.1%. High rates of the ESBLs of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were observed, i.e., 27.7 and 57.5%, respectively. High rates of resistance to all antibiotics studied were observed. The most active agent against the majority of the isolates was imipenem (79.2%), followed by levofloxacin (77%) and ciprofloxacin (71%).
TI  - Nebulized colistin in the treatment of pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Twenty-one patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia were treated with nebulized polymyxin E (colistin). Overall clinical and microbiological response rates were 57.1% and 85.7%, respectively. Nebulized colistin may be reasonably efficacious and safe for treatment of MDR pneumonia. Its role in therapy warrants further investigation in comparative studies.
TI  - Combination therapy with intravenous colistin for management of infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in patients without cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Colistin, an antibiotic almost abandoned for intravenous administration for many  years due to its reported toxicity, has been recently reintroduced in clinical practice due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria and the lack of development of new antibiotics to combat them. To assess the safety and effectiveness of intravenous colistin, in combination with other antimicrobial agents, in the treatment of serious infections in patients without cystic fibrosis, a retrospective cohort study in a 450-bed tertiary-care hospital in Athens, Greece, was performed. Patients who were hospitalized from 1 October 2000 to 31 January 2004 and received intravenous colistin for more than 72 h were further analyzed. The primary outcome measure was the in-hospital mortality; secondary end points were the clinical outcome of the infections and the occurrence of colistin toxicity. Fifty patients received intravenous colistin with a median (mean) daily dose of 3 (4.5) million IU for 16.5 (21.3) days for the management of 54 episodes of infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. The predominant infections were pneumonia (33.3%), bacteremia (27.8%), urinary tract infection (11.1%), and intra-abdominal infection (11.1%). The responsible pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii (51.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (42.6%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.7%) strains (no pathogen was isolated from one case). In-hospital mortality was 24% (12/50 patients). Clinical response (cure or improvement) of the infection was observed in 66.7% of episodes (36/54). In the studied group, serum creatinine levels were decreased, at the end of colistin treatment, by an average of 0.2 +/- 1.3 mg/dl compared to baseline levels. Deterioration of renal function during colistin therapy was observed in 4/50 patients (8%). Coadministration of other antimicrobial agents with spectrum against gram-negative microorganisms and the absence of a control group constitute the major limitations of this study. The use of intravenous colistin for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria appears to be safe and effective.
TI  - Post-neurosurgical nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adults: microbiology, clinical features, and outcomes.
AB  - The clinical data of 62 adult patients who suffered post-neurosurgical nosocomial bacterial meningitis, retrospectively collected over a 16-year period, were studied. Cases were divided into two groups based on the date of presentation, the first period being 1986-1993 and the second 1994-2001. Fever and progressive consciousness disturbance were the most consistent clinical features - signs that may also be attributed to other postoperative neurosurgical problems. The common pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii. An increase in polymicrobial infections and multi-antibiotic resistance during the second period was identified. In the first half of the study, mortality was 22%, and in the second half 36%. Adult post-neurosurgical nosocomial bacterial meningitis has become an important clinical problem. The choice of appropriate empirical antibiotics is challenging and must be guided by an awareness of the relative frequency of various pathogens and the increasing incidence of resistant strains. Although high mortality rates may, in part, be related to the primary brain pathology, early diagnosis and the timely use of antibiotics based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing are essential for survival.
TI  - Outcome analysis of patients requiring mechanical ventilation with severe community-acquired pneumonia and identified bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with high mortality. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by the distribution of bacterial pathogens. The purpose of this study was to analyze the causative bacteria and outcomes of patients with severe CAP in a medical intensive care unit (MICU) in Taiwan. The results may provide a basis of guidance for future empirical antibiotic treatments. METHODS: We enrolled patients with severe CAP who were intubated and who required mechanical ventilation in an MICU in 2001. Only patients with identified bacterial pathogens were included. The bacterial distribution was determined, while differences in age, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores, and initial PaO2/FiO2 ratio between surviving and expired patients were compared. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were enrolled and 75 isolates were obtained. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common bacteria (21.3%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Staphylococcus aureus (8%) was the most-commonly isolated gram-positive organism, and half of its isolates were oxacillin-resistant (ORSA). The overall mortality was 55.9%. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that survivors had a significantly younger age and lower APACHE II scores. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli were the most-common causative pathogens among patients with severe CAP requiring mechanical ventilation. Antipseudomonal antibiotics or a carbapenem should be considered to cover Pseudomonas species, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains, and Acinetobacter species. If the isolated bacteria are gram-positive, care should be taken to cover the possibility of ORSA. Old age and higher APACHE II scores were associated with higher mortality.
TI  - Comparison of pharmacodynamic target attainment between healthy subjects and patients for ceftazidime and meropenem.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the pharmacodynamics of two beta-lactams--ceftazidime and meropenem--in healthy subjects versus patients. DESIGN: Monte Carlo simulation based on published pharmacokinetic studies. SUBJECTS: One hundred and ninety-seven participants (75 healthy volunteers and 122 patients) from published pharmacokinetic studies of ceftazidime or meropenem. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data on total body clearance and volume of distribution for ceftazidime and meropenem in healthy subjects and patients were obtained from published studies. Monte Carlo simulations were performed based on the pharmacokinetics from each study for ceftazidime 1000 mg every 8 hours and meropenem 1000 mg every 8 hours against isolates of Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Acinetobacter baumannii , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from North and South America. We calculated the likelihood of obtaining bactericidal exposures (50% time above the minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] for ceftazidime and 40% time above the MIC for meropenem) for each combination of pharmacokinetic study data and MIC distribution. Linear regression was used to compare target attainments for healthy subjects versus patients. Only three drug-pathogen combinations differed in target attainment between healthy subjects and patients: ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa in North America and meropenem against E. coli and P. aeruginosa in South America. The regression line of target attainment for patients versus healthy subjects had a slope of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.983-1.093) and a y intercept of -3.73 (95% CI -8.265-0.827, r2 = 0.992). The beta values for slope and intercept did not differ to a statistically significant extent between the regression line and the line of identity (p=0.264). CONCLUSION: The pharmacodynamic target attainment calculated with healthy subject pharmacokinetic data was predictive of patient target target attainment for ceftazidime and meropenem.
TI  - Update on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii infections in the healthcare setting.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are of great concern for hospitalized patients, especially with multidrug-resistant strains. This review focuses on recent data that may help us to understand the emergence, spread, and persistence of antibiotic resistance, and summarizes the optional treatment feasible for these resistant bacteria. RECENT FINDINGS: Multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii are increasingly causing nosocomial infections; multidrug-resistant clones are spreading into new geographic areas, and susceptible strains are acquiring resistance genes. New extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases are emerging, leading to pan-resistant strains. Current studies focus on the effect of antibiotics on gene expression in P. aeruginosa biofilms and their contribution to resistance to therapy. Treatment options for multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii infections are limited in most cases to carbapenems. Sulbactam is a treatment option for pan-resistant A. baumannii, and or renewed use of an old drug, colistin, is being entertained for pan-resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Immunotherapy is a promising new modality being explored. Prevention of emergence of resistance through combination therapy and pharmacokinetic strategies are studied. SUMMARY: The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii and their genetic potential to carry and transfer diverse antibiotic resistance determinants pose a major threat in hospitals. The complex interplay of clonal spread, persistence, transfer of resistance elements, and cell-cell interaction contribute to the difficulty in treating infections caused by these multidrug-resistant strains. In the absence of new antibiotic agents, new modalities of treatment should be developed.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of colistin in Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas infections: a prospective cohort study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess renal dysfunction and outcome in patients treated exclusively with colistin vs. other antibiotics. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective cohort study in a mixed ICU in a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: 185 patients infected with Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after an ICU stay longer than 48 h: 55 in the colistin group and 130 in the noncolistin group, similar in age, APACHE II, medical status, and SOFA score. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We recorded data on epidemiology and severity of illness, site of infection, renal function before and after treatment, clinical cure, and mortality. Clinical cure was defined as simultaneous normalization of central temperature (< or = 38 degrees), leukocyte count (< or = 10,000/mm3), and PaO2/FIO2 ratio (>187). Before treatment creatinine was 0.9+/-0.2 in the colistin group and 0.9+/-0.1 in the noncolistin group; after treatment the value was 1.0+/-0.3 in both groups. The most frequent infection was ventilator-associated pneumonia: 53% vs. 66% in colistin and noncolistin groups, respectively, Acinetobacter was the cause in 65% and 60% and Pseudomonas in 35% and 53%. In the noncolistin group 81% of patients were treated with carbapenems. Inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment was more frequent in the colistin group (100% vs. 8%), but there were no differences in the frequency of clinical cure on day 6 of treatment (15% and 17%) or in mortality (29% and 24%). CONCLUSIONS: Colistin appears to be as safe and as effective as other antimicrobials for treatment of sepsis caused by Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas in critically ill patients.
TI  - Clinical approach to the patient with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - Management of ventilator-associated pneumonia needs to balance the avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic overuse with the provision of adequate initial empiric therapy. A clinical diagnosis based on new pulmonary opacity and purulent respiratory secretions plus other signs of inflammation is valuable in screening for patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. A rational strategy starts with immediate initiation of adequate antibiotics and collection of respiratory secretions to evaluate the causative organism. As a minimum, an endotracheal aspirate with direct staining and quantitative cultures should be obtained. Overall, the need to choose adequate antibiotics correctly and expeditiously calls for the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the choice should be narrowed quickly in the light of microbiologic information. However, some patients (those who develop an infection within 5 days of hospitalization, those without recent antibiotic exposure, and those without hospitalization in the past 3 months) are at low risk of infection by resistant organisms. In that subset, adequate initial selection could be a non-pseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin, since antibiotics should target usual community-acquired organisms in addition to some Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus. Coverage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus should be limited only to intensive care units with concomitant index cases and to patients under antibiotic exposure. Patients at risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (e.g., 1 week of prior hospitalization or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) require initial use of a combination of piperacilin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin, or amikacin plus imipenem, meropenem, or an antipseudomonal cephalosporin. If risk of Acinetobacter baumannii exists, one of these agents should be a carbapenem. After 48 hours of therapy, each patient should be re-evaluated based mainly on resolution of hypoxemia and fever plus the initial microbiologic information. Whereas broad-spectrum therapy is initially warranted in many patients, this treatment may be narrowed considerably as culture results identify the causative organism and its sensitivity. Recent data suggest that reducing overall treatment duration to a maximum of 1 week is safe, effective and is less likely to promote the growth of resistant organisms in patients who are clinically improving. Optimal management should be based on a strategy combining early high doses of an effective agent for a short period of time, which is then simplified in the light of microbiologic information.
TI  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia in critically ill patients: factors associated with episodes due to imipenem-resistant organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy represents one of the factors associated with mortality of patients suffering from hospital-acquired pneumonia. According to its wide antimicrobial spectrum, imipenem belongs to the usual antibiotics proposed by current guidelines for such a therapy. However, major changes in the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacteria in the intensive care unit (ICU) have occurred. Our goal was to determine the incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to imipenem-resistant organism(s) in our ICU and to identify factors associated with such a resistance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1994 to December 2001, all consecutive patients admitted to our ICU for HAP or exhibiting HAP during their ICU stay were included in an observational cohort. Patients with a bacteriologically documented HAP were studied. For each causative pathogen, imipenem susceptibility was routinely determined. Patients with an HAP episode due to at least one imipenem-resistant causative organism were compared with patients who developed HAP in which all incriminated pathogens were imipenem susceptible. RESULTS: 235 patients were included in our observational cohort. Among them, 168 had an HAP episode with a bacteriologically proven infection. In 42 patients (25%), at least one causative organism was resistant to imipenem. The 44 imipenem-resistant organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 15), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 13), and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2). Multivariate analysis identified four significant independent factors associated with resistance of causative organism(s) to imipenem: prior use of a fluoroquinolone (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI: 1.8 to 8.8; p < 0.0001), prior use of an aminoglycoside (AOR = 2.6; CI: 1.2 to 5.9; p = 0.02), use of invasive blood pressure monitoring (AOR = 2.7; CI: 1.0 to 7.0; p = 0.04) and bilateral chest X-ray involvement (AOR = 2.6; CI: 1.1 to 5.8; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Factors associated with potential inadequacy of imipenem used as the single antibiotic for initial empiric treatment for HAP were identified. When they are present, imipenem should be either combined with antibiotics such as vancomycin and ciprofloxacin or replaced with another broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimen.
TI  - The role of the intensive care unit environment in the pathogenesis and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia is preceded by lower-respiratory-tract colonization by pathogenic microorganisms that derive from endogenous or exogenous sources. Most ventilator-associated pneumonias are the result of exogenous nosocomial colonization, especially, pneumonias caused by resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or by Legionella species or filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus. Exogenous colonization originates from a very wide variety of animate and inanimate sources in the intensive care unit environment. As a result, a strategic approach that combines measures to prevent cross-colonization with those that focus on oral hygiene and prevention of microaspiration of colonized oropharyngeal secretions should bring the greatest reduction in the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. This review examines strategies to prevent transmission of environmental pathogens to the vulnerable mechanically-ventilated patient.
TI  - Respiratory pathogens in dental plaque of hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases.
AB  - Bacterial cultivation studies have shown that dental plaque is a reservoir for respiratory pathogens in intensive care unit patients and in elderly who are debilitated, hospitalized or in a nursing home, placing them at risk of bacterial pneumonia. No information is available, however, concerning dental plaque as a reservoir of putative respiratory pathogens in hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases. Supragingival plaque colonization of 34 hospitalized chronic lung-diseased Romanian citizens, excluding those with tuberculosis and less than 20 teeth, was therefore assessed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization using a selected panel of whole genomic DNA probes produced from eight respiratory pathogens and eight oral pathogens. Thirty-one lung-healthy dental outpatients served as reference population. Respiratory pathogens were detected in plaque from 29 of the 34 (85.3%) hospitalized patients and 12 of the 31 (38.7%) reference population subjects. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacter cloacae occurred significantly (p<0.05) more frequent among the hospitalized patients. Hospitalized chronic lung-diseased patients harbored in their supragingival plaque samples bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia significantly (p<0.001) more frequent than lung-healthy dental outpatients. Our results indicate that dental plaque in patients with chronic lung diseases often serves as a reservoir of bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia in susceptible individuals.

TI  - Genetic environment and expression of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase blaPER-1 gene in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The genetic location of the gene coding for the expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase  PER-1 was analyzed in a series of gram-negative isolates. It was identified as part of a composite transposon bracketed by two novel insertion elements, ISPa12 and ISPa13, belonging to the IS4 family that possess transposases that share 63% amino acid identity and that are chromosomally located in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia stuartii, and Acinetobacter baumannii. On the contrary, the bla(PER-1) gene was identified just downstream of an ISPa12 element but not within a composite transposon when it was located on a plasmid in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and A. baumannii isolates. In both cases, expression of the bla(PER-1) gene was driven by promoter sequences located in ISPa12.
TI  - Colistin: the revival of polymyxins for the management of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria and the lack of new antibiotics to combat them have led to the revival of polymyxins, an old class of cationic, cyclic polypeptide antibiotics. Polymyxin B and polymyxin E (colistin) are the 2 polymyxins used in clinical practice. Most of the reintroduction of polymyxins during the last few years is related to colistin. The polymyxins are active against selected gram-negative bacteria, including Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species, and Enterobacter species. These drugs have been used extensively worldwide for decades for local use. However, parenteral use of these drugs was abandoned approximately 20 years ago in most countries, except for treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis, because of reports of common and serious nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Recent studies of patients who received intravenous polymyxins for the treatment of serious P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii infections of various types, including pneumonia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infections, have led to the conclusion that these antibiotics have acceptable effectiveness and considerably less toxicity than was reported in old studies.
TI  - Continuous infusion beta-lactams for intensive care unit pulmonary infections.
AB  - This study evaluated the pharmacodynamics of continuous infusion beta-lactams against pulmonary isolates of Gram-negative bacteria from patients managed in intensive care units (ICUs) in the USA. Multiple 10,000-patient Monte Carlo simulations were performed by integrating pharmacokinetic data from healthy individuals with 2408 MICs from the 2002 Intensive Care Unit Surveillance System database. These pharmacodynamic simulations suggested that continuous infusion regimens of cefepime, aztreonam, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam 13.5 g have the greatest likelihood of achieving pharmacodynamic targets against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae in the ICU. Beta-lactams are unlikely to achieve pharmacodynamic targets against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii when administered as monotherapy.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarises some of the notable papers on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) from January 2003 to October 2004. RECENT FINDINGS: Ventilator-associated pneumonia remains an important drain on hospital resources. All population groups are affected, but patients with VAP are more likely to be older, sicker, and male, with invasive medical devices in situ. Early VAP diagnosis is desirable to reduce VAP mortality and to retard emergence of multidrug-resistant microbes. This may be possible using preliminary culture results or intracellular organism in polymorphonuclear cells. In most intensive care units, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii are the commonest organisms isolated in VAP. However, causative organisms vary between and within hospitals. Consequently, individual intensive care units should develop empirical antibiotic policies to target the pathogenic bacteria prevalent in their patient populations. Preventative strategies aimed at reducing aerodigestive tract colonisation by pathogenic organisms, and also their subsequent aspiration, are becoming increasingly important. Educating medical staff about these simple measures is therefore pertinent. To reduce the occurrence of multidrug-resistant organisms, limiting the duration of antibiotic treatment to 8 days and antimicrobial rotation should be contemplated. Empirical therapy with antipseudomonal penicillins plus beta-lactamase inhibitors should be considered. If methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus VAP is a possibility, linezolid may be better than vancomycin. SUMMARY: Prevention remains the key to reducing VAP prevalence.
TI  - Risk factors of mortality for nosocomial pneumonia: importance of initial anti-microbial therapy.
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia is a common nosocomial infection and has high mortality rate. Risk factors of mortality of nosocomial pneumonia were studied in 132 hospitalised patients who developed nosocomial pneumonia. The overall mortality rate was 64/132, 48.5%. Of the 11 risk factors univariately associated with mortality due to nosocomial pneumonia, only the inappropriate initial anti-microbial therapy, high simplified acute physiology score and multiple organ failures remained significant after stepwise logistic regression. Gram-negative bacilli were still the most pre-dominant causative microbiologic agents of nosocomial pneumonia with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (18.6%) and Escherichia coli (5.9%) being the three most predominant pathogens. A. baumannii were significantly more predominant among non-survivors than survivors (13.56 vs. 5.08%, p=0.0418). The incidence rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 19.5% higher than previous reports. We conclude that inappropriate initial anti-microbial therapy for nosocomial pneumonia is associated with the mortality rate of nosocomial pneumonia, and appropriate anti-microbial therapy improves outcome of nosocomial pneumonia.
TI  - First-generation fluoroquinolone use and subsequent emergence of multiple drug-resistant bacteria in the intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between  fluoroquinolone (FQ) use and subsequent emergence of multiple drug-resistant bacteria (MRB) in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN: The authors conducted a prospective observational cohort study and a case control study. SETTING: The study was conducted in a 30-bed ICU. METHODS: All immunocompetent patients hospitalized for >48 hrs who did not receive antibiotics before ICU admission were eligible during a 15-month period. Routine MRB screening was performed at ICU admission and weekly thereafter. This screening included tracheal aspirate and nasal, anal, and axilla swabs. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine risk factors for MRB emergence in the ICU. In addition, a case control study was performed to determine whether FQ use is associated with subsequent emergence of MRB. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-nine patients were included; 108 ICU-acquired MRB were isolated in 77 patients. FQ use and longer duration of antibiotic treatment were identified as independent risk factors for MRB occurrence (odds ratio [95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.3 [1.7-6.5], 1.1 [1.0-1.2]; p < .001; respectively). One hundred thirty-five (56%) patients received FQ; matching was successful for 72 (53%) of them. Number of MRB (40 vs. 15 per 1,000 ICU days; p = .019) and percentage of patients with MRB (40% vs. 22%; OR [95% CI] = 1.5 [1.0-2.4]; p = .028) were significantly higher in cases than in controls. Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (26% vs. 12%; OR [95% CI] = 1.6 [.6-2.9]; p = .028) and extending-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli (11% vs. 1%; OR [95% CI] = 4.7 [0.7-30.2]; p = .017) rates were higher in cases than in controls, ceftazidime or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15% vs. 8%), Acinetobacter baumannii (1% vs. 5%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2% vs. 1%) rates were similar (p > .05) in case and control patients. CONCLUSION: FQ use and longer duration of antibiotic treatment are independently associated with MRB emergence. Reducing antimicrobial treatment duration and restricting FQ use could be suggested to control MRB spread in the ICU.
TI  - Aerosolized colistin for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in patients without cystic fibrosis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The clinical and economic consequences of the emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, combined with the high mortality rate among patients with nosocomial pneumonia, have stimulated a search for alternative therapeutic options to treat such infections. The use of adjunctive therapy with aerosolized colistin represents one of these. There is extensive experience with use of aerosolized colistin by patients with cystic fibrosis, but there is a lack of data regarding the use of aerosolized colistin in patients without cystic fibrosis. METHODS: We conducted the present study to assess the safety and effectiveness of aerosolized colistin as an adjunct to intravenous antimicrobial therapy for treatment of Gram-negative nosocomial pneumonia. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients hospitalized in a 450-bed tertiary care hospital during the period from October 2000 to January 2004, and who received aerosolized colistin as adjunctive therapy for multidrug-resistant pneumonia. RESULTS: Eight patients received aerosolized colistin. All patients had been admitted to the ICU, with mean Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores on the day of ICU admission and on day 1 of aerosolized colistin administration of 14.6 and 17.1, respectively. Six of the eight patients had ventilator-associated pneumonia. The responsible pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii (in seven out of eight cases) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (in one out of eight cases) strains. Half of the isolated pathogens were sensitive only to colistin. The daily dose of aerosolized colistin ranged from 1.5 to 6 million IU (divided into three or four doses), and the mean duration of administration was 10.5 days. Seven out of eight patients received concomitant intravenous treatment with colistin or other antimicrobial agents. The pneumonia was observed to respond to treatment in seven out of eight patients (four were cured and three improved [they were transferred to another facility]). One patient deteriorated and died from septic shock and multiple organ failure. Aerosolized colistin was well tolerated by all patients; no bronchoconstriction or chest tightness was reported. CONCLUSION: Aerosolized colistin may be a beneficial adjunctive treatment in the management of nosocomial pneumonia (ventilator associated or not) due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Is IS(ABA-1) customized for Acinetobacter?
AB  - An insertion sequence (IS(ABA-1)) was identified in Acinetobacter spp., but not in Enterobacteriacea and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Numerous copies of the IS were identified in Acinetobacter strains containing the element. In one of the Acinetobacter baumannii strains, IS(ABA-1) was identified adjacent to sulII and transcription of the resistance gene is presumed to be dependent on promoter sequences within the IS. Since the IS is adjacent to ampC and bla(OXA) in this A. baumannii strain, it may be that IS(ABA-1) plays an important role in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes in this genus.
TI  - Colistin treatment in patients with ICU-acquired infections caused by multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria: the renaissance of an old antibiotic.
AB  - A retrospective case series study was performed in a 30-bed general intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital to assess the effectiveness and safety of colistin in 43 critically ill patients with ICU-acquired infections caused by multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria. Various ICU-acquired infections, mainly pneumonia and bacteraemia caused by multiresistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Acinetobacter baumannii, were treated with colistin. Good clinical response (cure or improvement) was noted in 74.4% of patients. Deterioration of renal function occurred in 18.6% of patients during colistin therapy. Nephrotoxicity was elevated significantly in those patients with a history of renal failure (62.5%). All-cause mortality amounted to 27.9%. In this group of critically ill patients, an age of >50 years (OR, 5.4; 95% CI 1.3-24.9) and acute renal failure (OR, 8.2; 95% CI 2.9-23.8) were independent predictors of mortality. Colistin should be considered as a treatment option in critically ill patients with infection caused by multiresistant Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Use of colistin in the treatment of multiple-drug-resistant gram-negative infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: The use of colistin for the treatment of infections caused by multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative microorganisms was studied. METHODS: The efficacy of colistin for treating infections caused by MDR gram-negative microorganisms and the development of renal toxicity were studied in hospitalized adult patients in Spain. Patients treated between January 2001 and October 2001 were included. RESULTS: Over the study period, 71 courses of inhaled colistin, 12 courses of i.v. or intramuscular (i.m.) colistin, and 2 courses of intrathecal colistin were administered to 80 patients. All were infected by MDR organisms: 69 (86%) by Acinetobacter baumannii and 11 (14%) by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In 41 patients (51%), the episodes were caused by A. baumannii strains susceptible exclusively to colistin. The causative organisms were cleared in 92% of the patients from whom posttreatment repeat specimens were obtained. The in-hospital mortality rate was 18% (14 patients). There were no significant changes in mean serum urea or creatinine concentrations in patients receiving i.v. or i.m. therapy. CONCLUSION: Colistin was used in 80 patients infected with A. baumannii or P. aeruginosa and appeared to be efficacious and safe.
TI  - Emerging issues in the management of infections caused by multi-drug-resistant, gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The past decade has witnessed the continued emergence and spread of multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacilli. Infections caused by multi-drug-resistant, gram-negative bacilli lead, in many instances, to increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. METHODS: Recent literature from 1990 to the present is reviewed in order to put into perspective the effects of increasing incidences of multi-drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli on patient care. RESULTS: Factors important in the emergence and spread of multi-drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli include increasing severity of illness in hospitalized patients, poor attention to infection control practices by healthcare personnel, and the large, often indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Unlike earlier iterations, there is no steady stream of newer antimicrobial agents in development to address the problem. The only broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent with activity against multi-resistant, gram-negative bacilli and with potential to be licensed in the foreseeable future is tigecycline. Tigecycline, the first member of a novel class of antimicrobials, the glycylcyclines, is a structural derivative of minocycline, with potent activity against most gram-positive, gram-negative (excepting Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp.) and anaerobic species. Phase 3 trials indicate that tigecycline is effective for treating both complicated skin and skin structure infections, and intra-abdominal infections in hospitalized patients. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline promises to be an important addition to our monotherapy armamentarium, complementing essential efforts to promote compliance with good infection control measures and rational use of currently available antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Evaluation of colistin as an agent against multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Infections caused by multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are increasing worldwide. In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), resistance in P. aeruginosa to numerous anti-pseudomonal agents is becoming common. The absence since 1995, of new substances active against resistant Gram-negative bacteria, has caused increasing concern. Colistin, an old antibiotic also known as polymyxin E, has attracted more interest recently because of its significant activity against multi-resistant P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the low resistance rates to it. Because its use as an anti-pseudomonal agent was displaced by the potentially less toxic aminoglycosides in 1970s, our knowledge of this drug is limited. However, there has been a significant recent increase in the data gathered on colistin, focussing on its chemistry, antibacterial activity, mechanism of action and resistance, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and new clinical application. It is likely that colistin will be an important antimicrobial option against multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, for some years to come.
TI  - Assessment of the antibacterial activity of tea tree oil using the European EN 1276 and EN 12054 standard suspension tests.
AB  - The activity of tea tree oil (TTO) and TTO-containing products was investigated according to the EN 1276 and EN 12054 European suspension methods. The activity of different concentrations of TTO, a hygienic skin wash (HSW), an alcoholic hygienic skin wash (AHSW) and an alcoholic hand rub (AHR) was investigated. These formulations were assessed in perfect conditions with the EN 12054 test, and in perfect conditions as well as in the presence of interfering substances with the EN 1276 test, against Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With the latter test, the activity of the same formulations without TTO was also assessed as a control. With the EN 1276 test, the AHR achieved a >10(5)-fold reduction against all four test organisms within a 1-min contact time. The AHSW achieved a >or=10(5)-fold reduction against A. baumannii after a 1-min contact time and against S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa after a 5-min contact time. The efficacy of TTO appeared to be dependent on the formulation and the concentration tested, the concentration of interfering substances and, lastly, the organism tested. Nevertheless, 5% TTO achieved a >10(4)-fold reduction in P. aeruginosa cell numbers after a 5-min contact time in perfect conditions. TTO (5%) in 0.001% Tween 80 was significantly more active against E. coli and P. aeruginosa than against S. aureus and A. baumannii. With the EN 12054 test, after a 1-min contact time, 5% TTO in 0.001% Tween 80 and the AHSW achieved a >10(4)-fold reduction in E. coli and A. baumannii cell numbers, respectively, and the AHR achieved a >4 log10 reduction against all organisms tested. The formulations used in this study are now being tested using a novel ex vivo method as well as the in vivo European standard handwashing method EN 1499.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline against clinical isolates from Shanghai, China.
AB  - To evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in Shanghai, China were determined and compared with selected comparators. Results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. It was highly active against Gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Tigecycline also had good activity against most strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. However, it was poorly active against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic Gram-positive cocci such as Peptococcus spp. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. It was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic Gram-positive cocci. Tigecycline was bactericidal against all Gram-positive cocci tested except Enterococcus spp. Inoculum size but not pH of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. Aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in China may have some effects on MIC values of tigecycline.
TI  - The OPTAMA programme: utilizing MYSTIC (2002) to predict critical pharmacodynamic target attainment against nosocomial pathogens in Europe.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Optimising Pharmacodynamic Target Attainment using the MYSTIC (Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection) Antibiogram (OPTAMA) programme identifies antibiotic regimens with the highest probability of attaining critical pharmacodynamic targets, accounting for the inherent variability in pharmacokinetics, dosages and MIC distributions. METHODS: European MIC data were obtained from the MYSTIC programme. Pharmacodynamic target attainment was calculated by Monte Carlo simulation for meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: Significant differences in probability of target attainment were found, with Northern Europe demonstrating the highest probabilities of target attainment and Eastern Europe the lowest. The carbapenems had the highest target attainments and susceptibility levels across all regions and pathogens. The cephalosporins demonstrated high target attainments and susceptibility results against E. coli and K. pneumoniae in Northern and Southern Europe. Piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin had the lowest levels for both parameters in all regions. Desirable target attainment was not achieved (except for carbapenems in Northern Europe) for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa; thus, combination therapy may be appropriate empirical therapy for these pathogens in Southern and Eastern Europe. The closest correlations between target attainment and susceptibility were for meropenem 1 g every 8 h, imipenem 0.5 g every 6 h and ceftazidime 1 g every 8 h. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlighted significant overestimations between the probability of target attainment and the reported percentage susceptibility, particularly for piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. The approach of the OPTAMA programme provides a novel tool which complements susceptibility data to help in the selection of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Device-associated infections and patterns of antimicrobial resistance in a medical-surgical intensive care unit in a university hospital in Thailand.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance of nosocomial infection in the intensive care unit (ICU) received a high level of attention and outcome indicators are now used in benchmarking the quality of patient care. Since 1999 the surveillance has targeted three site-specific, device-associated infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central-line-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI), and catheter-related urinary tract infection (CR-UTI). The authors conducted a two-year prospective study on the incidences of these infections acquired in an ICU and report herein, together with the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the microorganisms isolated in an ICU. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Continuous prospective data collection was conducted on patients admitted to an adult medical-surgical ICU of a university hospital in Thailand from June 2000 to May 2002. RESULTS: A total 1422 patients with a total of 9370 patient-days were enrolled in the study. The incidence of VAP, CR-BSI, and CR-UTI were 10.8/1000 ventilator-days (95% C.I: 8.5-13.6), 2.6/1000 central-line-days (95%C.I. 1.5-4.4), and 13.8/1000 urinary-catheter-days (95%C.I: 10.7-17.5) respectively. The most common causative pathogens were Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, ceftazidime-resistant A. baumannii, third-generation-cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae, and quinolone-resistant E. coli were 68.8%, 30.9%, 68.5%, 44.6%, 38.3% respectively. CONCLUSION: The incidences of VAP and CR-BSI were comparable to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) report. But the incidence of CR-UTI was over the 90th percentile. The antibiotic resistance had become a serious problem.
TI  - Evaluation of three molecular typing techniques for nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate three different DNA techniques for typing nonfermentative  gram-negative bacilli isolated from Latin American hospitals. DESIGN: One hundred twenty-six nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli were typed. PARTICIPANTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 64) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 42) samples were obtained from blood cultures of patients admitted to 10 medical centers in Latin America during 1998 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 20) samples were obtained from patients admitted to the Hospital Sao Paulo between 1999 and 2001. METHODS: All samples were typed using automated ribotyping, PFGE, and ERIC-PCR. The discriminatory power for each technique was calculated using Hunter's generalized formula. RESULTS: All strains could be typed by automated ribotyping and ERIC-PCR, but two strains (1.6%) were not typeable by PFGE. All three techniques showed 100% reproducibility. The time to obtain the results was shorter for automated ribotyping and ERIC-PCR compared with PFGE. Likewise, the costs for ERIC-PCR and PFGE were lower than those for automated ribotyping. The interpretation of results was more complicated and more difficult with ERIC-PCR than with both PFGE and automated ribotyping. All techniques presented excellent discriminatory power for P. aeruginosa (0.98). PFGE presented the highest discriminatory power (0.94) for A. baumannii, and both PFGE and ERIC-PCR showed higher discriminatory power (0.90 for both) than automated ribotyping (0.82) for S. maltophilia. CONCLUSIONS: PFGE showed the highest discriminatory power for typing these nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. However, automated ribotyping and ERIC-PCR can provide results in a shorter time period with similar discriminatory power.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: VIRA study 2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the VIRA study carried out in 2001. METHODS: The 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in February 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (346), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and Acinetobacter baumannii (130). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). Global methicillin-resistance in S. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the E. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. One P. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the E-test MBL assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. The strains of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit: characteristics of early versus late onset.
AB  - Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of death in newborns despite sophisticated neonatal intensive care. This retrospective study reviewed the clinical characteristics of cases of culture-proven sepsis in a neonatal intensive care unit from January 1992 to December 2001. Patients were divided into those with onset of sepsis in the first 7 days of life (early-onset group) and those with onset after the seventh day of life (late-onset group). A total of 270 cases with 325 episodes of sepsis and 353 isolated pathogens were identified and included in the study. The male-to-female ratio was 1.4. The majority of cases of sepsis occurred in low birth weight (75.9%) and premature babies (76.7%). Late onset occurred in 71.9% of cases. Patients with late onset had a lower mortality rate than those with early onset (11.3% vs 28.9%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (20.1%) was the most common organism isolated, but infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was associated with the highest morality rate (55.0%). Late-onset sepsis was significantly more common in very low birth weight and premature infants. The most frequently encountered pathogens in the early-onset group were group B streptococci (GBS) and Escherichia coli, while in the late-onset group, the organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. GBS infection resulted in the highest mortality when the onset of sepsis was within the first 24 hours of life.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Microbiology and drug resistance mechanisms of fully resistant pathogens.
AB  - The acquisition of vancomycin resistance by Gram-positive bacteria and carbapenem resistance by Gram-negative bacteria has rendered some hospital-acquired pathogens impossible to treat. The resistance mechanisms employed are sophisticated and very difficult to overcome. Unless alternative treatment regimes are initiated soon, our inability to treat totally resistant bacteria will halt other developments in medicine. In the community, Gram-positive bacteria responsible for pneumonia could become totally resistant leading to increased mortality from this common infection, which would have a more immediate impact on our current lifestyles.
TI  - Monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  - The aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. Five University Clinics and/or Regional Hospitals in the Slovak Republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (19%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (13.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter sp. All CONS and S. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the CONS and only for 4% of S. aureus isolates. A higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in CONS in comparison to S. aureus. Enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against E. coli. Although 17% of K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against K. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. Gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against Enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Trends and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens causing bloodstream infections among febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancy.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The microbiological spectrum in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia has changed over the past several decades in western countries. The growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable consequence of the widespread use of antibiotics in medical settings. The aim of this study was to clarify the trends and antimicrobial resistance among pathogens causing bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancies. METHODS: The characteristics of pathogens causing bloodstream infection isolated from patients with febrile neutropenia who were treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from 1996 to 2001 were reviewed. A total of 1174 pathogens were isolated from 3093 admissions to a hematological ward during this period. Among them, 738 isolates were recovered from patients with febrile neutropenia. RESULTS: The majority (93%) of these neutropenic febrile patients had underlying acute leukemia or lymphoma. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 57% of isolated pathogens, followed by Gram-positive bacteria (32%), fungi (7%), and anaerobes (3%). In decreasing frequency, Escherichia coli (13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (5%) were the predominant Gram-negative bacteria, while coagulase-negative staphylococci (13%), viridans group streptococci (4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the major Gram-positive pathogens. Two-thirds (20/30) of S. aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. Resistance to cefotaxime was found in 63% of E. cloacae, 13% of K. pneumoniae and 10% of E. coli. Overall, 33% of E. coli and 13% of K. pneumoniae were resistant to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the microbiological spectrum of microorganisms causing bloodstream infections in neutropenic febrile patients with hematological malignancies at National Taiwan University Hospital is different from western countries in that Gram-negative bacteria remain the predominant pathogens. Antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens is high and E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin are increasing.
TI  - [Epidemiology and drug resistance of the pathogenic microbes in the complicated infection of hematological malignancies].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and drug resistance profile of the infection in patients with hematological malignancies. METHODS: All the microbe strains isolated from the department of hematology in Ruijin hospital between 1998 and 2002 were collected for the assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility and the results were analysed by WHONET5 software. RESULTS: Out of the 536 strains isolated in the department of hematology, 230 (42.9%) were Gram positive and 301 (56.2%) Gram negative organisms. The first 6 strains of Gram (-) microbes in frequent order were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter Baumannii and Stenotrophomonas (xantho) maltophi. The extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) producing rates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 27.3% and 33.3%, respectively. Methylcillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococcus (MRCNS) was the most prevalent Gram (+) bacteria in the complicated infection patients with hematological malignancies, which accounted for 88.5%. Carbapenems were most sensitive for all of the gram negative bacteria, with a drug resistance rate of 11.4 (5.0% approximately 15.8%) of imipenem. For ESBLs strains, carbapenems and cefapime were the best choice, with the resistance rate of 46.4% approximately 94.4% and 50.0% approximately 75.9%, respectively. The drug resistance rate of Acinetobacter Baumannii was 25.0% approximately 41.3% for the third generation cephalosporin, 22.7% for the fourth generation cephalosporin and 12.7% for imipenem. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to carbapenems, with a resistance rate of 12.7% of imipenem; however, it was more sensitive to the third generation cephalosporin. CONCLUSION: Antibiotics should be rationally administrated with more considerations to the characteristics of epidemiology and drug resistance profile of the microbes in the given department of hematology.
TI  - Procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity in ventilator-associated pneumonia: impact of inadequate antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the homeostatic balance of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with respect to the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive observational study in a 12-bed medical intensive care unit in a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-nine patients with VAP documented by quantitative culture of bronchoalveolar secretions and a control group of eight mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: Serial bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were assayed for prothrombin activation fragment (F1+2), thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex, fibrinolytic activity, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) on days 1, 4, and 7 after VAP onset. RESULTS: Pathogens isolated from patients with inadequate empirical antimicrobial coverage included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n=2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=4), and Acinetobacter baumannii (n=1). Compared to those who received adequate antibiotic therapy, TAT, F1+2, and PAI-1 levels increased while u-PA levels remained unchanged. Despite antibiotic adjustment on day 4, TAT levels remained elevated in those who lacked adequate antimicrobial coverage and were significantly correlated with PaO(2)/FIO(2). The procoagulant activity was accompanied by a local depression of fibrinolytic capacity that was attributed mainly to increased BALF PAI-1 levels. Nonsurvivors showed significantly higher levels of TAT and PAI-1 than survivors. No significant correlation between the bacterial burden and the homeostatic derangements was documented. CONCLUSIONS: The lung inflammatory response seems to promulgate a local procoagulant activity associated with hypoxemia in those with inadequate antibiotic therapy. The homeostatic derangement seems to be independent of the lung bacterial burden.
TI  - In vitro activity and potency of an intravenously injected antimicrobial peptide  and its DL amino acid analog in mice infected with bacteria.
AB  - We report that intravenous injection (3 mg/kg of body weight twice daily) of a diastereomer (containing 33% D amino acids) of an antimicrobial peptide, K6L9 (LKLLKKLLKKLLKLL-NH2), but not the all-L-amino-acid parental peptide, cures neutropenic mice infected with gentamicin-sensitive Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gentamicin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bacteria. Various biophysical experiments suggest a membranolytic-like effect.
TI  - Combination therapy with polymyxin B for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative respiratory tract infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms poses a therapeutic challenge. The use of polymyxin B has been resurrected specifically for this purpose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and microbiological efficacy, and safety profile of polymyxin B in the treatment of MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. Twenty-five critically ill patients received a total of 29 courses of polymyxin B administered in combination with another antimicrobial agent. RESULTS: Patients were treated with intravenous, and/or aerosolized polymyxin B. Mean duration of polymyxin B therapy was 19 days (range 2-57 days). End of treatment mortality was 21%, and overall mortality at discharge was 48%. Nephrotoxicity was observed in three patients (10%) and did not result in discontinuation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Polymyxin B in combination with other antimicrobials can be considered a reasonable and safe treatment option for MDR Gram-negative respiratory tract infections in the setting of limited therapeutic options.
TI  - Two consecutive outbreaks of Acinetobacter baumanii 1-a in a burn Intensive Care  Unit for adults.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumanii is generally a highly antibiotic resistant micro-organism  that can be easily transmitted between inpatients of ICUs. We report two consecutive outbreaks of A. baumanii in a burn ICU. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients with ICU-stay greater than 2 days were subject to a strict epidemiological surveillance after admission, recording age, sex, TSBA, etc. and follow-up data such as antibiotherapy, instrumentation, infections, etc. We also monitored the microbial flora evolution and their resistance to antibiotic by weekly cultures of pharynx, rectum, skin (healthy and burned), etc. Because of an "epidemic" microorganism, infection control procedures, were increased. We studied the colonization by other prevalent microorganisms: MR-S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: Seventy-two burn patients were followed in 1 year. Only 4.1% were infected at some site by A. baumanii, but 1/3 of patients were colonized by this microorganism, distributed in two outbreaks, one in the first trimester, after admission in the Unit of two non-burned and colonized patients (from another ICU). The second epidemic began in July and probably was due to transitory colonization of skin or fomites by health personnel working in both ICUs. All the isolates (from both ICUs) of A. baumanii were identical by PFGE. The length of hospital stay was the main risk factor for colonization. P. aeruginosa and MR-S. aureus showed a tendency to be endemo-epidemic at all times. CONCLUSION: Our cross colonization control measures showed a limited efficacy our burn patients. Therefore, we must impede the introduction to burn ICUs of epidemic microorganisms by colonized patients or heath personnel by restriction of admission of A. baumanii colonized patients from other ICUs (if the treatment can be administered in this ICU) and by strict disinfection/antiseptic procedures.
TI  - Resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  - This study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI). During a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. Fever higher than 38.5 degrees C was significantly more common in the bacteremic group than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. E. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic UTI than non-bacteremic UTI (73% vs 49%; p<0.01). Bacteria other than E. coli (i.e., K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Serratia marcescens, and Providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic UTI than bacteremic UTI (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). E. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). Isolates of P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. The emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic UTI in Taiwan. Further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial resistance on the outcome in these conditions.
TI  - Optimizing pharmacodynamic target attainment using the MYSTIC antibiogram: data collected in North America in 2002.
AB  - The OPTAMA Program is intended to examine typical antimicrobial regimens used in  the treatment of common nosocomial pathogens and the likelihood of these regimens attaining appropriate pharmacodynamic exposure in different parts of the world. A 5,000-subject Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate pharmacodynamic target attainment for meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Standard dosing regimens from North America were used. Pharmacokinetic parameter variability was derived from existing healthy volunteer data, and MIC data came from the 2002 MYSTIC Program. Ciprofloxacin displayed the lowest target attainment against all bacterial species (41 to 46% for A. baumannii, 53 to 59% for P. aeruginosa, and 80 to 85% for the Enterobacteriaceae). Increasing the dose to 400 mg every 8 h did not significantly increase target attainment against nonfermenters. Piperacillin-tazobactam target attainments were similar to that of ceftazidime against all pathogens. Higher doses of both compounds were needed to achieve better target attainments against P. aeruginosa. Overall, meropenem, imipenem, and cefepime attained the highest probabilities of attainment against the Enterobacteriaceae (99 to 100%). The carbapenems appear to be the most useful agents against A. baumannii (88 to 92%), and these agents, along with higher doses of any of the beta-lactams, would be the most appropriate choices for empirical therapy for P. aeruginosa infection. Given the lack of agreement between percent susceptibility and probability of target attainment for certain antimicrobial regimens, a methodology employing stochastic pharmacodynamic analyses may be a more useful tool for differentiating the most-optimal compounds and dosing regimens in the clinical setting of initial empirical therapy.
TI  - Integrons and beta-lactamases--a novel perspective on resistance.
AB  - The understanding of microbial resistance to the beta-lactam class of antibiotics in the form of beta-lactamases has come a long way since the early discoveries of narrow-spectrum penicillinases. Integron-borne beta-lactamases co-occurring with a wide array of non-beta-lactam resistance genes, particularly pose an increasing threat to the nosocomial environment, giving rise to multi-drug resistant microbes with complex resistance patterns. Selection of potent beta-lactamases through the use of non-beta-lactam agents may be possible through integron-mediated resistance. It has become imperative that we should continuously strive to understand these complex mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, not only to overcome them, but to avoid them from evolving further.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic comparisons of antimicrobials against nosocomial isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa from the MYSTIC surveillance program: the OPTAMA Program, South America 2002.
AB  - The OPTAMA (Optimizing Pharmacodynamic Target Attainment using the MYSTIC [Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection] Antibiogram) Program provides insight into the appropriate antibiotic options for empiric therapy for common nosocomial pathogens. In this report, South America is represented by Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela. A 5000-subject Monte Carlo Simulation estimated pharmacodynamic target attainment for meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pharmacokinetic parameter variability was derived from existing healthy volunteer data, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data came from the 2002 MYSTIC program. Piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin displayed the lowest target attainment against all bacterial species (14% to 24% for A. baumannii, 26% to 37% for P. aeruginosa, and 48% to 66% for the Enterobacteriaceae). Overall, the carbapenems had the highest probabilities of attainment against the Enterobacteriaceae (98% to 100%) and A. baumannii (73% to 74%), whereas cefepime obtained the greatest target attainment against P. aeruginosa (65%). Because no single regimen had high target attainment against A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, the use of combination therapy to treat these pathogens in South America may be justified. Because of the lack of agreement with percent susceptibility for certain antimicrobial regimens, the use of pharmacodynamic target attainment may be a more accurate predictor of microbiologic success.
TI  - Antiseptic impregnated endotracheal tubes for the prevention of bacterial colonization.
AB  - The effect of endotracheal tubes (ETTs) impregnated with chlorhexidine (CHX) and  silver carbonate (antiseptic ETTs) against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacter aerogenes [organisms associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)], was evaluated in a laboratory airway model. Antiseptic ETTs and control ETTs (unimpregnated) were inserted in culture tubes half-filled with agar media (airway model) previously contaminated at the surface with 10(8) cfu/mL of the selected test organism. After five days of incubation, bacterial colony counts on all ETT segments were determined. Swabs of proximal and distal ends of the agar tract in antiseptic and control models were subcultured. The initial and residual CHX levels, (five days post-implantation in the model) were determined. Cultures of antiseptic ETTs revealed colonization by the tested pathogens ranging from 1-100 cfu/tube, compared with approximately 10(6) cfu/tube for the control ETTs (P < 0.001). Subcultures from proximal and distal ends of the agar tract showed minimal or no growth in the antiseptic ETTs compared with the control ETTs (P < 0.001). The amount of CHX retained in the antiseptic ETTs after five days of implantation was an average of 45% of the initial level. Antiseptic ETTs prevented bacterial colonization in the airway model and also retained significant amounts of the antiseptic. These results indicate that the effectiveness of antiseptic-impregnated ETTs in preventing the growth of bacterial pathogens associated with VAP may vary with different organisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro and in vivo study of nine alcohol-based handrubs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hygienic hand disinfection using alcohol-based handrubs (AHRs) is an  alternative method to conventional handwashing in hospital wards. Because a documented choice of such products would consider data from in-care evaluation, we designed a comparative study of 9 AHRs both in vitro and in vivo in actual care conditions. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of AHRs was first measured in vitro against 4 hospital strains exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance: Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter aerogenes. In a second time, AHRs were tested in an intensive care unit for antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of personnel hands and for acceptance by the care personnel. RESULTS: The 9 AHRs could be classified in 3 groups on the basis of their in vitro activity: products of the first group showed a bactericidal activity higher than 4 log(10) against the 4 strains. Only 1 of these products presented simultaneously an effective antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of care personnel hands and a good acceptance by the care personnel. CONCLUSION: The in vitro study allowed the differentiation of the AHRs tested on the basis of bactericidal activity, but evaluation in an in-care situation allowed further discrimination through both antibacterial activity and acceptance. Thus, the combination of in vitro and in vivo evaluations should provide helpful arguments in the choice of AHRs.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli isolated from the respiratory tracts of Italian inpatients: a 3-year surveillance study by the Italian Epidemiological Survey.
AB  - The Italian Epidemiological Survey evaluated antibiotic susceptibility of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatient respiratory-tract specimens collected throughout Italy during 1997-1999. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of 14 antibiotics for 1474 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 307 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains and 114 Acinetobacter baumannii strains were determined in 57 clinical microbiology laboratories by means of a standardised micro-dilution method. The most active drugs against P. aeruginosa isolates were meropenem (81% susceptible) and amikacin (80% susceptible). Imipenem and meropenem proved to be the only agents active against A. baumannii isolates, although 13 and 16%, respectively, of strains were resistant to these drugs. Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) showed activity only against S. maltophilia isolates (83% susceptible). A total of 185 multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates (resistant to piperacillin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, and imipenem) were found. Resistance rates and trends showed consistent regional variations, including sharp increases from 1997 to 1999 in imipenem resistance among P. aeruginosa isolates from central and southern Italy.
TI  - Determination of minimal regrowth concentration (MRC) in clinical isolates of various biofilm-forming bacteria.
AB  - Based on the ability to attach to polymeric surfaces, the formation of biofilms was determined in 5 wild-type strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus warneri). Using modified Christensen method, minimum regrowth concentration (MRC) of piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoperazon, ceftazidim, cefepim, meronem, ciprofloxacin, netilmicin and amikacin for Gram-negative and of ampicillin-sulbactam, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, clindamycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin for Gram-positive bacteria was estimated in trypticase-soy broth medium after a 1-d growth on polystyrene microtiter plates. Adherent bacterial populations exhibited reduced antimicrobial susceptibility, which was not shown in submerged cultures. Our results indicate that MRC can predict therapeutic outcome of antibiotic treatment better than the minimum inhibitory concentration tests commonly used.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in a general surgical ward].
AB  - According to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system we analysed the post-surgical nosocomial infections in a surgery ward of Perugia University. Between May 2000 and April 2001, 677 patients were enrolled mean age 51.5 years: 355 (52%) male, 462 (68%) ASA score 1, "clean" surgery in 355 cases (52%), cephazolin prophylaxis in 256 (38%); 11 (2%) patients deceased perioperatively. A total of 37 nosocomial infections, in 33 patients, were detected: 18 pneumonia (48.6%), 10 surgical site infections (27%) with 18 isolated: 12 gram-negative (E. coli 3, Acinetobacter baumannii 2, Providencia stuartii 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2, Achromobacter spp. 1, Citrobacter freundii 1, Morganella morgani 1) and 6 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus meticillin resistant 3, Enterococcus faecalis 2, Streptococcus salivarius 1); 7 sepsis (19%) due to 7 gram-positive (S. aureus meticillin resistant 4, S. aureus meticillin susceptible 1, Staphylococcus coagulase negative 1, Clostridium spp 1), 2 urinary tract infections (5.4%). Patients without infections and with nosocomial infections spent in hospital 6.3 and 16.6 days respectively. We can image that in one year 53 surgical procedure were lost, with a lost gain of 79.500-291.500 euro/year.
TI  - The status of antimicrobial resistance in Taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the Taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (TSAR) program, 2000.
AB  - In a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (Taiwan Surveillance of  Antimicrobial Resistance, TSAR), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers and regional hospitals throughout Taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (TSAR II). This report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii) in the TSAR II collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (TSAR I) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. Resistance of the 5 Enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in Taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in E. coli, 68% in P. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in K. pneumonia to 66% in S. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in K. pneumoniae to 70% in P. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. Resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in Taiwan than most Western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant A. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli (12%). Differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in TSAR II; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout Taiwan.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens isolated from a new regional hospital in southern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance has become a major health problem in Taiwan. While some trends in antimicrobial resistance are universal, others appear to be unique for specific regions. METHODS: To determine the distribution and antimicrobial drug resistance of bacterial pathogens in a new hospital in southern Taiwan, surveillance data on major bacterial pathogens isolated from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Chia-Yi from January 2002 through December 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The most common gram-positive isolate was Staphylococcus aureus. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the two most common gram negative isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the first among gram-negative, glucose non-fermenting isolates, followed in the order of frequency by Acinetobacter baumannii. Oxacillin resistance rate of S. aureus was 58%, while vancomycin and teicoplanin remained effective against all of the isolates. The penicillin non-susceptibility rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 52%, and it is notable that the rate of resistance to erythromycin was 87%. Resistance to various antimicrobial agents for P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, and gram-negative enteric bacilli was very common in our study. Infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii was not uncommon in this hospital but fortunately, imipenem resistant A. baumannii was rarely encountered. Antimicrobial resistance was common in nontyphoid Salmonella, S. choleraesuis and serogroup B isolates in particular. CONCLUSION: The high rates of antimicrobial resistance among these major bacterial pathogens in this new hospital are impressive and alarming. Judicious use of antimicrobial agents can never be overemphasized. Continued surveillance of the changes of resistance patterns over time is necessary.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of bacterial ventilator-associated pneumonia in surgical intensive care units.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common infection in intensive care units. It is caused by prolonged hospitalization and results in high mortality rates. This retrospective clinical study, of 140 patients in a surgical intensive care unit, aimed to identify the bacterial agents responsible for VAP infection, and determine antibiotic resistance rates in VAP. Antibiotic sensitivity was evaluated by culturing and testing tracheal aspirates from patients with clinical and radiological findings of VAP. The bacteria isolated most frequently were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (30.0%), Acinetobacter baumannii (26.1%), and Enterobacter species (4.3%). A. baumannii was more prevalent than in previous years. The results of antibiotic sensitivity testing suggested sulbactam/cefoperazone as the most appropriate drug for treating these patients. We suggest, however, that when staphylococcal pneumonia is suspected, a glycopeptide (vancomycin or teicoplanin) or combined trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is used as first-line therapy until sensitivity results are obtained. In conclusion, development of antibiotic policies for individual hospitals can reduce high antibiotic resistance rates due to VAP.
TI  - Epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) in infants in a pediatric surgical ICU after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult ICUs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of NP in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. METHODS: Data were collected between June 1999 and June 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. RESULTS: Of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired NP after cardiac surgery. The incidence of NP was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (CHD) compared to simple CHD (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). The proportion of late-onset NP was higher in patients with complex CHD (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). A total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and Gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). The main GNB were Acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen GNB were Flavobacterium meningosepticum (7 isolates, 8.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), Escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and Xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). The most commonly seen Gram-positive cocci were Staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). The frequent fungi were Candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). Most GNB were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. The bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from K pneumoniae and E coli; the susceptibility of ESBL-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. There were one case of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant S epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. From 1999 to 2002 in infants with NP after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant GNB such as A baumanii, P aeruginosa, and K pneumoniae. However, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in Gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. Early onset episodes of NP were frequently caused by Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive S aureus, and other susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset NP, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, other multiresistant GNB, MRSA, and fungi were the predominant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in NP in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of Gram-positive pathogens as reported by several adult ICUs. GNB still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years in our hospital. There was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem against Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem, both  administered as 500 mg every 6 hours, against populations of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. DESIGN: Ten thousand-subject Monte Carlo simulation. INTERVENTION: Variability in total body clearance (ClT), volume of distribution as calculated by the terminal elimination rate (Vdbeta), and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa) were derived from the literature for both meropenem and imipenem. For the free drug concentrations, the percentage of the dosing interval that the drug concentrations remain above the MIC (%T>MIC) for each carbapenem-bacteria combination was calculated for 10,000 iterations, substituting a different ClT, Vdbeta, fraction of unbound drug, and MIC into the equation each time based on the probability distribution for each parameter. Probabilities of attaining targets of 30%, 50%, and 100% T>MIC were calculated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Meropenem free drug %T>MIC exposure was significantly greater than that of imipenem against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, whereas imipenem exposure was greater for A. baumannii. For both agents, free drug %T>MIC exposure was greatest against Enterobacteriaceae and less for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Probabilities of target attainment for 30% and 50% T>MIC were similar between drugs for most bacteria. At 100% T>MIC, meropenem target attainments were greater than those of imipenem against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, and imipenem attainment was higher for A. baumannii. CONCLUSION: The probability of attaining lower pharmacodynamic targets for most gram-negative bacteria is similar for these carbapenems; however, differences become apparent as the pharmacodynamic requirement increases. Further study of the benefits of achieving this pharmacodynamic breakpoint with a higher probability of attaining targets is necessary.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - Attachment to and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces by Acinetobacter baumannii: involvement of a novel chaperone-usher pili assembly system.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii causes severe infections in compromised patients, survives on abiotic surfaces in hospital environments and colonizes different medical devices. In this study the analysis of the processes involved in surface attachment and biofilm formation by the prototype strain 19606 was initiated. This strain attaches to and forms biofilm structures on plastic and glass surfaces, particularly at the liquid-air interface of cultures incubated stagnantly. The cell aggregates, which contain cell stacks separated by water channels, formed under different culture conditions and were significantly enhanced under iron limitation. Electron and fluorescence microscopy showed that pili and exopolysaccharides are part of the cell aggregates formed by this strain. Electron microscopy of two insertion derivatives deficient in attachment and biofilm formation revealed the disappearance of pili-like structures and DNA sequencing analysis showed that the transposon insertions interrupted genes with the highest similarity to hypothetical genes found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Although the products of these genes, which have been named csuC and csuE, have no known functions, they are located within a polycistronic operon that includes four other genes, two of which encode proteins related to chaperones and ushers involved in pili assembly in other bacteria. Introduction of a copy of the csuE parental gene restored the adherence phenotype and the presence of pili on the cell surface of the csuE mutant, but not that of the csuC derivative. These results demonstrate that the expression of a chaperone-usher secretion system, some of whose components appear to be acquired from unrelated sources, is required for pili formation and the concomitant attachment to plastic surfaces and the ensuing formation of biofilms by A. baumannii cells.
TI  - PCR typing of genetic determinants for metallo-beta-lactamases and integrases carried by gram-negative bacteria isolated in Japan, with focus on the class 3 integron.
AB  - From January 2001 to December 2002, 587 strains of gram-negative bacterial isolates demonstrating resistance to ceftazidime and a combination of sulbactam and cefoperazone were subjected to a disk diffusion screening test using sodium mercaptoacetic acid; 431 strains (73.4%) appeared to produce metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL). Of these 431 strains, 357 were found by PCR to carry genes for IMP-1 type MBL (bla(IMP-1)), while only 7 and 67 strains carried the IMP-2 gene (bla(IMP-2)) and the VIM-2 gene (bla(VIM-2)), respectively. Neither VIM-1 nor SPM-1 type MBL genes were found among the strains tested. Of 431 strains, 427 carried the intI1 gene, and 4 strains carrying both the intI1 and intI3 genes were reidentified as Pseudomonas putida harboring bla(IMP-1). Of these four P. putida strains, three strains and one strain, respectively, were separately isolated from two hospitals located in the same prefecture, and the three strains showed very similar pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Of 357 bla(IMP-1) carriers, 116, 53, 51, 47, and 30 strains were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, P. putida/fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, respectively. Four strains carrying bla(IMP-2) were reidentified as P. putida. Sixty-three P. aeruginosa strains and four P. putida strains carried bla(VIM-2). Of 427 intI1-positive strains, 180, 53, 51, 47, and 35 were identified as P. aeruginosa, A. xylosoxidans, P. putida/fluorescens, S. marcescens, and A. baumannii, respectively. In the present study, it was confirmed that strains carrying bla(IMP-1) with a class 1 integron are the most prevalent type in Japan, although several intI3 carriers have also been identified sporadically in this country.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in a multi-hospital system: differences in microbiology by location.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there were differences in the microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia in different clinical settings. DESIGN: Observational retrospective cohort study of microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia from 1998 to 2001 in a multi-hospital system. Microbiologic results were compared between hospitals and between different intensive care units (ICUs) within hospitals. SETTING: Three hospitals--one pediatric teaching hospital, one adult teaching hospital, and one community hospital--in one healthcare system in the midwestern United States. PATIENTS: Patients at the target hospitals who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia and for whom microbiologic data were available. RESULTS: Seven hundred fifty-three episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia had culture data available for review. The most common organisms at all hospitals were Staphylococcus aureus (28.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25.2%). The pediatric hospital had higher proportions of Escherichia coli (9.5% vs 2.3%; P < .001) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (13% vs 3.1%; P < .001) than did the adult hospitals. In the pediatric hospital, the pediatric ICU had higher P aeruginosa rates than did the neonatal ICU (33.3% vs 17%; P = .01). In the adult hospitals, the surgical ICU had higher Acinetobacter baumannii rates (10.2% vs. 1.7%; P < .001) than did the other ICUs. CONCLUSIONS: Microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia vary between and within hospitals. Knowledge of these differences can improve selection of initial antimicrobial regimens, which may decrease mortality.
TI  - A comparison of the antimicrobial resistance patterns of gram-negative bacilli isolated from community-private and university-affiliated hospitals from Puerto Rico.
AB  - Few studies have been performed in Puerto Rico concerning the antimicrobial resistance pattern of clinically significant Gram-negative bacilli. The antimicrobial resistance patterns of 5,590 Gram-negative bacteria obtained from three Community-Private Hospitals (CPH) and three University-Affiliated Hospitals (UAH) were evaluated utilizing the institutions' antimicrobial susceptibility reports for the year 2000. The objectives of this study were: to retrospectively evaluate the reported in vitro resistance of clinical isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii to selected standard antibiotics and to compare the antimicrobial resistance patterns between Community-Private (CPH) and University Affiliated hospitals (UAH). E. coli was the most common Gram-negative enteric bacilli in both CPH and UAH. In UAH, E. coli demonstrated a statistically significant higher resistance to the selected beta lactams and amikacin antibiotics but not to ciprofloxacin or gentamicin. For K. pneumoniae, the antimicrobial resistant pattern showed that UAH isolates were significantly more resistant to the tested antibiotics with the exception of ceftriaxone. In CPH, E. cloacae isolates were significantly more resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, while in UAH this organism was more resistant to amikacin. In UAH, S. marcescens isolates demonstrated a statistically significant higher resistance to all tested antibiotics with the exception of imipenem, which was similar in both hospitals group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated a statistically significant higher resistance in UAH to all selected antibiotics with the exception of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, which was similar in both hospitals group. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant organisms in both hospitals group. UAH isolates were significantly more resistant than CPH isolates for all tested antibiotics. When compare with other large-scale antimicrobial resistance studies, the present study results suggest an apparent higher resistance in the Puerto Rican isolates. The high numbers of antimicrobial resistant Gram-negative bacilli in our study strongly suggest multiple mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance including the presence of extended spectrum and chromosomally derepressed beta-lactamases.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of piperacillin, piperacillin-sulbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam against nosocomial pathogens isolated from intensive care patients.
AB  - We investigated the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin-tazobactam versus piperacillin-sulbactam against common nosocomial pathogens (n = 565) isolated from intensive care patients. For Gram-positive bacteria, antimicrobial susceptibilities to the two piperacillin-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations were almost identical. For Gram-negative bacteria, piperacillin-tazobactam exhibited greater activity against Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris than piperacillin-sulbactam. Both combinations, however, were equally effective against the other Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Piperacillin-sulbactam exhibited better antimicrobial activity against Acinetobacter baumannii. Our findings might prove important for the appropriate choice of antibiotic therapy with beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
TI  - Pneumonia in the intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To update the state-of-the-art on pneumonia in adult patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), with special emphasis on new developments in management. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, using the following keywords: hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia, diagnosis, therapy, prevention. RESULTS: Interventions to prevent pneumonia in the ICU should combine multiple measures targeting the invasive devices, microorganisms, and protection of the patient. Once pneumonia develops, the appropriateness of the initial antibiotic regimen is a vital determinant of outcome. Three questions should be formulated: a) Is the patient at risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus?; b) Is Acinetobacter baumannii a problem in the institution?; and c) is the patient at risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa? Antibiotic therapy should be started immediately and must circumvent pathogen-resistance mechanisms developed after previous antibiotic exposure. Therefore, antibiotic choice should be institution specific and patient oriented. Microbiologic investigation is useful on evaluating the quality of the respiratory sample and permits early modification of the regimen in light of the microbiologic findings. CONCLUSION: A decision tree outlining an approach to the evaluation and management of ventilator-associated pneumonia is provided.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative organisms in the intensive care unit.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review the hospital-acquired gram-negative organisms commonly encountered among patients in the intensive care unit and discuss pertinent surveillance data, resistance mechanisms and patterns, and optimal treatment regimens for these pathogens. RECENT FINDINGS: There has been a notable increase in antibiotic resistance among gram-negative intensive care unit pathogens. Data from surveillance programs such as National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System, Intensive Care Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology, and others have documented undesirable trends in antibiotic resistance, indicating decreasing efficacy of antibiotic classes such as third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones, The increased prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases has contributed to the finding of multidrug resistance among bacteria such as Klebsiella and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, organisms such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia display intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics, making selection of optimal therapy difficult. Studies have correlated infection by these organisms with prior antibiotic exposure, and containment of the spread of infection can be achieved by careful antibiotic use and infection control practices. SUMMARY: Antibiotic resistance continues to rise among hospital-acquired gram-negative pathogens. Optimal management of these infections requires knowledge of local epidemiology and practices to control their spread.
TI  - Intravenous colistin in the treatment of sepsis from multiresistant Gram-negative bacilli in critically ill patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The increasing prevalence of multiresistant Gram-negative strains in intensive care units (ICUs) has recently rekindled interest in colistin, a bactericidal antibiotic that was used in the 1960s for treatment of infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli. We conducted the present observational study to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous colistin in the treatment of critically ill patients with sepsis caused by Gram-negative bacilli resistant to all other antibiotics. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Critically ill patients with sepsis caused by Gram-negative bacilli resistant to all antibiotics with the exception of colistin were treated in the six-bed ICU of a trauma hospital. Diagnosis of infection was based on clinical data and isolation of bacteria, and the bacteria were tested with respect to their susceptibility to colistin. Clinical response to colistin was evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (mean age 44.3 years, mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 20.6) received 26 courses of colistin. Clinical response was observed for 73% of the treatments. Survival at 30 days was 57.7%. Deterioration in renal function was observed in 14.3% of 21 patients who were not already receiving renal replacement therapy, but in only one case did this deterioration have serious clinical consequences. CONCLUSION: The lack of a control group in the present study does not allow any definite conclusions to be drawn regarding the clinical effectiveness of colistin. On the other hand, this drug has an acceptable safety profile and its use should be considered in severe infections with multiresistant Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Outbreak of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase VEB-1-producing isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii in a French hospital.
AB  - Twelve clonally related and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates  were recovered during a 4-month period from 12 patients hospitalized at the Valenciennes Hospital in France. Antibiograms determined by the double-disk diffusion technique on cloxacillin-containing plates detected a clavulanic acid-inhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). PCR and sequencing identified the gene encoding the Ambler class A ESBL VEB-1. This gene was located on the chromosome and was part of a class 1 integron identical to that previously identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Thailand. Additionally, seven clonally related bla(VEB-1)-positive A. baumannii strains were identified in the immediate environment of the hospitalized patients. This is the first report of the ESBL VEB-1 in Acinetobacter spp. and the first description of VEB-1-producing strains as a source of an outbreak occurring outside Southeast Asia. This report underlines the difficulty of the identification of ESBLs in A. baumannii.
TI  - Polymyxin B nephrotoxicity and efficacy against nosocomial infections caused by multiresistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Reported rates of nephrotoxicity associated with the systemic use of polymyxins have varied widely. The emergence of infections due to multiresistant gram-negative bacteria has necessitated the use of systemic polymyxin B once again for the treatment of such infections. We retrospectively investigated the rate of nephrotoxicity in patients receiving polymyxin B parenterally for the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant gram-negative bacteria from October 1999 to September 2000. Demographic and clinical information was obtained for 60 patients. Outcome measures of interest were renal toxicity and clinical and microbiologic efficacy. Renal failure developed in 14% of the patients, all of whom had normal baseline renal function. Development of renal failure was independent of the daily and cumulative doses of polymyxin B and the length of treatment but was significantly associated with older age (76 versus 59 years, P = 0.02). The overall mortality was 20%, but it increased to 57% in those who developed renal failure. The organism was cleared in 88% of the patients from whom repeat specimens were obtained. The use of polymyxin B to treat multiresistant gram-negative infections was highly effective and associated with a lower rate of nephrotoxicity than previously described.
TI  - The influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome. METHODS: From June 1995 to January 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant ICU-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. Clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. We defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the SPSS package (9.0). RESULTS: Among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. In this last group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. Bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. Eleven percent developed septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. The main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%), respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). The microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Candida species (4.5% each). The frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.10-6.21; P = 0.015). The global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. The only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (P = 0.04; OR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.12-0.97). Septic shock was related to attributable mortality (P = 0.03; OR = 3.19; 95% CI: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (P = 0.24; OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 0.66-4.78). CONCLUSION: Almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. This fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently isolated and the source of the bacteremia.
TI  - The threat from the pink corner.
AB  - In terms of numbers of isolates, the greatest present resistance problems arise with gram-positive pathogens (which stain purple/black in Gram's method), especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). But, is the MRSA problem--by its size--blinding us to something ultimately more dangerous: the slow emergence of gram-negative pathogens (which stain pink) with resistance to all reliable antibiotics? Although presently rare, 'pan-resistant' gram-negative bacteria--predominantly strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii--have more comprehensive resistance than any gram-positive pathogen. They already pose treatment problems in compromised hospital patients, especially in specialist units, as well in particular groups, such as cystic fibrosis patents. Disturbingly, there is a near-total lack of developmental antibiotics active against gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamase among Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in a Korean university hospital and comparison of screening methods for detecting metallo-beta-lactamase.
AB  - To identify the metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) prevalent in Korea, a total of 130 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii (99 P. aeruginosa and 31 A. baumannii) with a reduced susceptibility to imipenem (IPM) and/or ceftazidime (CAZ) was subjected to PCR analyses with primers specific to bla(IMP-1), bla(VIM-1), and bla(VIM-2). In addition, inhibitor-potentiated disk diffusion methods (IPD) using two kinds of substrate-inhibitor combinations (ceftazidime-2-mercaptopropionic acid (2MPA) and imipenem-EDTA) were investigated. Thirty-three isolates (29 P. aeruginosa and 4 A. baumannii) carried bla(VIM-2) and two P. aeruginosa isolates harbored bla(IMP-1). The enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR (ERIC-PCR) pattern revealed that many of the VIM-2-producing P. aeruginosa isolates were clonally related, whereas the A. baumannii isolates were diverse. The inhibitor-potentiated disk diffusion test using imipenem-EDTA was highly sensitive and specific for detecting the VIM-2 producer. These results suggest that VIM-2 is an important MBL in P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii in the Korean hospital of this study and that the IMP-1-producing P. aeruginosa has also emerged. Screening for MBLs and strict infection control for these isolates will contribute to prevent further spread of resistance.
TI  - Criteria of time and antibiotic susceptibility in the elimination of duplicates when calculating resistance frequencies.
AB  - We studied the effects of various systems of eliminating repeat isolates on the absolute number and susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus isolates over a 2 year period. The criterion of time is objective and reproducible, whereas that of variation in antibiotic susceptibility detects variations in the susceptibility of microorganisms that acquire resistance during treatment, but may be affected by methodological errors in determining the antibiotic susceptibility. These tools are useful in the control of multi-resistant bacteria and enable the true situation regarding antibiotic resistance in each geographical area to be determined.
TI  - Impact of antibiotic-resistant pathogens colonizing the respiratory secretions of patients in an extended-care area of the emergency department.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of acquired infection, and the incidence, risk factors, and molecular typing of multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms (MROs) colonizing respiratory secretions or the oropharynx of patients in an extended-care area of the emergency department (ED) in a tertiary-care university hospital. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted regarding risk factors for colonization with MROs in ED patients from July 1996 to August 1998. The most prevalent MRO strains were determined using plasmid and genomic analysis with PFGE. RESULTS: MROs colonized 59 (25.4%) of 232 ED patients and 173 controls. The mean ED length of stay for the 59 cases was 13.9 days versus 9.8 days for the 173 controls. The mean length of stay prior to the first isolation of MROs was 9.9 days. MRO species included Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The rate of hospital-acquired infection was 32.7 per 1,000 ED patient-days. The case fatality rate was significantly higher for cases. Univariate analysis identified mechanical ventilation, nebulization, nasogastric intubation, urinary catheterization, antibiotic therapy, and number of antibiotics as risk factors for MRO colonization. Multivariate regression analysis found that mechanical ventilation and nasogastric intubation independently predicted MRO colonization. Endemic clones were identified by PFGE in ED patients and were also found in patients in other parts of the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged stay in the ED posed a risk for colonization with MROs and for contracting nosocomial infections, both of which were associated with increased mortality. Patients colonized with antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii may serve as a reservoir for spread in this hospital.
TI  - Considerations in control and treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - We sought to control infection due to multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-Ab) by identifying isolates as clonally related, leading to enhanced infection-control measures, including cohorting, surveillance, contact precaution, initial therapy with ampicillin/sulbactam and local polymyxin B, and, more recently, therapy with synergistic antibiotic combinations. Class restriction of cephalosporins has been associated with a reduction in cephalosporins-cephamycin-carbapenem resistance among nosocomial Klebsiella isolates. This has been supplemented by restriction of carbapenem use after an initial 24-h period in an effort to reduce the selection of porin-deficient, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Evidence is reviewed suggesting that eradication of MDR-Ab nosocomial colonization may prevent subsequent infection. Relatively few standard antibacterial drugs remain active against MDR-Ab. Published clinical results of therapy with these agents are reviewed, and in vitro evidence of synergy between them is presented that suggests that combination therapy should be studied for enhanced clinical activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of azithromycin in combination with amikacin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin or imipenem against clinical isolates of Acinobacter baumannii.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the two-drug combinations of azithromycin with amikacin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin or imipenem against five clonally unrelated strains of Acinobacter baumannii were evaluated. Synergy studies were performed by the checkerboard microtiter method. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index was calculated for each drug combination. None of the four combinations tested was antagonistic. The combination of azithromycin and ceftazidime was synergistic (FIC index <or=0.5) for one strain and partially synergistic (FIC index 0.75) for another strain. An additive effect (FIC index = 1) was observed for the combinations of azithromycin with imipenem (two strains) or ceftazidime (one strain). The activities of the other combinations were indifferent (FIC index range from 1.5 to 2.5). It is concluded that azithromycin combined with ceftazidime has moderate synergistic activity against some multiresistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility among clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii from hospitalized patients in the United States, 1998 to 2001.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are the most prevalent nonfermentative bacterial species isolated from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. A surveillance study of 65 laboratories in the United States from 1998 to 2001 found >90% of isolates of P. aeruginosa from hospitalized patients to be susceptible to amikacin and piperacillin-tazobactam; 80 to 90% of isolates to be susceptible to cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and meropenem; and 70 to 80% of isolates to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate. From 1998 to 2001, decreases in antimicrobial susceptibility (percents) among non-intensive-care-unit (non-ICU) inpatients and ICU patients, respectively, were greatest for ciprofloxacin (6.1 and 6.5), levofloxacin (6.6 and 3.5), and ceftazidime (4.8 and 3.3). Combined 1998 to 2001 results for A. baumannii isolated from non-ICU inpatients and ICU patients, respectively, demonstrated that >90% of isolates tested were susceptible to imipenem (96.5 and 96.6%) and meropenem (91.6 and 91.7%); fewer isolates from both non-ICU inpatients and ICU patients were susceptible to amikacin and ticarcillin-clavulanate (70 to 80% susceptible); and <60% of isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, or levofloxacin. From 1998 to 2001, rates of multidrug resistance (resistance to at least three of the drugs ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and imipenem) showed small increases among P. aeruginosa strains isolated from non-ICU inpatients (5.5 to 7.0%) and ICU patients (7.4 to 9.1%). From 1998 to 2001, rates of multidrug resistance among A. baumannii strains isolated from non-ICU inpatients (27.6 to 32.5%) and ICU patients (11.6 to 24.2%) were higher and more variable than those observed for P. aeruginosa. Isolates concurrently susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to both imipenem and meropenem accounted for 89.8 and 91.2% of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates, respectively, studied from 1998 to 2001. In conclusion, for aminoglycosides and most beta-lactams susceptibility rates for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were constant or decreased only marginally (</=3%) from 1998 to 2001. Greater decreases in susceptibility rates were, however, observed for fluoroquinolones and ceftazidime among P. aeruginosa isolates.
TI  - Bronchoalveolar interleukin-1 beta: a marker of bacterial burden in mechanically  ventilated patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between concentrations of bronchoalveolar cytokines and bacterial burden (quantitative bacterial count) in intubated patients with a presumptive diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. DESIGN: A cross-sectional and clinical investigation. SETTING Medical/surgical and respiratory intensive care unit of a tertiary 1,200-bed medical center. PATIENTS: According to the time course of community-acquired pneumonia at the time of study with bronchoalveolar lavage, 69 mechanically ventilated patients were divided into three subgroups: primary (n = 11), referral (n = 23), and treated (n = 35) community-acquired pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the most abnormal area on chest radiograph by fiberoptic bronchoscope. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was processed for quantitative bacterial culture. The concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and interleukin-10) also were measured. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-two patients had a positive bacterial culture (bronchoalveolar lavage > or = 10 colony-forming units/mL)., and made up 76% of pathogens recovered at high concentrations. The concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-1 beta were 199.1 +/- 32.1 and 54.9 +/- 13.0 pg/mL (mean +/- se) in the patients with positive and negative bacterial culture, respectively (p < .001). Bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin- 1 beta was significantly higher in the patients with a high bacterial burden (p < .001), with mixed bacterial infection (p < .001), and with pneumonia (p < .001), compared with values in patients without these features. The relationship between bacterial load and concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-1 beta was very strong in the patients with primary and referral community-acquired pneumonia but was borderline in treated community-acquired pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The common pathogens were similar to the core pathogens of hospital-acquired pneumonia, probably due to antibiotic effects, delayed sampling, and superimposed nosocomial infection. Since the concentration of bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-1 beta was correlated with bacterial burden in the alveoli, it may be a marker for progressive and ongoing inflammation in patients who have not responded to pneumonia therapy and who have persistence of bacteria in the lung.
TI  - Comparison of methods of interpretation of checkerboard synergy testing.
AB  - Four different methods for interpreting the results of checkerboard synergy testing were compared by applying each to a set of synergy study data. Statistically significant differences in synergy were detected among methods (% synergy ranged from 10 to 83%). As interpretations were found to vary widely based upon method, one should be aware of this in interpreting the relevant literature.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis: high antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit in Karachi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity pattern so that guidelines can be prepared for empirical antibiotic therapy. SETTING: The study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at PNS Shifa (Naval Hospital), Karachi during January 1997 to June 1999. METHODS: Blood specimens for culture were drawn from 520 newborns admitted in a NICU with sepsis. The specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. Subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. The isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests. Antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was studied by Modified Kirby Baur disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: A total of 212 organisms were isolated. These included Staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 23), Escherichia coli (n = 22), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), Citrobacter diversus (n = 5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and group B Streptococcus (n = 2). On antibiotic sensitivity testing, 61.54% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. Susceptibility to the other common drugs was also quite low while 89.23% of these were susceptible to amikacin and 100% to vancomycin. More than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. Resistance to gentamicin was as high as 90.4% for Klebsiella pneumoniae; 60.87% for Acinetobacter baumannii. Resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone tested (ciprofloxacin) varied between 25-75%. Majority of the isolates were susceptible to meropenem and amikacin. CONCLUSION: In view of the isolation of highly antibiotic resistant organisms, vancomycin in combination with amikacin or a carbapenem is the drug of choice for empirically treating neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Clinical and bacteriological results from the administration of Cefepime (Maxipime) in patients with severe sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of Cefepime administered to critically ill sepsis patients, as well as possible adverse reactions and interactions. MATERIAL/METHODS: 30 patients with severe sepsis of different origin were treated with Cefepime a dosage of 2.0 g bid. Of these patients, 26 survived (86.67%). The clinical and bacteriological effects of antibiotic administration were recorded at the end of treatment. RESULTS: The treatment outcomes in terms of clinical results were as follows: 17 patients cured (56.67%), 7 improved (23.33%), 2 with unsatisfactory outcome (6.67%), and 4 failures (13.33%). Cefepime treatment resulted in a reduction of the APACHE II score from ca. 20 at the beginning to 9.44 at the end, while the SOFA score fell from 7 to 2.62. This indicates improved clinical status and reversal of multiple organ failure. The bacteriological results were as follows: pathogen eradication in 17 cases (56.67%), pathogen persistence in 8 cases (26.67%), and superinfection in 5 cases (16.66%). Out of 80 total hemocultures, 63 proved to be sterile. In two cases in vitro Enterococcus faecium was isolated with antibiotic resistance. Of 81 total cultures of infectious foci, 10 showed resistance: 4 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 Acinetobacter baumannii, and 2 Enterococcus faecalis. No side effects of Cefepime administration were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Cefepime administration resulted in low mortality, clinical improvement, minimal resistance, and lack of side effects. Cefepime is an effective drug of first choice for critically ill sepsis patients
TI  - [Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: VIRA Study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in Spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in October 2001 were studied. These included 294 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 96 Enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 Acinetobacter baumannii. Sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. Additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and MRSA strains was 24% in both cases. The pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. Telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. Most MRSA isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. All the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only 50% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as MRSA, CNS, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.
TI  - [Evaluation of the Rapid Lumi 'Eiken' using chemiluminescent assay for rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing].
AB  - One hundred ninety eight clinical isolates, including Enterobacteriaceae (70 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20 strains), Acinetobacter baumannii (10 strains), staphylococci (50 strains), enterococci (20 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (13 strains) were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities by using the Rapid Lumi 'Eiken' (RL). As a reference method, broth microdilution method according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used. Then, each MIC obtained by both of these methods was compared. In order to improve the discrepancy between MICs obtained by both methods, modification of the RL method was studied. All MICs using the RL method were obtained with an incubation period of 4 hours. The essential agreement (to within one twofold dilution) between MICs obtained by both methods was 82%. The false susceptible in the RL method test results (very major error) and the false resistant in the RL tests (major error) were 0.9% and 2.3%, respectively. The agreement of interpretive category (that is, when the categories obtained by both methods are in perfect agreement) was 89%. Proteus spp. and A. baumannii showed low essential agreements, 59% and 46% respectively. The differences were resulted from the RL method's MICs being higher than the reference method. In order to improve the difference between both methods, the RL method's procedure was modified in the inoculum size (10(6) CFU/mL to 10(5) CFU/mL), the menadione concentration (5 mg/L to 25 mg/L) and the interpretive criteria for Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. As the results of the modification, the essential agreement in Proteus spp. and A. baumannii increased to 82% and 81%, respectively, and there was no significant change in the other species of Enterobacteriaceae. In the case of the modified RL method to Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii, the essential agreement, the very major error, the major error and the agreement of interpretive category of all 198 strains were 87%, 1.4%, 1.5% and 90%, respectively. In conclusion, with only 4-hour incubation period, the RL method based on chemiluminescent assay gave reliable susceptibility testing among the most clinically important bacteria. Although several tests showed low essential agreement, it was possible to improve by use of the modified RL method. The Rapid Lumi 'Eiken' will provide useful information for choosing the most effective antibiotic for primary treatment to bacterial infections.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria by the Phoenix Automated Microbiology System.
AB  - The Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) was evaluated for its ability to identify nonfermenting gram-negative pathogens and measure their drug susceptibility. Isolates producing rare extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (PER-1, IMP-2, VIM-1, and VIM-2) were included in the study. Species identification was compared to that given by the ATB System (bio-Merieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), whereas susceptibility results were compared to those produced by a reference broth microdilution test (panels manufactured by Pasco Laboratories, Becton Dickinson). The Phoenix system consistently identified all isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 55) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 28), while in other cases species agreement was obtained for 47/53 isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, 29/31; Pseudomonas putida, 10/11; Burkholderia cepacia, 6/7; and Pseudomonas fluorescens, 2/4). Overall, the Phoenix and ATB systems gave equal results in 130/136 cases (95.6%). For two isolates, consistent identification was obtained at the genus level, thus bringing the cumulative agreement to 97.1%. MIC values (interpreted according to NCCLS guidelines) gave essential and categorical agreement in 94.2% and 93.1% of cases, respectively. Minor and major errors were 5.1% and 5.2%, respectively. No very major errors were produced. The mean time to results (TTR) for the Phoenix system was 14.8 +/- 1.6 h (mean +/- SD), with the shortest TTR being observedfor A. baumannii (13.0 +/- 1.8 h) and the longest one for P. aeruginosa (15.6 +/- 1.2 h). In conclusion, the Phoenix system performed rapidly and correctly in the identification of clinical isolates of important opportunistic pathogens and in measuring their susceptibility to antipseudomonal drugs.
TI  - Quantitative culture of endotracheal aspirates in the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients with treatment failure.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation of bacteriology between quantitative cultures of protected specimen brush (PSB), BAL, and quantitative endotracheal aspirate (QEA) in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients with treatment failure. DESIGN: Prospective observational clinical study. SETTING: A 15-bed medical ICU of tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: Forty-eight patients receiving mechanical ventilation with clinical suspected VAP who had been treated with antibiotics for at least 72 h without improvement. INTERVENTION: QEA, PSB, and BAL were performed with patients receiving antibiotics. The diagnostic thresholds for QEA, PSB, and BAL were 10(5), 10(3), and 10(4) cfu/mL, respectively. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Microbial culture findings were positive in 24 BAL samples (50%), in 23 PSB samples (48%), and in 28 QEA samples (58%). The correlations between of QEA vs PSB and QEA vs BAL were significant (rho = 0.567 and rho = 0.620, p < 0.01, respectively). The most commonly isolated microorganisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (27%), Staphylococcus aureus (24%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (15%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). Using the predetermined criteria, bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in 28 of 48 suspected VAP episodes based on PSB and/or BAL results. The diagnostic efficiency of QEA at threshold of 10(5) cfu/mL had a sensitivity of 92.8% and a specificity of 80%. CONCLUSIONS: QEA correlated with PSB and BAL in patients with suspected VAP who responded poorly to the existent antibiotic treatment. QEA missed only two cases of bacterial pneumonia diagnosed by invasive PSB and/or BAL with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. More importantly, QEA is noninvasive and easily repeatable. Early use of QEA is helpful to clinical physicians in decision making with regard to antibiotics use.
TI  - Association between intensity of chlorhexidine use and micro-organisms of reduced susceptibility in a hospital environment.
AB  - The potential for emergence of resistance to biocides has been a concern in recent years. This study tested whether an association exists between the intensity of chlorhexidine use and chlorhexidine susceptibility of micro-organisms isolated from patients in different clinical areas in an acute-care general hospital. Organisms frequently involved in nosocomial infections in the hospital were chosen for study over a six week period: Staphylococcus aureus (60 isolates), coagulase-negative staphylococci (48), Klebsiella pneumoniae (32), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60), Acinetobacter baumannii (16) and Candida albicans (35). An index of chlorhexidine exposure for each clinical unit was derived for the year preceding organism collection. Chlorhexidine susceptibility was evaluated using agar incorporation minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and disk diffusion. A statistically significant inverse correlation was shown between intensity of chlorhexidine use and the overall susceptibility of all study organisms taken together. There was no association when individual taxa were considered. These findings must be interpreted with caution considering that greater use of chlorhexidine is likely to occur in difficult clinical disciplines where antibiotic use, invasive procedures and other intensive care-related procedures, cross-infection and immunosuppression are all potential confounding factors. There was an excellent correlation between MICs and disk testing, suggesting that disk diffusion might be useful in studies involving more than one biocide.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of ertapenem against aerobic bacterial pathogens  isolated from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ertapenem, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, and piperacillin-tazobactam were compared against 1018 aerobic bacterial pathogens isolated from 531 patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection. Enterobacteriaceae accounted for 66.3% of the aerobic bacteria; Escherichia coli was the most common isolate. The ertapenem minimal inhibitory concentration was < or = 2 microg/mL for 74.6% of isolates and > or = 8 microg/mL for 21.9% (including isolates of enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Enterobacteriaceae, ertapenem was the most potent and the most active drug evaluated (100% susceptible), followed by ceftriaxone (98% susceptible), piperacillin-tazobactam (96% susceptible), amoxicillin-clavulanate (80% susceptible), and ampicillin-sulbactam (64% susceptible). Piperacillin-tazobactam was the only drug evaluated with clinically useful activity against P. aeruginosa. In summary, ertapenem was highly active in vitro against many clinically important aerobic intra-abdominal bacterial pathogens, especially Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Citywide clonal outbreak of multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Brooklyn, NY: the preantibiotic era has returned.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenems are important agents for treating nosocomial gram-negative infections. Carbapenem-resistant bacteria have become increasingly problematic in certain regions. This study determined the citywide prevalence and molecular epidemiological features of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Brooklyn, NY. METHODS: All unique patient isolates of A baumannii and P aeruginosa were collected from 15 Brooklyn hospitals from July 1, 1999, through September 30, 1999. Antibiotic susceptibilities, the genetic relatedness of resistant isolates, and the relationship between antibiotic use and resistance rates were determined. RESULTS: A total of 419 isolates of A baumannii and 823 isolates of P aeruginosa were collected. For A baumannii, 53% were resistant to meropenem and/or imipenem, and 12% were resistant to all standard antibiotics. Ribotyping revealed that a single clone accounted for 62% of the samples and was isolated from patients at all 15 hospitals. The rate of carbapenem resistance was associated with cephalosporin use at each hospital (P =.004). For P aeruginosa, 24% were resistant to imipenem, 5% to amikacin, and 15% to 29% to other antipseudomonal agents. Ribotyping revealed that 3 clones accounted for nearly half of the isolates and were shared by most hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 400 patients were infected or colonized with carbapenem-resistant A baumannii and P aeruginosa during a 3-month period in 1999. A few strains have spread widely throughout hospitals in this region. The prevalence of resistant A baumannii seems to be correlated with cephalosporin use. Multiresistant hospital-acquired bacteria should be viewed as a serious public health issue rather than an individual hospital's problem. An intensive coordinated effort will be needed to effectively address this problem.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  - The antibiotic and chlorhexidine (CHX) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus (not MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (MBC) and/or minimal inhibitory (MIC) concentrations. Non-fermentative bacteria tolerated CHX at high concentrations; Gram-positive cocci, especially S. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. We found a good correlation between CHX and antibiotic susceptibility in both MIC and MBC among Gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in MBC among Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate increased CHX resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. This finding gives clinicians the ability to predict CHX susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.
TI  - [Interpretative reading of the non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli antibiogram].
AB  - Among non-fermenting Gram-negative rods, the most clinically important species are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which are frequently multiresistant. P. aeruginosa resistance to beta-lactams depends on the production of chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, altered permeability (loss of OprD porin is related to carbapenem-resistance) and active efflux pumps, particularly MexAB-OprM. In aminoglycoside-resistant strains the main mechanism of resistance is the production of inactivating enzymes; the efflux pump MexXY-OprM is also involved. Quinolone-resistance in P. aeruginosa is related to changes in topoisomerases, altered permeability and efflux pumps. The mechanisms of resistance of A. baumannii have not been well characterized, which makes interpretative reading of the antibiogram in this organism difficult. Resistance to beta-lactams is associated with the production of beta-lactamases and altered penicillin-binding proteins. Resistance to aminoglycosides has been related to modifying enzymes and resistance to quinolones to altered targets. S. maltophilia is resistant to carbapenems and other beta-lactams because of the production of two beta-lactamases (L-1 and L-2). Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes have also been described in this species. In contrast to what is observed in other organisms, S. maltophilia resistance to quinolones has been mainly related to active efflux, rather than to target alterations.
TI  - Emerging carbapenemases in Gram-negative aerobes.
AB  - Carbapenemases may be defined as beta-lactamases that significantly hydrolyze at  least imipenem or/and meropenem. Carbapenemases involved in acquired resistance are of Ambler molecular classes A, B, and D. Class A, clavulanic acid-inhibited carbapenemases are rare. They are either chromosomally encoded (NMC-A, Sme-1 to Sme-3, IMI-1) in Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, or plasmid encoded, such as KPC-1 in Klebsiella pneumoniae and GES-2 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the latter being a point-mutant of the clavulanic acid-inhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase GES-1. The class B enzymes are the most clinically significant carbapenemases. They are metalloenzymes of the IMP or VIM series. They have been reported worldwide but mostly from South East Asia and Europe. Metalloenzymes, whose genes are plasmid and integron located, hydrolyze virtually all beta-lactams except aztreonam. Finally, the class D carbapenemases are increasingly reported in Acinetobacter baumannii but compromise imipenem and meropenem susceptibility only marginally. The sources of the acquired carbapenemase genes remain unknown, as does the relative importance of the spread of epidemic strains as opposed to the spread of plasmid- or integron-borne genes. Because most of these carbapenemases confer only reduced susceptibility to carbapenems in Enterobacteriaceae, they may remain underestimated as a consequence of the lack of their detection.
TI  - Hospital-acquired infections following the 1999 Marmara earthquake.
AB  - In this study, medical records of all casualties admitted to our hospital following the Marmara earthquake, which struck northwest Turkey and resulted in the destruction of several towns in the Marmara region, were evaluated retrospectively. The time buried under the rubble, demographic data, type of medical and surgical therapies performed, type of injury and data on infection were analysed. Between 17 August and 25 September 1999, 630 trauma victims were received at our hospital and 532 (84%) of them were hospitalized. The mean age of hospitalized patients (312 males, 220 females) was 32 years (2-90 years). Two hundred and twenty patients were hospitalized for more than 48 h. Forty-one of them (18.6%) had 43 hospital-acquired infection (HAI) episodes, which were mostly wound infections (46.5%). A total of 143 culture specimens was collected and 48 yielded the following potential pathogens: 15 Acinetobacter baumanii (31.2%), nine Staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), seven Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.6%), six Escherichia coli (12.5%), six Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), two Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.2%) and three various Pseudomonas spp. (6.3%). All S. aureus strains were found to be resistant to methicillin in vitro. Two strains of A. baumannii and one P. aeruginosa were found to be resistant to all antimicrobials including carbapenems. Fifty-three victims died (10%) and 36 of those died during the first 48 h because of severe injuries and multi-organ failure. After 48 h of hospitalization, the mortality rate was significantly higher in those patients with HAI (14/41) than those without (3/179) (34.1% vs. 1.7%, P<0.05). In conclusion, trauma is the significant factor associated with HAI and a high incidence of Acinetobacter strains was responsible for HAI in trauma patients.
TI  - Molecular characterization of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter genomospecies 3 from Korea: identification of two new integrons carrying the bla(VIM-2) gene cassettes.
AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. used to be rare, but are increasingly isolated in Korea. Among 28 isolates of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. found in a Korean hospital in 1998 and 1999, 14 produced metallo-beta-lactamases. The bla(VIM-2) gene was detected, by PCR, in 11 and two isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter genomospecies 3, respectively, and bla(IMP-1) in one isolate of A. baumannii. The MICs of imipenem for the isolates were 8-32 mg/L. PFGE analysis of SmaI-digested genomic DNA gave identical patterns in eight of 11 bla(VIM-2)-positive A. baumannii isolates from respiratory specimens of ICU patients. The bla(VIM-2) gene cassettes in the isolates are identical to those from Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in Europe, but are inserted into new class I integrons In105 and In106. The attC site of the last cassette of the array in In106 is interrupted by the insertion of a putative class II intron. This is the first report of VIM-2 beta-lactamase-producing A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomospecies 3. Production of the VIM-2 enzyme presents an emerging threat of carbapenem resistance among Acinetobacter spp. in Korea.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - [Monitoring the incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in microbiology laboratories using Bacterio software].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since 1997, the microbiology laboratory of the hospital center in Lens has monitored hospital ecology and epidemiology to provide rapid information that help to adapt probabilistic antibiotherapy and to estimate the impact of hygienic preventive measures on the incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRB). METHODS: Monitoring with statistical software (Epi-Info) could be pursued and improved on with Bacterio, a specific software for microbiology laboratories. We studied the incidence of MRB not only in clinical specimens but also in ecologic specimens to detect BMR colonization. RESULTS: In the year 2000, the incidence reached 4.11 for 1000 hospitalization days and 3.34 for 100 admissions. This clearly differed from clinical activity. From 1998 to 2000 the incidence of BMR remained stable. BMR was detected within 48 hours after admission in 22.9% of cases. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ticarcillin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common BMR in our hospital. Extended broad spectrum beta-lactamase enterobacterii and Acinetobacter baumannii represented respectively 23% and 13% of the MRB. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia represented a minority and no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found. CONCLUSION: Bacterio is a software well adapted to the use of microbiological data banks. Continuous monitoring of the incidence of BMR is very useful in the clinical care and hospital hygiene units.
TI  - Recent developments in carbapenems.
AB  - Carbapenems are beta-lactam antibiotics characterised by the presence of a beta-lactam ring with a carbon instead of sulfone in the 4-position of the thyazolidinic moiety. The first carbapenem to be utilised in therapy was imipenem, the N-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin. Imipenem is coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of human renal dehydropeptidase I, as imipenem is hydrolysed by this enzyme. Meropenem was the first carbapenem with a 1-beta-methyl group and 2-thio pyrrolidinyl moiety, which renders this antibiotic stable to renal dehydropeptidase I. Other carbapenems for parenteral administration later discovered include biapenem, panipenem, ertapenem, lenapenem, E-1010, S-4661 and BMS-181139. Carbapenems which are orally administered include sanfetrinem, DZ-2640, CS-834 and GV-129606. Carbapenems have an ultra-broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and stability to almost all clinically relevant beta-lactamases. This differentiates them from all other currently available classes of beta-lactam antibiotics. However, Class B beta-lactamases, along with some rare Class A and D enzymes, are able to hydrolyse these antibiotics. Although Class B enzymes are generally chromosomally-encoded (isolated from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aeromonas spp., Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Flavobacterium spp. and Legionella gormanii), plasmid-metallo-beta-lactamases now are appearing in B. fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and members of Enterobacteriaceae such as Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The number of these enzymes compared to the number of other beta-lactamase types is still low, however, it is likely that they will spread due to the increased selective pressure of carbapenem use. The very broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity associated with a good clinical efficacy and a favourable safety profile makes the carbapenems valuable as 'first-line' antibiotics in initial empirical therapy for the treatment of severe infections.
TI  - How many nosocomial infections are associated with cross-transmission? A prospective cohort study in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the percentage of cross-transmissions in an intensive care unit (ICU) with high nosocomial infection (NI) rates according to the data of the German Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System. SETTING: A 14-bed surgical ICU of a 1,300-bed, tertiary-care teaching hospital. METHOD: Prospective surveillance of NIs during a period of 9 months. If an NI was present, the isolates of the following indicator pathogens were stored and typed by species: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacter species. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed for typing of S. aureus strains and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction was applied for the other pathogens. The presence of two indistinguishable strains in two patients was considered as one episode of cross-transmission. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-two patients were observed during a period of 2,444 patient-days; 96 NIs were identified in 59 patients and the overall incidence density of NI was 39.3 per 1,000 patient-days. For 104 isolates, it was possible to consider typing results. Altogether, 36 cross-transmissions have lead to NIs in other patients. That means at least 37.5% of all NIs identified were due to cross-transmissions. CONCLUSION: Because of the method of this study, the percentage of NIs due to cross-transmission identified for this ICU is an "at least number." In reality, the number of cross-transmissions, and thus the number of avoidable infections, may have been even higher. However, it is difficult to assess whether the percentage of NIs due to cross-transmission determined for this ICU may be the crucial explanation for the relatively high infection rate in comparison to other surgical ICUs.
TI  - Current status of antimicrobial resistance in Taiwan.
AB  - While some trends in antimicrobial resistance rates are universal, others appear  to be unique for specific regions. In Taiwan, the strikingly high prevalence of resistance to macrolides and streptogramin in clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria correlates with the widespread use of these agents in the medical and farming communities, respectively. The relatively low rate of enterococci that are resistant to glycopeptide does not parallel the high use of glycopeptides and extended-spectrum beta-lactams in hospitals. The evolving problem of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates is substantial, and some unique enzymes have been found. Recently, some gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii) that are resistant to all available antimicrobial agents including carbapenems have emerged.
TI  - The cost of antibiotic resistance: effect of resistance among Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudmonas aeruginosa on length of hospital stay.
AB  - To assess the effect of antimicrobial resistance on length of hospital stay, a case-control study compared infections due to four nosocomial pathogens. Significantly increased lengths of stay were associated with infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infections with resistant pathogens are associated with prolonged hospitalization.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative isolates from European intensive care units: data from the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) programme.
AB  - Susceptibility data were collected for 6243 gram-negative isolates from 29 European ICUs participating in the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Programme (1997-2000). The most commonly isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%), Escherichia coli (19.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.4%), and Enterobacter cloacae (7.7%). The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producers was higher in Turkish, Russian and Italian ICUs (27.9-39.6%) than in other countries (2.5-10.8%). The frequency of AmpC-cephalosporin hyper-producers was 16.8-55.4%. Meropenem was more active against Proteus mirabilis than imipenem (99.0% versus 88.8% susceptibility, respectively). Against Acinetobacter baumannii, meropenem (79.6% susceptible) and imipenem (82.2%) were more active than comparators (34.3-51.6%). Meropenem and imipenem exhibited good activity against P. aeruginosa (76.1% and 68.2%, respectively; but with inter-country variation). Ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli and K. pneumoniae increased and needs close monitoring. Meropenem (98.2-99.8% susceptibility) and imipenem (88.8-99.4%) remained potent against important species of gram-negative bacteria from European ICUs actively using meropenem.
TI  - [Effectiveness of contact isolation in the control of multiresistant bacteria in  an intensive care service].
AB  - AIM: To describe the frequency, characteristics and progression of critically ill patients admitted to the ICU, for whom isolation is indicated due to detection of multiresistant pathogenic bacteria, and to study the effectiveness of precautionary measures to avoid dissemination of these microorganisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, observational, cohort study performed by a specially created working group of four nurses and an ICU specialist. The study included 55 patients in whom contact isolation was indicated (isolation rate, 15.2 per 100 patients), collected over a 16-month period. RESULTS: The multiresistant bacteria responsible for isolation of the patients were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (17 cases), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (15 cases), Acinetobacter baumannii (4 cases) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- producing Enterobacteria (2 cases). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. was not identified in any case. The mean duration of ICU isolation was 17.6 6 5.1 days (range 1-75). Multiresistant bacteria were classified as intra-ICU nosocomial in 39 cases (70.9%), extra-ICU nosocomial in 10 cases (18.2%) and community-acquired in 6 (10.9%). During the study period, no epidemic outbreak due to any of the controlled bacteria was detected. The multiresistant bacteria presented in the form of colonization in 41 cases (74.5%). The reasons for discontinuing isolation were death of the patient in 18 cases, transferal to a hospital ward (discharge from the ICU) in 19 cases, and eradication of the bacteria in 18 cases. Of the 55 patients with multiresistant bacteria, 35 (63.6%) died during hospitalization, and 23 of these (41.8%) during their stay in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a working team for early detection of multiresistant pathogenic bacteria resulted in application of contact isolation in 15.2% of patients admitted. Surveillance to fulfill isolation precautions in a medical-surgical ICU achieved an absence of epidemic outbreaks due to these bacteria during the study period.
TI  - Antibiotic policy: a tool for controlling resistance of hospital pathogens.
AB  - Multiresistant Gram-negative bacilli, including strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, resistant to broad spectrum beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, are recovered at increasing frequency from patients suffering from nosocomial infections, particularly from those receiving intensive care. The emergence and spread of resistant pathogens to endemic and epidemic levels has frequently been related in time and place to the intensive use of antibiotics to which these microorganisms have developed resistance, notably third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Recent investigations have indicated that the prevalence of resistance can be reduced by scheduled changes of empiric treatment regimens, involving discontinuation of intensively prescribed drugs and substitution with newly introduced antibiotics of another class to which the prevalent resistant strains remain susceptible. Among these drugs, penicillins---beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, 'fourth generation' cephalosporins and, where little used previously, fluoroquinolones, have been introduced successfully in high risk units where ceftazidime-resistant strains of K.pneumoniae, Enterobacter and Citrobacter spp or glycopeptide-resistant enterococci had become highly prevalent. However, these studies do not demonstrate a direct causal relationship between changes in prescribing practices and ecological improvements, because their observational design cannot be controlled. In most studies, several important factors influencing the dynamics of resistance were not monitored and the relative contribution of decreased emergence versus control of cross-transmission to the improved susceptibility rates is not clear. We propose that additional long-term studies are required to better track the ecological impact and to determine the optimal modalities of programmed changes of antibiotic prescribing as an antibiotic resistance prevention or control strategy.
TI  - Infections in patients requiring ventilation in intensive care: application of a  new classification.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To classify infections according to the carrier state determined by surveillance cultures of throat and rectum, rather than by the traditional criterion of the time of onset after admission. METHODS: An observational cohort study of 3 months' duration was performed in a mixed medical---surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in a district general hospital of a subset of patients requiring mechanical ventilation for 3 days. Surveillance cultures from throat and rectum were obtained on admission to the ICU and then twice weekly to distinguish carriage of potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPM) brought in by the patient from microorganisms acquired during the ICU stay. RESULTS: Out of the total population of 104 patients, 21 patients were enrolled over 3 months. Eight patients (38%) developed 12 infections, half of which were of primary endogenous pathogenesis and caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa carried by the patients on admission. The remaining six were of secondary endogenous pathogenesis and caused by Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa acquired in the unit. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional classifications of hospital infection are challenged. If the traditional 48-h cut-off point was used, then 9 of 12 cases (75%) of infection would have been classified as nosocomial, whereas using the method based on the carrier state, 50% of all infections were caused by microorganisms carried by the patient on admission to the ICU. Moreover, we believe that the distinction between primary endogenous, secondary endogenous and exogenous is valid because these three types of infection each require different control methods.
TI  - Evaluation of the ID 32E for the identification of Gram-negative glucose-fermenting and glucose-non-fermenting bacilli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ID 32E bacterial identification system for accuracy in the identification of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii/Iwoffii. METHODS: Stock cultures of 497 Enterobacteriaceae and 27 commonly encountered non-enteric Gram-negative rods were tested in the ID 32E system. For each isolate, the resulting 11-digit profile number was converted to an identification using the APILAB Plus software (version 3.2.2). This identification was then compared to the reference identification obtained using conventional biochemicals. RESULTS: Of the 524 isolates tested, 405 (77.3%) were identified correctly; 52 (9.9%) were identified incorrectly. Sixty-seven (12.8%) identifications were either doubtful or unacceptable, and were not limited to any particular genus or species, with the exception of Ewingella americana and Serratia plymuthica, which did not grow well enough in the strip at 35 degrees C to be correctly identified. All five isolates of Acinetobacter Iwoffii were misidentified as Alcaligenes spp. CONCLUSIONS: With this challenge set of organisms, the ID 32E correctly identified 77.3% of the isolates tested. For commonly encountered isolates, the accuracy approached 90%. We conclude that the ID 32E offers an alternative for the identification of common clinical isolates.
TI  - Multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in Taiwan.
AB  - A susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from March, 2000, to June, 2000, in Taiwan. This study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for S. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), Enterobacter cloacae (57%), Serratia marcescens (34%), and Citrobacter freundii (60%). High rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for P. aeruginosa (15%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. The percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for S. pneumoniae (42%), Enterococcus faecium (71%), and ORSA (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. The resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of ICUs. Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in ICU settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in ICU patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among commonly isolated Gram-negative bacilli  in 2000: TRUST and TSN data for the United States. Tracking Resistance in the United States Today. The Surveillance Network.
AB  - From January to May 2000, as part of the Tracking Resistance in the United States Today (TRUST) surveillance initiative, clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=2519) and non-fermentative Gram-negatives (n=580) were prospectively collected from 26 hospital laboratories across the United States. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin) and seven other agents. In addition, data for the same period were collected from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA, an electronic surveillance network that receives data from more than 200 laboratories in the US. Both surveillance methods produced similar results. Against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, imipenem was the most active agent, followed by the fluoroquinolones; > or = 86.7% of isolates of all species of Enterobacteriaceae except Providencia spp. were susceptible to fluoroquinolones by TRUST and TSN surveillance. TRUST identified differences in susceptibility to the three fluoroquinolones of > or = 2% for Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens. Isolates of P. mirabilis were considerably more susceptible to levofloxacin (94.0%) than to ciprofloxacin (87.7%) and gatifloxacin (87.7%). Other results from TRUST included Pseudomonas aeruginosa being slightly more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (73.5%) and levofloxacin (73.0%) than gatifloxacin (71.0%). Imipenem was the only compound with significant activity (95.1% susceptible, TRUST; 87.4% susceptible, TSN) against Acinetobacter baumannii, but it was inactive against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. S. maltophilia isolates were more susceptible to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin (77.7-79.8%) than ciprofloxacin (29.7-33.0%). Against 513 urinary isolates of Escherichia coli in TRUST, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equipotent. Age and gender had no clear effect on the activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or gatifloxacin. Similar results for all three fluoroquinolones were seen in outpatients and inpatients. TRUST and TSN data indicated that resistance rates had not changed appreciably for any compound studied since a similar study conducted in 1999. TRUST centralized in vitro and electronic (TSN) surveillance methods provided an effective strategy for monitoring trends in resistance.
TI  - Present situation of antimicrobial resistance in Korea.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. In Korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, class C beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in Korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. Recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa present new threats in Korea.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. A total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. The MIC of cefpiramide for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). Fifty-one percent (26/51) of Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against E. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. Cefpiramide was more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. Cefpiramide-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant S. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against Acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. Ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. Cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 2 microg/ml). Against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an MIC90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. These results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against Enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylo-coccus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.
TI  - Microbial killing activity of peracetic acid.
AB  - In vitro killing activity of peracetic acid (Perasafe) at a concentration of 0.26 per cent w/v was tested against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Acinetobacter baumannii, Sternotrophomonas maltophilia, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus subtilis spore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immuno-deficiency virus type I. Exposure to Peracetic acid (0.26% w/v) for 10 minutes resulted in massive killing of all the aforementioned organisms and spore.
TI  - Nosocomial antibiotic resistance in multiple gram-negative species: experience at one hospital with squeezing the resistance balloon at multiple sites.
AB  - Increased use of antibiotics has led to the isolation of multidrug-resistant bacteria, especially in intensive care units and long-term care facilities. Resistance in specific gram-negative bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is of great concern, because a growing number of reports have documented mechanisms whereby these microorganisms have become resistant to all available antibacterial agents used in therapy. Reduction in the selection of these multidrug-resistant bacteria can be accomplished by a combination of several strategies. These include having an understanding of the genetics of both innate and acquired characteristics of bacteria; knowing resistance potentials for specific antibacterials; monitoring resistance trends in bacteria designated as problematic organisms within a particular institution on a routine basis; modifying antibiotic formularies when and where needed; creating institutional education programs; and enforcing strict infection-control practices. Strategies appropriate for primary prevention of nosocomial resistance may differ from those required for control of existing epidemic or endemic resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities among clinical isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in a Taiwanese University Hospital.
AB  - Infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria with resistance to extended-spectrum  cephalosporins require the identification of effective alternative antimicrobial therapy. To determine the role of other pre-existing or currently available antimicrobial agents in treating infections caused by these multidrug-resistant pathogens, we evaluated the in vitro susceptibilities of these agents in 411 non-duplicate isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria recovered between January 1999 and December 1999 in a major teaching hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. These isolates included cefotaxime-resistant (MICs > or = 2 mg/L) Escherichia coli (66 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (77 isolates); cefotaxime-resistant (MICs > or = 64 mg/L) Enterobacter cloacae (59 isolates), Serratia marcescens (52 isolates) and Citrobacter freundii (52 isolates); and ceftazidime-resistant (MICs > or = 64 mg/L) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50 isolates) and Acinetobacter baumannii (55 isolates). Overall, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) had good activity against the cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae tested (>90% of isolates were susceptible). However, carbapenems had limited activity against the ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa (only 4% of isolates were susceptible) and A. baumannii (51-56% of isolates were susceptible). Among the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates tested, 33.3% and 58.4%, respectively, exhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype, determined by the double disc method. Over 80% of cefotaxime-resistant E. cloacae and C. freundii were susceptible to cefepime, but this agent had limited activity against other bacteria tested. Susceptibilities of these isolates to ciprofloxacin varied, ranging from 25% for A. baumannii to 92% for E. cloacae. Newer fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin) had equal or less activity against these organisms, except for A. baumannii for which their MIC(90)s (8-16 mg/L) were four- to 16-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin (MIC(90) 128 mg/L).
TI  - Comparison of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and amplified fragment-length polymorphism for epidemiological investigations of common nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare molecular typing by amplified fragment-length polymorphism  (AFLP) analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with respect to the ability to differentiate between epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates of common nosocomial pathogens recovered during a period of endemicity. DESIGN: Retrospective laboratory analysis. SETTING: Tertiary-care institution. METHODS: 17 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, 22 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 22 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcusfaecium (VRE) were typed by both methods. RESULTS: AFLP generated comparable results to PFGE for A baumannii and P aeruginosa isolates; both methods identified epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates. However, strain typing of VRE isolates produced discordant results between the two methods. PFGE identified 10 different strain types and differentiated between all epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates. In contrast, AFLP generated only five different strain types, three of which contained both epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates. CONCLUSION: Molecular typing by AFLP is comparable to PFGE for A baumannii and P aeruginosa isolates. For VRE isolates, however, PFGE remains the method of choice.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for the identification and susceptibility testing of three species of nonfermenting gram-negative rods frequently isolated from clinical samples.
AB  - VITEK 2 is a new automatic system for the identification and susceptibility testing of the most clinically important bacteria. In the present study 198 clinical isolates, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 146), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 25), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 27) were evaluated. Reference susceptibility testing of cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin, tobramycin, levofloxacin (only for P. aeruginosa), co-trimoxazole (only for S. maltophilia), and ampicillin-sulbactam and tetracycline (only for A. baumannii) was performed by microdilution (NCCLS guidelines). The VITEK 2 system correctly identified 91.6, 100, and 76% of P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia, and A. baumannii isolates, respectively, within 3 h. The respective percentages of essential agreement (to within 1 twofold dilution) for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were 89.0 and 88.0% (cefepime), 91.1 and 100% (cefotaxime), 95.2 and 96.0% (ceftazidime), 98.6 and 100% (ciprofloxacin), 88.4 and 100% (gentamicin), 87.0 and 92.0% (imipenem), 85.0 and 88.0% (meropenem), 84.2 and 96.0% (piperacillin), and 97.3 and 80% (tobramycin). The essential agreement for levofloxacin against P. aeruginosa was 86.3%. The percentages of essential agreement for ampicillin-sulbactam and tetracycline against A. baumannii were 88.0 and 100%, respectively. Very major errors for P. aeruginosa (resistant by the reference method, susceptible with the VITEK 2 system [resistant to susceptible]) were noted for cefepime (0.7%), cefotaxime (0.7%), gentamicin (0.7%), imipenem (1.4%), levofloxacin (2.7%), and piperacillin (2.7%) and, for one strain of A. baumannii, for imipenem. Major errors (susceptible to resistant) were noted only for P. aeruginosa and cefepime (2.0%), ceftazidime (0.7%), and piperacillin (3.4%). Minor errors ranged from 0.0% for piperacillin to 22.6% for cefotaxime against P. aeruginosa and from 0.0% for piperacillin and ciprofloxacin to 20.0% for cefepime against A. baumannii. The VITEK 2 system provided co-trimoxazole MICs only for S. maltophilia; no very major or major errors were obtained for co-trimoxazole against this species. It is concluded that the VITEK 2 system allows the rapid identification of S. maltophilia and most P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates. The VITEK 2 system can perform reliable susceptibility testing of many of the antimicrobial agents used against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. It would be desirable if new versions of the VITEK 2 software were able to determine MICs and the corresponding clinical categories of agents active against S. maltophilia.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of argon fluoride (ArF) excimer laser on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of argon fluoride (ArF) excimer laser radiation on clinically important strains of gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity of ArF excimer laser radiation was evaluated on two Acinetobacter baumannii, one Enterobacter cloacae, three Escherichia coli, two Helicobacter pylori, one Klebsiella pneumoniae and two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens and typed by the usual biochemical procedures. Square agar plates of 12 x 12 cm were divided into rectangular (2 x 3 cm) regions and spread with 0.5x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU)/ml of bacterial suspension. The excess liquid was removed and the plates were allowed to dry for 30 min. A total of 96 rectangular (2x3 cm) regions were used for each strain, in order to test an equal number of laser parameters. Each rectangular region was irradiated with different laser parameters, using a 193 nm ArF excimer laser, linked with a simple Galilean afocal system and a rectangular diaphragm of the same dimensions as the original laser beam cross-section, at a distance of 10 cm from the irradiated surface. This system was used in order to keep the laser pulse energy under 80 mJ and to cut-out the non-transverse electromagnetic mode branches of the laser beam. We then studied the bacterial survival ratio versus the number of laser pulses, the repetition frequency and the total laser beam fluence. Our results showed that the total laser beam fluence was the most important parameter to consider in evaluating the bactericidal effect of ArF excimer laser radiation. A critical value of the total fluence was determined for each strain, such that, for laser beam fluences greater than this critical value, no colonies appeared to survive while, for laser fluences less than this critical value, the survival ratio did not exceed 2 x 10(7) CFU (2 x 10(-5)%). These critical values were found to vary between 8 J/cm2 and 16 J/cm2 for the bacterial species studied. Under these conditions, ArF laser irradiation is promising for the sterilisation of hard surfaces and for in situ application.
TI  - Efficacy of cefepime versus ceftazidime in the treatment of adult pneumonia.
AB  - Effective empiric treatment of pneumonia requires antibiotic coverage against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant isolates. This study evaluated the efficacy of cefepime treatment in 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 21 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ceftazidime treatment in 20 patients with HAP. The mean age of patients was over 70 years. More than half of the patients had multiple lobe involvement. There was no significant difference in the severity of illness according to the acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III score between the HAP-cefepime and HAP-ceftazidime group. The most common bacteria isolated from sputum of patients with CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2). In patients with HAP, P. aeruginosa (n = 13), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 11), Serratia marcescens (n = 6), K. pneumoniae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 3), Citrobacter spp. (n = 2), and Escherichia coli (n = 2) were isolated. The cure rates were 95%, 76%, and 60% in the CAP-cefepime group, the HAP-cefepime group, and the HAP-ceftazidime group, respectively. The increased rates of antimicrobial resistance commonly found among isolates causing CAP and HAP indicate that extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents, such as cefepime, would be more appropriate therapeutic agents.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance among Gram-negative non-fermentative bacteria at a teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - The incidence and antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative non-fermentative bacteria isolated over 1 year at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia were investigated. A total of 499 of these microorganisms were collected and account for 16% of all Gram-negative bacteria isolated. The most common species were Pseudomonas aeruginosa 291 (56%), Acinetobacter baumannii 170 (34%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 35 (7%). 168 (34%) of these microorganisms were isolated from Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 147 (30%) from General Medicine, and 24 (25%) from Surgery wards. ICU was the main site of isolation of P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia, while A. baumannii was more frequently isolated from medicine and surgery units. The vast majority of the isolates were resistant to many antibiotics tested. The antimicrobial resistance patterns of P. aeruginosa showed lowest resistance to imipenem (13%), amikacin (17%), and ciprofloxacin (18%). Imipenem was also the most active antimicrobial agent against A. baumannii (15%) resistance. S. maltophilia exhibited multi-drug resistance, and was susceptible only to sulfonamide (6%).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance surveillance of bacteria in 1999 in Korea with a special reference to resistance of enterococci to vancomycin and gram-negative bacilli to third generation cephalosporin, imipenem, and fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The trend of antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from patients in 30 Korean hospitals in 1999 was analyzed with a particular attention to cefotaxime- or fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative bacilli, imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Adequacy of susceptibility testing, and any change in the frequencies of isolated species were also analyzed. The results showed that only 20% and 30% of hospitals tested the piperacillin-tazobactam and cefoxitin susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae, respectively, only 24% of hospitals the piperacillin-tazobactam susceptibility of P. aeruginosa, and 17% of hospitals the fusidic acid susceptibility of staphylococci. Among the isolates 26.3% were glucose-nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, and 34.7% of Enterococcus were Enterococcus faecium. Slight decline of cefotaxime-resistance rate to 20% was noted in Klebsiella pneumoniae, while fluoroquinolone-resistance rate was 68% in Acinetobacter baumannii. The ceftazidime- and imipenem-resistance rates were 17% and 18%, respectively in P. aeruginosa. The vancomycin-resistance rate of E. faecium rose significantly to 15.1%, but the rates varied significantly depending on hospitals suggesting presence of different degree of selective pressure or nosocomial spread. In conclusion, the prevalence of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and the increase of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium were the particularly worrisome phenomena observed in this study.
TI  - [Activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against major hospital bacterial pathogens].
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate susceptibility of 976 bacterial isolates from nosocomial infections to cefepime and 9 other antibiotics used in the treatment of hospitalised patients. Bacterial strains were mainly derived from wound and soft tissue infections, sputum, abscesses and blood. The most prevalent etiologic agents were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), Escherichia coli (13.8%), Staphyloccocus aureus (9.7%, Acinetobacter baumannii (9.12%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.38%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%). The most susceptible to cefepime were strains of K. pneumoniae (98.62%), E. coli (98.52%) and E. cloacae (98.19%) including those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. The degree of susceptibility to cefepime was equal to that of imipenem. A. baumannii was the least susceptible species (67.42%). This study indicate that cefepime may play an important role in therapy of nosocomial infections in particular caused by Enterobacteriace.
TI  - Microbiologic aspects of predominant bacteria isolated from the burn patients in  Korea.
AB  - The risk of infection in burns is well-known. In recent decades, the antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients has increased. For this reason, we have carried out a study of the predominant bacterial profiles and antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates from a burn center in Korea. A retrospective study was undertaken at Hallym University, Hangang Sacred Heart Hospital to examine the bacterial isolates from the burn patients and to compare the antibiograms of the predominant bacteria isolated from these patients with those of the other wards over a period of 3 years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common (n=2997, 45.7%) isolate from the burn patients followed by Staphylococcus aureus (n=21261, 19.2%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n=878, 13.4%). These bacteria, isolated from the burn patients, were almost all higher in antimicrobial resistance rate than those in the non-burn patients (P<0.05). Because these bacteria showed very high resistant rates, they must be avoided in order to control a hospital-acquired infection. Our results seem helpful in providing useful guidelines for choosing effective empiric antimicrobial therapy against bacteria isolated from the burn patients in Korea.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia: importance of recognition of aetiological agents to define  an appropriate initial empirical therapy.
AB  - Of the 16,024 patients hospitalized from January 1995 to October 1997, 397 (2.4%) acquired nosocomial pneumonia and the aetiological agent was defined in 101 (25%). About 82% developed late onset pneumonia (>7 days of hospitalization). The site of isolation of microorganisms was bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (49%), blood culture (39%), pleural effusion (10%) and (2%) pulmonary tissue. Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 54% of infections. Staphylococcus aureus (34%) was the most frequent microorganism isolated followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (29%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, responsible for 7% of nosocomial pneumonia. Monotherapy gave good cover for early onset pneumonia, but not for late onset pneumonia. Based on our selection criteria, ciprofloxacin was the best monotherapy for early (50%) and late (31%) onset pneumonia. Vancomycin plus ciprofloxacin gave cover of 85% of early and 64% of late onset pneumonia. Monotherapy with ciprofloxacin and also combination therapy of ciprofloxacin plus vancomycin may be good options as initial empirical therapy for nosocomial pneumonia.
TI  - Evaluation of current activities of fluoroquinolones against gram-negative bacilli using centralized in vitro testing and electronic surveillance.
AB  - Given the propensity for Enterobacteriaceae and clinically significant nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli to acquire antimicrobial resistance, consistent surveillance of the activities of agents commonly prescribed to treat infections arising from these organisms is imperative. This study determined the activities of two fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and seven comparative agents against recent clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia using two surveillance strategies: 1) centralized in vitro susceptibility testing of isolates collected from 27 hospital laboratories across the United States and 2) analysis of data from The Surveillance Network Database-USA, an electronic surveillance network comprising more than 200 laboratories nationwide. Regardless of the surveillance method, Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii demonstrated similar rates of susceptibility to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Susceptibilities to the fluoroquinolones approached or exceeded 90% for all Enterobacteriaceae except Providencia spp. (</=65%). Approximately 70% of P. aeruginosa and 50% of A. baumanii isolates were susceptible to both fluoroquinolones. Among S. maltophilia isolates, 50% more isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. Overall, the rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility among Enterobacteriaceae was 8.7%, with fluoroquinolone resistance rates notably higher among ceftazidime-nonsusceptible isolates than ceftazidime-susceptible ones. Multidrug-resistant isolates were present among all species tested but were most prevalent for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. No gram-negative isolates resistant only to a fluoroquinolone were encountered, regardless of species. Thus, while levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin have maintained potent activity against Enterobacteriaceae, the potential for fluoroquinolone resistance, the apparent association between fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance, and the presence of multidrug resistance in every species examined emphasize the need to maintain active surveillance of resistance patterns among gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Impact of BAL in the management of pneumonia with treatment failure: positivity of BAL culture under antibiotic therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is responsible for 50% of antibiotics prescribed in ICUs. Treatment failure, ie, absence of improvement or clinical deterioration under antibiotic therapy, presents a dilemma to physicians. BAL is an invasive method validated for etiologic diagnosis in pneumonia. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in ICU patients the impact of BAL in the etiologic diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of pneumonia with treatment failure. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: Nonsurgical, medical ICU of a university hospital in Brazil. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two episodes of pneumonia treated for at least 72 h without clinical improvement in 53 patients hospitalized for diverse clinical emergencies. Mean duration of hospitalization was 14.2 days. Mean duration of previous antibiotic therapy was 11.4 days. INTERVENTIONS: Bronchoscopy and BAL were performed in each episode. BAL fluid was cultivated for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; the cutoff considered positive was 10(4) cfu/mL; 10(3) cfu/mL was also analyzed if under treatment. Pneumocystis carinii, fungi, Legionella spp, and Mycobacterium spp were also researched. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 62 BAL were performed under antibiotics. The results showed positivity in 45 of 62 (72.6%); 42 of the 45 positive episodes (93.3%) had > 10(4) cfu/mL. The three cases with between 10(3) and 10(4) cfu/mL were considered positive and were treated according to BAL cultures. The main agents were Acinetobacter baumannii (37.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.7%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; 16.1%); 46.7% of the episodes (21 of 45) were polymicrobial. BAL results directed a change of therapy in 34 episodes (54.8%). Overall mortality was 43.5%. There was no difference in mortality among positives, negatives, and patients who changed therapy guided by BAL culture. CONCLUSIONS: (1) BAL fluid examination was positive in 45 of 62 episodes (72.6%), with 58 of 62 BAL performed under antibiotics. This suggests that BAL may be a sensitive diagnostic method for treatment failures of clinically diagnosed pneumonias, even if performed under antibiotics; (2) the main pathogens in our study were A baumannii, P aeruginosa, and MRSA, and approximately 45% of infections were polymicrobial; (3) BAL culture results directed a change of therapy in 75.6% of positive episodes (34 of 45) and in 54.8% of all episodes of treatment failure (34 of 62); and (4) there was no difference in mortality among positives, negatives, and patients who changed therapy guided by BAL culture.
TI  - Carbapenemases: a problem in waiting?
AB  - Carbapenems are stable to most prevalent beta-lactamases, and chromosomal carbapenemases are restricted to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to a few Bacteroides fragilis, and to rare pathogens. Nevertheless, an acquired metallo-beta-lactamase called IMP-1 is beginning to emerge in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Japan, and has also been found in isolates from Singapore. Furthermore, IMP-producing Acinetobacter spp. have been identified in Italy and Hong Kong. Recently a second group of acquired metallo-carbapenemases, the VIM types, has been recorded from P. aeruginosa isolates in five Eurasian countries. Weak carbapenemases belonging to molecular class D are emerging in A. baumannii world-wide, with two sub-groups apparent. A few acquired carbapenemases belonging to molecular class A also have been reported. Finally it has also been shown that enzymes with feeble carbapenemase activity (e.g. AmpC types and some SHV enzymes) may confer resistance in exceptionally impermeable strains; counterwise, even potent carbapenemases, such as IMP-1, may only give a small reduction in susceptibility in Enterobacteriaceae that lack permeability lesions. Is the emergence of carbapenemase a problem waiting to happen?
TI  - Molecular surveillance of European quinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. using automated ribotyping.
AB  - Nosocomial isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. exhibit high rates of resistance to antibiotics and are often multidrug resistant. In a previous study (D. Milatovic, A. Fluit, S. Brisse, J. Verhoef, and F. J. Schmitz, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 44:1102-1107, 2000), isolates of these species that were resistant to sitafloxacin, a new advanced-generation fluoroquinolone with a high potency and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, were found in high proportion in 23 European hospitals. Here, we investigate the clonal diversity of the 155 P. aeruginosa and 145 Acinetobacter spp. sitafloxacin-resistant isolates from that study by automated ribotyping. Numerous ribogroups (sets of isolates with indistinguishable ribotypes) were found among isolates of P. aeruginosa (n = 34) and Acinetobacter spp. (n = 16), but the majority of the isolates belonged to a limited number of major ribogroups. Sitafloxacin-resistant isolates (MICs > 2 mg/liter, used as a provisional breakpoint) showed increased concomitant resistance to piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, amikacin, gentamicin, and imipenem. The major ribogroups were repeatedly found in isolates from several European hospitals; these isolates showed higher levels of resistance to gentamicin and imipenem, and some of them appeared to correspond to previously described multidrug-resistant international clones of P. aeruginosa (serotype O:12) and Acinetobacter baumannii (clones I and II). Automated ribotyping, when used in combination with more discriminatory typing methods, may be a convenient library typing system for monitoring future epidemiological dynamics of geographically widespread multidrug-resistant bacterial clones.
TI  - [Non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli: distribution in clinical specimens and antimicrobial susceptibility].
AB  - In the present work was studied the prevalence, distribution in clinical specimens, and antimicrobial susceptibility of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) from patients attended at Hospital "Angela I. de Llano" (Corrientes, Argentina). A total of 125 strains of NFGNB were recovered from various clinical specimens from July, 1997 to December, 1998. Isolates were identified by classical biochemical tests. Drug sensitivity was performed by standard methods with cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), piperacillin (PIP), ampicillin-sulbactam (AMS), piperacillin/tazobactam (TAZ), imipenem (IMP), amikacin (AKN), gentamicin (GEN) and ciprofloxacin (CIP). The most common isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48.8%); Acinetobacter baumannii (16.8%), Acinetobacter spp. (6.4%), Chryseobacterium spp. (5.6%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4%), and others (18.4%). Most of them were recovered from respiratory secretions (36.0%), and urine (26.4%). IMP was the most effective antimicrobial. Many species of NFGNB showed resistance to several antibiotics tested (CTX, GEN, AMS, and CIP). Due to multiresistance found by more prevalent NFGNB, constant survey of antibacterial sensibility are essential for a correct control and management of nosocomial infections, and ambulatory patients with some risk factors.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefepime in the treatment of serious bacterial infections  in hospitalized adult patients.
AB  - Proper and timely choice of the antibiotic therapy for the management of infection in hospitalized patients is an immense challenge to the clinician. A newly developed extended-spectrum fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime, has been shown to have good activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. In order to further establish the efficacy and safety of cefepime in the treatment of adult hospitalized patients in Taiwan, we reviewed the medical records of all patients who received cefepime therapy for more than 72 h at the National Taiwan University Hospital during the period from January 1999 to April 1999. A total of 55 patients were treated with cefepime during this period. Thirty-two of them were males and 23 were females. Their ages ranged from 16 to 94 years old (average, 67). All had severe infections with a mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of 18. More than half (56%) of the infections were nosocomial. The most common infections included pulmonary infection (49%), intra-abdominal infection (27%), skin and soft tissue infection (15%), febrile neutropenia (7%), and intravascular device infection (5%). All but one of the patients (98%) had pre-existing medical disease. Malignancy (49%) was the most common underlying illness. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23 isolates) and Enterobacter cloacae (21) were the most common pathogens causing infections. Thirty-one (58%) of the patients were effectively treated with cefepime. Twenty of the patients died during the study period with most deaths attributable to persistent microbial infection and superinfection, especially Acinetobacter baumannii and fungal infection. Adverse effects developed in six patients, including eosinophilia (3 patients), leukopenia (2), skin rash (1), and drug related fever (1), but all were mild and transient. The results of this study show that cefepime is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of adult patients with severe infection in Taiwan.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the in vitro activity of three combinations of beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors: piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid and ampicillin/sulbactam.
AB  - Recently, two new combinations of Beta-lactam antibiotics with Beta-lactamase inhibitors became commercially available in Brazil: piperacillin/tazobactam and ampicillin/sulbactam. This study was designed to assess and compare the in-vitro activity of these new compounds, as well as that of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, against bacteria isolated in our environment. A total of 749 bacteria isolated at Sao Paulo Hospital were tested using the disk diffusion method, in compliance with NCCLS standardization, using strict quality control. Only one sample per patient was included in the study. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus samples were not included in this study. Of the total samples tested, 84.5% were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam, 81.2% to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, and 77.6% to ampicillin/sulbactam. Piperacillin/tazobactam was also found to be the most active combination of the three against Enterobacteriaceae ( n = 312), inhibiting 91.7% of the bacteria tested. Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid was active against 85.8% of the Enterobacteriaceae, while ampicillin/sulbactam inhibited 83.2% of the samples. This order of the spectrum of action (piperacillin/tazobactam > ticarcillin/clavulanic acid >ampicillin/sulbactam )was maintained for the majority of Enterobacteriaceae species analyzed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( n = 117) showed extremely high resistance to the three combinations. Piperacillin/tazobactam was active against 61.5% of the samples, while ticarcillin/clavulanic acid was active against 56.4% of the samples of this species. The activity of ampicillin/sulbactam against P. aeruginosa was extremely low; however, this was the most active combination against Acinetobacter baumannii ( 87.0% susceptibility). Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active combination against Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas )maltophilia (100% susceptibility) and Burkholderia cepacia (90.9% susceptibility). The three combinations showed excellent activity against the Gram-positive cocci tested (97.3% to 98.2% susceptibility). In sum, piperacillin/tazobactam was more active against all Gram-negative species than the other two combinations, with the exception of A. baumannii, and showed similar activity against Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - High prevalence of antibiotic resistance of common pathogenic bacteria in Taiwan. The Antibiotic Resistance Study Group of the Infectious Disease Society of the Republic of China.
AB  - We analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibilities of all clinical isolates of 14 common pathogenic bacteria recovered from patients in eight medical centers in Taiwan during 1995 and 1996. Susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents was tested by the disk diffusion method as recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 59.3% and 62% were oxacillin-resistant in 1995 and 1996, respectively, whereas 63.2% of the coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates during the study period were oxacillin-resistant. The rate of penicillin-resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was 39.7% in 1995 and 53.7% in 1996. Macrolide-resistance was found in 71.4%, 42.1%, and 46.7% of S. pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci, respectively, in 1996. Less than 2% of the enterococcal isolates were vancomycin resistant, but 77% of them were gentamicin resistant. Resistance to gentamicin was also common in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Various degrees of resistance to ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalosporins, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin were detected in Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii. More than 55% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates were ampicillin resistant. In summary, resistance to many antimicrobial agents in various common pathogenic bacteria is very common in Taiwan. Our results implicate that antibiotic resistance in the developing countries need to be monitored closely.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Failure of an automated blood culture system to detect nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - During a 1-year study we observed that both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles from patients were negative by the BacT/Alert system during a 7-day incubation period. However, upon subcultivation of negative bottles, growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detectable. In an attempt to explain this observation, aerobic BacT/Alert Fan bottles were seeded with a defined inoculum (0.5 McFarland standard; 1 ml) of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, or Acinetobacter baumannii. Half of the inoculated bottles were loaded into the BacT/Alert system immediately, and the remainder were preincubated for 4, 8, 16, and 24 h at 36 degrees C. With preincubation all bottles seeded with the Enterobacteriaceae signaled positive during the next 1.5 h. Organisms in bottles seeded with the nonfermentative species P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii remained undetected by the BacT/Alert system for 7 days. S. maltophilia was detected if the preincubation time was equal or less than 8 h. Without preincubation all bottles seeded with the Enterobacteriaceae or nonfermentative species signaled positive. Since nonfermentative species seem to enter a state of bacteriostasis within the preincubation period, we reasoned that an unknown factor is consumed. Accordingly, a smaller inoculum should allow the detection of nonfermentative species, even after preincubation, and serial dilutions of P. aeruginosa were detected in preincubated bottles. In this case preincubated bottles signaled positive faster than bottles without preincubation. We conclude that all bottles from clinical settings should be subcultured prior to loading to avoid false negatives. An alternative may be preincubation at room temperature.
TI  - Evaluation of Acinetobacter baumannii infection and colonization, and antimicrobial treatment patterns in an urban teaching hospital.
AB  - In 1990 there was a sudden increase in the incidence of colonization and infection due to Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) in our intensive care units (ICUs). The isolates were multiply resistant to beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics, but remained susceptible to imipenem, amikacin, and ampicillin-sulbactam. We examined the frequency of infection and colonization with AB and the effects of increased imipenem and amikacin therapy on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We also used disease-matched controls to determine the clinical and financial impacts of treating colonization. All patients with at least one AB isolate from January-December 1992 were identified retrospectively and classified as infected or colonized based on published Centers for Disease Control criteria; the control group was selected from a computerized medical records data base matching primary diagnostic codes (102 patients both groups). The 102 patients yielded 140 isolates, 124 resistant AB and 16 sensitive AB. Thirty three patients were infected, 69 colonized. Mortality correlated with APACHE II scores. Patients acquired the organism approximately 2 weeks after admission; they had a mean ICU stay of 27.35 days, compared with 5.53 days for controls. Patients with positive AB cultures required significantly more use of ventilators than those with negative AB cultures. They also had significantly longer hospital stay, more bed transfers, greater duration and number of antibiotics, and higher hospital and pharmacy charges. Unnecessary treatment for colonization with either imipenem or amikacin resulted in a substantial decrease of P. aeruginosa susceptibility to each agent. The financial impact of treating colonization was significant and is a potential area for cost avoidance. Our results emphasize the need to extubate and move patients to non-ICU beds as soon as possible to decrease the risk of nosocomial infection. It also highlights the need to avoid treating colonization, thus avoiding unnecessary antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adult post-neurosurgical patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM) in adult postneurosurgical patients. METHODS: Thirty adult patients with GNBM were included in this study. Their clinical features, laboratory data, prognostic factors, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. The patients were 22 males and 8 females, aged 17-72 years. Seven had community-acquired infections and 23 had nosocomial infections. Two patients were associated with brain abscess. RESULTS: The pathogens found in the 30 GNBM patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and some rare pathogens including Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis. Among these 30 patients, 8 patients with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant GNBM were identified since 1994; all infections were nosocomially acquired. Appropriate antibiotics were given to 22 patients. Eight patients did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. All eight died. The mortality rate in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 14%. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an increase of GNBM in postneurosurgical patients in recent years. In addition, the emergence of strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in this specific group of patients has also been noted in recent years, and has become a great therapeutic challenge. We noted many prognostic factors in postneurosurgical patients in this study; however, appropriate antibiotic therapy and initial consciousness level are the most significant ones. Therefore, in cases of postneurosurgical patients with nosocomially acquired GNBM, the possibility of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be strongly suspected. Early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed in this potentially fatal disease.
TI  - Influences of alternate therapy protocol and continuous infectious disease consultation on antibiotic susceptibility in ICU.
AB  - In this study, the effects of alternate use of imipenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam(CFP/Sul) on antibiotic resistance in the intensive care unit (ICU) were investigated. Between 1 April 1993 and 1 April 1994, the infectious diseases consultant saw patients when required and there was no alternative therapy for antibiotics. For the following 2 years, the same consultant followed up each patient from admission to discharge by daily visits to the ICU and an alternative therapy protocol was initiated. The most common microorganisms were found to be Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, in the two periods. This study demonstrated that sensitivity rates of imipenem, ciprofloxacin and aminoglycosides were improved as a result of this protocol.
TI  - Development of bacterial resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and their clinical use.
AB  - Development of Gram-negative rods resistance to the third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoperazone) in connection with their application at the University Hospital in Olomouc was evaluated in this study. The highest increase in resistance to cefotaxime was detected in Enterobacter cloacae (from 22.9% in 1995 to 49.0% in 1997) and Enterobacter agglomerans strains (28.0% - 40.5%). In addition, increased resistance to ceftazidime in Acinetobacter baumannii (12.5% - 35.1%), Enterobacter aerogenes (7.4% - 20.9%), Enterobacter cloacae (16.7% - 47.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0% - 26.3%) was observed. Finally, the greatest increase in frequency of strains resistant to cefoperazone was observed in E. aerogenes (18.4% - 30.1%), E. agglomerans (31.0% - 52.3%), E. cloacae (35.5% - 47.2%) and Providencia rettgeri (26.5% - 53.2%). A 23.5% increase in third generation cephalosporin use was evident by evaluation of RDDD(ATB) parameters in 1996 and 1997. Corresponding values for individual antibiotics were 26.5% cefotaxime, 20.7% ceftriaxone, and 40.3% ceftazidime increase. However, cefoperazone use decreased by 10.9%.
TI  - Impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  - Evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. However, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. From 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of Acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens to 22 agents. Linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. Only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing D, decreasing %S) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing D, increasing %S). The mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing D, decreasing %S and decreasing D, increasing %S relationships. Multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.
TI  - Intravenous colistin as therapy for nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Sixty nosocomial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, quinolones, penicillins, monobactams, and imipenem were treated with colistin (one patient had two infections that are included as two different cases). The infections were pneumonia (33% of patients), urinary tract infection (20%), primary bloodstream infection (15%), central nervous system infection (8%), peritonitis (7%), catheter-related infection (7%), and otitis media (2%). A good outcome occurred for 35 patients (58%), and three patients died within the first 48 hours of treatment. The poorest results were observed in cases of pneumonia: only five (25%) of 20 had a good outcome. A good outcome occurred for four of five patients with central nervous system infections, although no intrathecal treatment was given. The main adverse effect of treatment was renal failure; 27% of patients with initially normal renal function had renal failure, and renal function worsened in 58% of patients with abnormal baseline creatinine levels. Colistin may be a good therapeutic option for the treatment of severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.
TI  - [Non fermentative gram negative bacilli isolated in a hospital laboratory].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a prospective study on non fermentative gramnegative bacilli, excluded Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolated at Dr. Julio C. Perrando Hospital in Resistencia (Argentina). The goal of this study was to know their frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For bacterial identifications we used biochemical tests. RESULTS: The greatest percentages of non fermentative gramnegative bacilli isolates were found in blood samples (25%), respiratory secretions and urine (23.9%). Acinetobacter baumannii (34.7%), Pseudomonas fluorescens/Pseudomonas putida (15.2%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (9.7%) and Burkholderia cepacia (8.7%) were the non fermentative gramnegative bacilli species most commonly isolated. Distribution of microorganism strains according to samples and area is also assessed. Antimicrobial sensitivity of most commonly isolated non fermentative gramnegative bacilli strain analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that non fermentative gramnegative bacilli are most frequently present in hospitalized that in outpatients and antibacterial therapy must be provided according to bacteriological information.
TI  - [Treatment of pneumonia in hospitalized patients--results of a multicenter study  using a fourth-generation cephalosporin (cefepime)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of cefepime in severe pneumonia of hospitalized patients. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A prospective, multicenter, open trial was performed with 148 patients (62 patients with nosocomial pneumonia; 34 with community-acquired pneumonia and 52 undefined forms). Cefepime was intravenously administered (1,000 to 2,000 mg every 12 hours), and doses were adjusted for renal function. The efficacy endpoint was clinical response at 48 hours after completion of therapy. RESULTS: The mean age was 56.4 +/- 20.31 years. The most common bacterias isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia were: 5 (8.06%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 7 (11.29%) Pseudomonas sp.; 6 (9.68%) Klebsiella sp.; 3 (4.84%) E. coli; 2 (3.23%) Acinetobacter baumannii; 3 (4.84%) Staphylococcus aureus; 3 (4.84%) Streptococcus pneumoniae; 5 (8.06%) others. The most common isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia were: 2 (5.88%) Streptococcus pneumoniae; 1 (2.94%) S. aureus; 2 (5.88%) P. aeruginosa and 2 (5.88%) K. pneumoniae. Clinical efficacy was demonstrated in 137/148 (92.56%) of the cases since improvement was obtained in 20.27% and healing in 72.29%. Failure of the treatment was observed in 10 patients (6.75%) and one patient the evaluation was not possible. Adverse events were reported for 5/148 patients (3.38%). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cefepime was safe and effective for treatment of severe pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Variations in etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia across four treatment sites: implications for antimicrobial prescribing practices.
AB  - This retrospective multicenter study compared microorganisms documented by quantitative cultures from bronchoscopic samples in episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) from three different institutions in Barcelona (B), Montevideo (M), and Seville (S). The observations were compared with the findings reported by Trouillet and coworkers (AJRCCM 1998;157:531-539) in Paris (P). The objective was to evaluate whether a classification of etiologies of VAP in four groups, based on the number of ventilation days and previous antimicrobial use, might contribute to establishing generalized guidelines for empirical therapy. Significant variations in etiologies (p < 0.05) were found in all of the microorganisms isolated from VAP episodes across three treatment sites when compared with the reference site (P). In Group 1 (< 7 d and absence of antibiotics), Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained extremely infrequent (3 of 89, 3.3%) in the joint category, whereas the incidence of Acinetobacter baumannii was significantly higher, owing to M findings. On the other hand, one site (B) had a significantly lower incidence of multiresistant pathogens (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] and nonfermenters other than P. aeruginosa), even in Group 2 (< 7 d and antibiotics), Group 3 (>/= 7 d and absence of antibiotics), and Group 4 (antibiotics and >/= 7 days). Similar findings were documented when episodes were grouped according to Groups 1 and 3 of the ATS guidelines. We conclude that causes of VAP varied markedly across four treatment sites, resulting in the need for large-scale variations in antimicrobial prescribing practices. Instead of following general recommendations, antimicrobial prescribing practices for VAP should be based on up-to-date information of the pattern of multiresistant isolates from each institution.
TI  - Six-year prospective study of risk and prognostic factors in patients with nosocomial sepsis caused by Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - In this prospective study, the risk factors associated with nosocomial sepsis Caused by Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared. Prior use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, urinary tract catheter, prior surgery, and mechanical ventilation were significantly associated with nosocomial sepsis caused by Acinetobacter baumannii. The mean prognostic factors significantly associated with mortality were known focus of infection, multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and inappropriate antibiotic treatment. Adequate knowledge of these findings is important to ensure appropriate management of patients and rational use of antibiotics.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the fluoroquinolone,  levofloxacin, against hospital isolates of bacteria. MICs of levofloxacin were determined for 2154 strains by agar dilution. Breakpoints for susceptibility testing were calculated using the agar diffusion technique with 5 micrograms discs. The activity of levofloxacin against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae (n = 668) was higher (MIC50/90 0.06-0.12 mg/L) than previously reported for ofloxacin. As seen with other fluoroquinolones, this activity was reduced against nalidixic acid-resistant and pefloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains (MIC 1-8 mg/L). MICs for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 104) were between 0.12 and 128 mg/L. Levofloxacin had good activity against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12; MIC 0.06-0.25 mg/L), but the activity was reduced against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-resistant strains (n = 80; MIC 1-32 mg/L). Haemophilus influenzae (n = 70), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 47) and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 64) were inhibited by low concentrations of levofloxacin (MICs 0.016-0.03 mg/L, 0.03-0.12 mg/L) and 0.03-0.12 mg/L, respectively). Clostridium perfringens (n = 23; MIC 0.25-1 mg/L) was more susceptible than Bacteroides fragilis (n = 60; MIC 0.5-4 mg/L). Levofloxacin showed superior activity compared with ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (n = 107; MIC 0.03-0.5 mg/L); the resistant strains (MICs 2-32 mg/L) were usually also resistant to methicillin. Levofloxacin was less effective against enterococci (n = 105; MIC 1-32 mg/L), but streptococci (n = 192) and pneumococci (n = 129), including 58 penicillin-non-susceptible strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (MICs 0.5-2 mg/L). According to the regression curve, zone diameters were usually 20-22 mm, 17-19 mm and 15-16 mm for MICs of 1, 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively. In conclusion, this study, performed on a large number of strains, confirms the superior anti-bacterial activity of levofloxacin compared with ofloxacin, especially against pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections.
TI  - The global epidemiology of resistance to ciprofloxacin and the changing nature of antibiotic resistance: a 10 year perspective.
AB  - Many studies have examined the in-vitro activity of ciprofloxacin. The results are for the most part encouraging but we must guard against complacency. Levels of ciprofloxacin resistance vary geographically, while some predictably difficult-to-treat organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii present challenges globally. The emergence of resistance in species previously exquisitely sensitive to ciprofloxacin, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, in countries associated with 'pirate' production and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials represents a major challenge. Ciprofloxacin continues to show excellent activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catharralis. In general, ciprofloxacin shows good activity against Enterobacteriaceae although the emergence of reduced susceptibility and, sometimes, quinolone resistance in multi-resistant isolates should be noted.
TI  - Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of bacteria in 1997.
AB  - Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are known to be prevalent in tertiary-care hospitals in Korea. Twenty hospitals participated to this surveillance to determine the nationwide prevalence of resistance bacteria in 1997. Seven per cent and 26% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporin. Increased resistance rates, 19% of Acinetobacter baumannii to ampicillin/sulbactam, and 17% of Pseudomonas aeruginoa to imipenem, were noted. The resistance rate to fluoroquinolone rose to 24% in E. coli, 56% in A. baumannii and 42% in P. aeruginosa. Mean resistance rates were similar in all hospital groups: about 17% of P. aeruginosa to imipenem, 50% of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin, 70% of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, and 70% of pneumococci to penicillin. In conclusion, nosocomial pathogens and problem resistant organisms are prevalent in smaller hospitals too, indicating nosocomial spread is a significant cause of the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria in Korea.
TI  - Bacteriological monitoring in the Prague Burns Center.
AB  - The microbiological aspect of the prevention of nosocomial infections at the Burn Center consists primarily in the surveillance of bacterial flora and its antibiotical resistance. The Prague Burn Center is regularly monitoring the microbial flora. Patients are examined not only by the conventional methods of taking swabs of burned sites, but also by printing method, which allows a semiquantitative assessment of the colonization of burned areas. Simultaneously, investigation of bacterial contamination in the external environment of the department is carried out and the colonization of nursing staff is investigated. In all isolated strains the sensitivity to antibiotics is examined; this is significant from the point of view of current knowledge about therapeutic possibilities and for the antibiotic policy. The typing of bacterial strains makes possible to determine their epidemiological markers, and thus to investigate their spread within the department. The most frequent isolate is S. aureus and the prevalence of MRSA is relatively high. Among gramnegative rods the strains of P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae are most often isolated. Various typing methods revealed endemic spread of particular strains of rarely isolated species (E. agglomerans, S. marcescens, A. baumannii, etc.).
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - [Occurrence of gram-negative non-fermenting rods in hemocultures and their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents].
AB  - In the period from January 1993 to June 1996 were at the Department of Microbiology of the University Hospital in Olomouc 122 strains of Gram-negative nonfermentative rod-shaped bacteria isolated from haemocultures. The majority represented the group of 51 strains of the genus Acinetobacter (41.8%), complex A. calcoaceticus-baumannii (Acb complex). The second largest group were 21 strains (17.2%) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These were followed by 17 strains (13.9%) of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 8 strains (6.6%) of non-Acb complex acinetobacters, 6 strains (4.9%) of Pseudomonas putida and 5 strains (4.1%) of Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The remaining species were represented only by 1-2 strains. In three isolations was the identification impossible. The majority of strains (24.6%) were from the Department of Haematology of the University Hospital in Olomouc. The most frequent diagnoses in patients with positive haemocultures were leukemias and lymphomas (24.6%). The most effective tested antimicrobial agents were ceftazidime (93.4% of sensitive strains) and ofloxacin (91.7%). From the total number of 80 strains detected using the equipment BacT/Alert 120, 22 (27.5%) were isolated repeatedly confirming their role in the etiology of bacteriemic or septic episodes. Because only one blood sample was obtained in 34 cases (58.6%) of the remaining 58 only once detected strains, it was impossible to confirm their etiologic role by repeated isolation. (Tab. 6, Ref. 22.)
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of merocyanine 540: a photosensitizing dye.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of merocyanine 540 (MC 540), a photosensitizing dye previously used to purge malignant cells from autologous bone marrow grafts, was evaluated against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and Candida albicans in the presence and absence of light. In the absence of light, MC 540 demonstrated no antibacterial activity against any of the organisms tested. When combined with increasing intervals of photoillumination, growth inhibition was observed with all Gram-positive organisms tested except Mycobacterium fortuitum. Photosensitizing growth inhibition was also observed with Moraxella catarrhalis but not with any other Gram-negative bacilli including members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophila, or Burkhoderia cepacia. These results suggested that differences in cell wall structure confer resistance to the photodamaging effects of the dye. MC 540 exhibited no antimicrobial activity against C. albicans in the presence or absence of light.
TI  - [A national multicenter study of the in-vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam. The Spanish Piperacillin-Tazobactam Group].
AB  - The action of piperacillin-tazobactam on 4,137 of the 4,364 strains collected in  a Spanish multicenter study involving 46 participating hospitals was studied. The samples were from the following: 41% urine, 18% exuded from wound abscesses, 13% respiratory, 9% blood, 3% peritoneal liquid, and the remainder from other various sources. The gram-negative bacteria included 2,778 strains from 13 genera: Escherichia (1,289), Pseudomonas (451), Proteus (230), Klebsiella (203), Haemophilus (172), Enterobacter (145), Acinetobacter (88), Salmonella (60), Bacteroides (57), Morganella (53), Serratia (46), Citrobacter (46), Stenotrophonomas (23) and Moraxella (21). The gram-positive bacteria were S. aureus (316), E. faecalis (239), S. epidermis (130), S. pneumoniae (115) and Clostridium spp. (12). The global susceptibility of the gram-negatives to piperacillin-tazobactam was 94%: E. coli 98%, P. aeruginosa 92%, and P. mirabilis, Morganella, K. pneumoniae, Serratia and Salmonella spp. all greater than 94%. The susceptibility of other bacteria was as follows: 91% Citrobacter, 77% E. cloacae, 42% A. baumannii, 61% S. maltophilia, 97% E. faecalis, 93% S. epidermidis, 100% M. catarrhalis, 99% H. influenzae and 100% anaerobic bacteria. The action on S. pneumoniae and S. aureus varied according to the susceptibility or lack there of to penicillin or methicillin. In comparison to other antibiotics (piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin), piperacillin-tazobactam was far better than piperacillin alone and better or similar to the others.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from protected bronchopulmonary samples: variation as a function of the previous length of stay in the recovery room].
AB  - We retrospectively reviewed the variation of the organisms recovered from 403 protected bronchopulmonary specimens in three surgical intensive care units according to the time elapsed from admission. The predominant pathogens during the four first days were Haemophilus influenzae (33.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.2%), mostly methicillin susceptible strains, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (14.3%). After the fourth day, they were progressively replaced by typical nosocomial bacteria such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, strains resistant to third generation cephalosporins occurred significantly later than the susceptible strains. These results indicate that the time elapsed from intensive care unit admission has a major influence on the bacteriology of respiratory tract infections, but no clear cut-off point between early-onset and late onset pneumonia is evident.
TI  - [Evaluation of antibacterial activities of various antibiotics against glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - MICs of piperacillin, sulbactam/cefoperazone, minocycline (MINO), gentamicin, amikacin, flomoxef, ceftazidime, cefozopran, cefsulodin and imipenem were determined, against 189 clinical isolated strains of glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative Rods (NFGNR; Acinetobacter baumannii (44), Alcaligenes faecalis (5), Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (25), Burkholderia cepacia (12), Chryseobacterium indologenes (23), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (9), Pseudomonas fluorescens (8), Pseudomonas putida (12), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (51). Most species of these NFGNR show resistance to many antibiotics tested. Among the antibiotics used in this study, the only antibiotic effective against all species of NFGNR tested is MINO. The spectrums of antibacterial activities of various antibiotics determined by MICs may be useful in preliminary test for identification of these NFGNR.
TI  - Resistance mechanisms in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli are still a major concern in compromised individuals. By far the most important of these organisms is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although Acinetobacter baumannii (previously Acinetobacter calcoaceticus), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (previously Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas maltophilia), and Burkholderia cepacia (previously Pseudomonas cepacia) are also of substantative concern because of their similar high intrinsic resistances to antibiotics. The basis for the high intrinsic resistance of these organisms is the lower outer-membrane permeability of these species, coupled with secondary resistance mechanisms such as an inducible cephalosporinase or antibiotic efflux pumps, which take advantage of low outer-membrane permeability. Even a small change in antibiotic susceptibility of these organisms can result in an increase in the MIC of a drug to a level that is greater than the clinically achievable level. In this review, the major mechanisms of resistance observed in the laboratory and clinic are summarized.
TI  - Identification of acinetobacters on blood agar in presence of D-glucose by unique browning effect.
AB  - A positive phenotypic characteristic of glucose-oxidizing acinetobacters was demonstrated with blood agar containing D-glucose. Glucose-oxidizing Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter genospecies 3, Acinetobacter lwoffii, and Acinetobacter genospecies 13 sensu Tjernberg and Ursing caused a unique brown discoloration of media supplemented with 5% blood (of horse, sheep, or human origin) and an aldose sugar (0.22 M D-glucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, D-xylose, or lactose). The browning effect was not observed when a ketose sugar (D-fructose or sucrose) was substituted for the aldose sugar or under high osmolarity in the presence of mannitol, glycerol, or sodium chloride. Other gram-negative nonfermenters (non-glucose-oxidizing acinetobacters, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Flavobacterium spp., and Moraxella spp.) did not cause similar discoloration. This novel browning effect may serve as an alternative trait for identifying glucose-oxidizing acinetobacters.
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Gram negative as well as Gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of Gram positive bacteria is increasing. The objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the Haematological Clinic in 1995. Haemocultures (apparatus Bact/Alert 120, cultivation media Organon-Teknika) and urine were examined. The sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. In blood most frequently Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). In urine the following were detected: Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), Enterococcus sp. (14.5%), Escherichia coli (13.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and Enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). In all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.
TI  - The pattern of burn infection in the Singapore National Burns Centre.
AB  - As part of the multi-pronged strategy in the fight against burn infection, we conducted a retrospective study of the pattern of infection in our burn patients for a period of 15 months from January 1993 to March 1994. We studied culture and sensitivity reports to determine the incidence of each organism, their antibiotic sensitivity patterns and the time interval between the burns injury and the appearance of these organisms. Organisms like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multiply-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii constituted a problem in our patients. Other organisms that were isolated from our patients included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species and Klebsiella species. The infection control measures in our burns centre are aimed at combating the spread of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. This study has helped to influence our antibiotic administration policy for treating infection in our centre based on the sensitivity patterns of the prevailing flora.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by potentially drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - To determine risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by potentially drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and/or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 135 consecutive episodes of VAP observed in a single ICU over a 25-mo period were prospectively studied. For all patients, VAP was diagnosed based on results of bronchoscopic protected specimen brush (> or = 10(3) cfu/ml) and bronchoalveolar lavage (> or = 10(4) cfu/ml) specimens. Seventy-seven episodes were caused by "potentially resistant" bacteria and 58 episodes were caused by "other" organisms. According to logistic regression analysis, three variables among potential factors remained significant: duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) > or = 7 d (odds ratio [OR] = 6.0), prior antibiotic use (OR = 13.5), and prior use of broad-spectrum drugs (third-generation cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and/or imipenem) (OR = 4.1). Distribution of the 245 causative bacteria was analyzed according to four groups defined by prior duration of MV (< 7 or > or = 7 d) and prior use or lack of use (within 15 d) of antibiotics. Although 22 episodes of early-onset VAP in patients receiving no prior antibiotics were caused by antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, 84 episodes of late-onset VAP in patients receiving prior antibiotics were mainly caused by potentially resistant bacteria. Differences in the potential efficacies (ranging from 100% to 11%) against microorganisms of 15 antimicrobial regimens were studied according to classification into these four groups. These findings may provide a more rational basis for selecting the initial therapy of patients suspected of having VAP.
TI  - Impact of tracheotomy on colonization and infection of lower airways in children  requiring long-term ventilation: a prospective observational cohort study.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Determination of the following: (1) colonization and infection  rates in children requiring long-term ventilation initially via a transtracheal tube and subsequently via a tracheotomy; (2) the number of infection episodes per 1,000 ventilation days, during both types of artificial airways; and (3) routes of colonization/infection of the lower airways, ie, whether the pathogenesis was endogenous (via the oropharynx) or exogenous (via the transtracheal tube or tracheotomy). DESIGN: Observational, cohort, prospective study over 2 1/2 years. SETTING: Pediatric ICU (PICU), Royal Liverpool Children's National Health Service Trust of Alder Hey, a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two children requiring long-term mechanical ventilation initially transtracheally and subsequently via a tracheotomy. INTERVENTION: Nil. RESULTS: The lower airways were colonized in 71% of children during transtracheal ventilation; posttracheotomy, this was 95% (p=0.03). Children developed significantly fewer infections following colonization with a microorganism posttracheotomy (8/15 pretracheotomy vs 6/21 posttracheotomy; p=0.013). Throughout the study, there were a total of 17 episodes of infection, all of which were preceded by colonization. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the same four causative pathogens during mechanical ventilation both transtracheally and via tracheotomy. Forty-nine episodes of colonization were observed, 15 pretracheotomy and 34 posttracheotomy; of these, 12 (80%) and 19 episodes (56%), respectively, were primary endogenous, ie, present in the oropharynx on hospital admission and subsequently at tracheotomy. Only one colonization episode (7%) of exogenous pathogenesis was observed during transtracheal intubation, while 12 (35%) (p=0.02) occurred after tracheotomy. An equal number of secondary endogenous colonization episodes (two and three, ie, acquired in the oropharynx after PICU admission and after tracheotomy, respectively, were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Despite a high level of hygiene, exogenous colonization without subsequent infection was common. (2) Although all patients were colonized, the infection rate was lower after tracheotomy. This may be due to enhanced immunity (medically stable) and improved tracheobronchial toilet. (3) Microorganisms in children with tracheotomy differ from those in adults.
TI  - Oropharyngeal or gastric colonization and nosocomial pneumonia in adult intensive care unit patients. A prospective study based on genomic DNA analysis.
AB  - Colonization of the digestive tract has been supposed to be the source of many hospital-acquired infections, especially nosocomial pneumonia. To assess the relationship between oropharyngeal and gastric colonization and subsequent occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia, we prospectively studied 86 ventilated, intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Oropharyngeal or gastric colonizations were detected and quantified on admission and twice weekly during ICU stay. When nosocomial pneumonia was suspected on clinical grounds (new chest X-ray infiltrate and purulent tracheal secretions), diagnosis was assessed on fiberoptic bronchoscopy with quantitative cultures of a protected specimen brush sampling and/or a plugged telescoping catheter sampling yielding > or = 10(3) cfu/ml of at least one microorganism. Bacterial strains responsible for colonization and infection (Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, and Staphylococcus aureus) were compared using pulsed-field electrophoresis. A total of 31 cases (36%) of pneumonia were diagnosed. Oropharyngeal colonization, detected either on admission or from subsequent samples, was a predominant factor of nosocomial pneumonia as compared with gastric colonization. For instance, oropharyngeal colonization with A. baumannii yielded a 7.45-fold estimated increased risk of pneumonia as compared with patients not yet or not identically colonized (p = 0.0004). DNA genomic analysis demonstrated that an identical strain was isolated from oropharyngeal or gastric samples and bronchial samples in all but three cases of pneumonia, due to S. aureus. These findings provide better knowledge of the pathophysiology of nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of cefepime: multicenter study in Aquitaine].
AB  - Over a 6 month-period (1st January to 30th June 1995), the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing routinely performed for beta-lactams against enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter in 7 laboratory hospitals of Aquitaine, have been collected and divided in susceptibility profiles. A total of 9269 strains (7323 enterobacteria, 1667 P. aeruginosa, 279 Acinetobacter) have been examined. On the whole, cefepime (91,5%) and ceftazidime (91,7%) were the most active cephalosporins, followed by cefpirome (87,9%) and cefotaxime (80,4%); imipenem was the most active beta-lactam agent (97,4%). When the strains were divided according to their susceptibility profiles, the advantage of cefepime was shown to be related to its excellent activity against enterobacteria: all strains susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftazidime (CTX/CAZ-S) were susceptible to cefepime, as were most of the strains with an intermediate susceptibility or resistant to these drugs (CTX/CAZ-I/R, approximately 5% of the enterobacteria). The latter strains exhibited a phenotype corresponding either to the overproduction of their chromosomal cephalosporinase (approximately 20% of the species belonging to group 3) or to the synthesis of an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (19% of the strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae). Cefepime was active against 93% of the derepressed mutants of enterobacteria, including 3 imipenem resistant isolates of Enterobacter. CAZ-S strains of P. aeruginosa (84%) were usually susceptible to cefepime (80%), as were 6% of the CAZ-I/R strains. CAZ-S strains of A. baumannii (16.3%) were generally susceptible to cefepime (83%), as were 3.2% of the CAZ-I/R strains.
TI  - [E-test to study small inhibitor concentrations, bacterial diversity and to identify presumptively beta-lactamases in strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii associated with +nosocomial infections].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii are two important nosocomial agents that require permanent testing of their antimicrobial susceptibility. AIM: To use E-test to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations, estimate bacterial diversity and presumably identify B-lactamases of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii isolated from nosocomial infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii isolated in a teaching hospital were analyzed with E-test strips to determine their minimal inhibitory concentrations for different antimicrobials. RESULTS: More than 75% of Acinetobacter baumanii were resistant to Piperacillin, Cefpirome, Cefepime, Gentamicin or Amikacin, 40% of strains were resistant to Ceftazidime, 27 and 53% of isolates had a decreased susceptibility to Meropenem and Piperacillin-tazobactam respectively. Twenty eight to 54% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to Cefepime, Cefpirome, Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin. Eighteen and 10% of strains were resistant to Meropenem and Imipenem respectively. Less than 10% of strains were resistant to Amikacin, Azireonam, Piperacillin-tazobactam or Ceftazidime. Most of beta-lactam resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was associated to decreased susceptibility or resistance to Cefpirome, Cefepime or to Meropenem-Imipenem and did not match clearly with known beta-lactamase profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge of susceptibility of these bacteria responsible for nosocomial infections, will help to plan the appropriate use of antimicrobials.
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of aerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from severe infections in 1992: results of a French multicenter study. Groupe d'Etude d'Infections a bacilles a Gram Negatif (GEIGN)].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic susceptibility of 649 gram-negative bacilli involved in severe infections and isolated in 18 teaching hospitals from January to December 1992 was evaluated. METHODS: Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations were determined by agar dilution method for piperacillin, piperacillin+ tazobactam and imipenem, and by a microdilution method for 11 other antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin). Criteria of Comite Francais de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie were followed for interpretation. Betalactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing and overproduction of cephalosporinase was defined by the resistance phenotype. The main species isolated were Escherichia coli (45%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8%), Salmonella spp. (7.5%), Enterobacter cloacae (4%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (4%). Most of the strains were isolated from blood culture (72.3%), respiratory tract (11.4%) and intraabdominal infections (8.6%). Most of the enterobacteria isolates were susceptible to imipenem, aztreonam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (percentages of susceptibility were respectively 99.3, 98, 98.3 and 96.3); in most of cases clavulanic acid did not entirely restore sensitivity to amoxicillin of penicillinase-producing strains. Among 89 P. aeruginosa strains, 82% were susceptible to imipenem and ceftazidime, 81% to the association piperacillin + tazobactam and 51% to ticarcillin. Resistance rates are very high for Acinetobacter baumannii except for imipenem. CONCLUSION: Production of TEM-type penicillinase and over-production of the chromosomal cephalosporinase are the most widely observed mechanisms of resistance (respectively 22% and 9% of 649 strains). Prevalence of extended spectrum betalactamases was low (1%) and essentially observed for K. pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal effect of a beta-lactam+aminoglycoside combination against  multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are frequently isolated in hospital outbreaks of nosocomial infections. In our hospital, among 1018 strains isolated one year in an intensive care unit, 84 strains (8.3%) of P. aeruginosa and 155 strains (15.2%) of A. baumannii were considered responsible for infections. The major problem related to these bacteria is their multiresistant characteristic which confers great difficulty in treating infections. We carried out a 24 h time-kill study to assess the bactericidal effect of three beta-lactams [imipenem (IPM), ticarcillin+clavulanic acid (TCC), piperacillin+tazobactam (PTB)] in combination with each other and with sulbactam (SUL) and amikacin (AKN) against 8 P. aeruginosa strains and 8 A. baumannii strains. The initial inoculum was 10(6) cfu/ml. Antibiotics were tested at clinically achievable concentrations: TCC (112 mg/l), PTB (100 mg/l), IPM (25 mg/l) and AKN (15 mg/l). The results showed: IMP + TCC + AKN = PTB + SUL + AKN = PTB + TCC + AKN > > IMP + SUL + AKN against P. aeruginosa; and PTB + SUL + AKN = PTB + TCC + AKN > IMP + SUL + AKN or IMP + TCC + AKN against A. baumannii. When infection due to these multiresistant strains was suspected, PTB + AKN combined with either TCC or SUL was bactericidal against both strains. These combinations appeared to be an alternative therapy in the treatment of undocumented nosocomial infections in intensive care units. These in vitro results are being evaluated in patients and seem to give good results for the moment.
TI  - Sinusitis in mechanically ventilated patients and its role in the pathogenesis of nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  - Nosocomial sinusitis is a complication of endotracheal intubation and mechanical  ventilation in critically ill patients. Its incidence is often underestimated because of a lack of clinical signs. It is suspected in patients with nasal discharge or unexplained fever. Its diagnosis is based on radiological examination, by radiograph or computed tomography scan, and microbiological cultures of maxillary sinus aspirate. Maxillary sinusitis is often associated with involvement of the sphenoid, ethmoid, and/or frontal sinuses. Its incidence varies greatly according to diagnostic criteria and the population studied. Infectious sinusitis is less frequent than noninfectious sinusitis, occurring in 20 to 30% of patients intubated for at least seven days. Its incidence is higher in nasotracheally than in orotracheally intubated patients. Other risk factors include nasogastric tubes and head trauma. The main causative agents are gram-negative bacilli, primarily Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacteriaceae, but Staphylococcus aureus and yeasts are also common. Patients with nosocomial sinusitis are more likely to develop pneumonia than those without sinusitis. The sinus provides a bacterial reservoir from which organisms may seed the tracheobronchial tree. The association of sinusitis and pneumonia is mainly due to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The treatment of sinusitis is based on the removal of all nasal tubes, topical decongestants, and maxillary sinus drainage and lavage. The role of intravenous antibiotics is controversial.
TI  - In vitro activities of quinolones, beta-lactams, tobramycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - From 1991 to 1995, 8,975 nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli were isolated from patients at The Ohio State University Medical Center: 71% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14% Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 7.6% Acinetobacter baumannii, and < 2% each of 25 other species. The MICs of trovafloxacin (CP-99,219), ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, imipenem, tobramycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) were determined for 308 isolates, representing 13 species, by a standardized broth microdilution method. The activities of all drugs were species dependent. The fluoroquinolones had inconsistent activity against most species, although several relatively uncommon nonfermenters were consistently susceptible or resistant. Trovafloxacin was considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against S. maltophilia, A. baumannii, and several less common species. Among the beta-lactams, relative activities varied considerably; overall, imipenem had the broadest spectrum of activity but was inactive against S. maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia isolates. Tobramycin and TMP-SMZ had stereotypic spectra of activity. Tobramycin was active against most species except S. maltophilia, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans, Burkholderia spp., and Weeksella virosa. TMP-SMZ was active against most species except P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens-putida. A review of laboratory records indicated few changes in susceptibility patterns from 1991 to 1995; the only clear trend was toward increasing P. aeruginosa resistance to all classes of drugs.
TI  - The epidemiology of acinetobacter infections in Hong Kong.
AB  - A retrospective survey was conducted of the characteristics of acinetobacter infections in Hong Kong--seasonal and geographic distributions, frequency of isolation from various body sites, antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular epidemiology. Most (80%) isolates of Acinetobacter spp. belonged to DNA groups 2 (A. baumannii) or 13, as defined by growth at 44 degrees C. An increased isolation rate in summer was related to higher ambient temperatures. The notion that acinetobacters are opportunist nosocomial pathogens was supported by the body site- and ward-specific distributions, which were similar to those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in marked contrast to those of coagulase-negative staphylococci and Escherichia coli. Typing of Acinetobacter isolates by arbitrary-primed polymerase chain reaction revealed extensive genotypic polymorphism, suggesting that numerous unrelated strains were circulating between patients. In view of the association with a high incidence of polymicrobial bacteraemia and multiresistance to antibiotics, a careful selection of appropriate antibiotics in combination is necessary for empirical therapy of infections caused by Acinetobacter spp.
TI  - [Characteristics of multiresistant gram-negative bacteria and their occurrence at the Medical School Hospital in Olomouc].
AB  - Currently, a persistent growth of bacterial resistance to antibiotics takes place. Multiresistant bacterial strains thus represent a serious danger for therapy in practice. The aim of the study was to characterize the multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria and to judge their antibiograms by using the minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC). At the same time the study evaluates the relations to the most frequent diagnoses and epidemiologic data concerning the occurrence of these strains in different clinical cases treated at individual departments of the Faculty Hospital in Olomouc. Out of the total of 4.988 strains of Gram-negative rods, the number of isolated multiresistant strains reached 316 (6.3%). Individual bacterial species were isolated in the following order: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (23.4%) and Acinetobacter Baumannii complex (Acb complex) (18.7%). The most frequent occurrence of investigated bacteria was registered at the departments in the following order: urology (45.9%), internal medicine (18%), paediatrics (13.6%), and surgery (11.1%). The most frequent diagnoses based on positive cultivation of these bacteria were the infections of the urogenital tract (53.8%), postoperative infections (16.8%), and the infections of the upper respiratory ducts (7.3%). 64.2% of strains were cultivated from urine, 16.1% from pus, and 6.9% from swabs taken from the upper respiratory ducts. (Tab. 8, Ref. 18.).

TI  - [Frequency of clinical isolation of glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods and their susceptibilities to antibacterial agents].
AB  - A comparison was made for frequencies of isolation o glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rods ((G)NF-GNR) from clinical specimens during a period from July, 1986 to June, 1987 (the first period) and that from January, 1994 to December, 1994 (the second period). Also, minimum inhibitory concentrations of principal drugs were determined against these isolates. The obtained results are summarized as follows: 1. Thirty four (34) species of (G)NF-GNR were found from 35,200 clinical specimens in the two periods. Numbers of strains of (G)NF-GNR obtained were 4,575 during the first period and 4,704 during the second period, thus no significant difference existed in numbers of strains isolated in the two periods. 2. Among the 34 species to which the 4,704 strains were classified into, Pseudomonas aeruginosa comprised 68.4%, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 6.9%, Acinetobacter baumannii 5.6%, Burkholderia cepacia 3.1%, Acinetobacter Iwoffii 2.6%, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans 2.4%, Flavobacterium indologenes 1.7%, Pseudomonas putida 1.1%, Acinetobacter junii 1.1% and Moraxella subgenus Moraxella lacunata 0.9%. When these frequencies of isolation were compared with those in the first period, it was found that B. cepacia decreased significantly (P < 0.01) and that S. maltophilia increased significantly (P < 0.001). 3. MIC determinations revealed multiple drug resistance strains in many different species of bacteria. Minocycline, however, were active against many such strains, and ofloxacin was found to have strong antibacterial activity against some strains.
TI  - Emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  - We have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. After eight years of use, 97-100% of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. After six years of use, 94%-100% of Enterobacteriaceae (except Providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of P. stuartii, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa declined from 100% to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. There were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. Enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal MIC of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/L; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/L decreased from 94% to 64%. Imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparison of susceptibility to extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics and ciprofloxacin among gram-negative bacilli isolated from intensive care units.
AB  - The in vitro activities of extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics (including piperacillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, and meropenems) were assessed and compared with the activity of ciprofloxacin against 366 clinical Gram-negative bacilli isolates from the intensive care units of Taichung Veterans General Hospital. The most prevalent species isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The activities of ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, and meropenem against these isolates were comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. Meropenem was found to be the most potent extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic tested and the MIC50s and MIC90s for most of these multiresistant strains were lower than those of imipenem, ceftazidime, and cefepime, except for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics that were still active against S. maltophilia were piperacillin and ceftazidime. More than 50% of Enterobacter spp. were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and piperacillin, but they remained susceptible to carbapenems and cefepime.
TI  - Microbiology of nosocomial sinusitis in intensive care unit patients.
AB  - We performed a 2-year microbiological study of specimens of sinus fluid recovered from patients with suspected nosocomial sinusitis in six intensive care units. Over that period, 103 cases of sinusitis were documented by positive culture. The number of cases varied widely from one unit to another and was particularly high in the neurosurgical unit. Cultures were often polymicrobial. The main pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were far less frequently isolated. Anaerobes and yeasts were often associated with aerobic bacteria. The pathogen involved was also recovered from bronchopulmonary samples in 50 patients and from blood cultures in seven patients.
TI  - Synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. To investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (DES), and ofloxacin (OFL), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. Fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. Time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. Of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between CTX, DES and OFL was demonstrable for 89 (81%). Included in the study were 70 members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of Xanthomonas maltophilia. Additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. Findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. Organisms tested included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (10), Enterococcus faecalis (10), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20). Synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). Less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). Isolates representative of each major group of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. Time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new fluoroquinolone, enoxacin against hospital bacteria and regression curve].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of enoxacin (ENX), a new fluoroquinolone indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections, was determined by agar dilution for 703 bacterial strains isolated in 1993 in 3 university hospitals in order to study its activity against urinary pathogens; in addition, antibiograms by agar diffusion were performed with 5 micrograms disks to calculate the regression curve and the breakpoints for sensitivity testing. Activity of ENX against nalidixic acid (NAL) susceptible (S) Enterobacteriaceae was close to that of other fluoroquinolones (FQ) (MIC 50 and 90: 0.25-0.5 microgram/ml); like for other FQ, this activity was reduced against NAL intermediate and resistant (R) Enterobacteriaceae (8-64) MICs of ENX against P. aeruginosa were between 0.5 and 128 (2- > 128). ENX had also a good activity against NAL-S A. baumannii (0.06-2) but this activity is reduced against NAL-R Acinetobacter (0.5- > 128). ENX showed activity close to the currently available FQ against methicillin susceptible Staphylococci (0.5-8); the resistant strains (32- > 64) are usually methicillin resistant. ENX is less effective against Enterococci (4-128). The coefficient correlation of the regression curve is 0.906. For MIC breakpoints of 1 and 2 micrograms/ml, zone diameter breakpoints should be 22 and 19 mm.
TI  - Identification of Salmonella spp. with Rambach agar in conjunction with the 4-methylumbelliferyl caprylate (MUCAP) fluorescence test.
AB  - The utility of Rambach agar to identify Salmonella spp. was examined relative to  its usefulness in clinical microbiology. Forty-four of 54 (82%) salmonella organisms isolated from faecal cultures and 66 of 82 (84%) salmonella stock cultures produced bright red colour colonies after 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C, whereas 48 of 54 (89%) salmonellae isolated from faecal cultures, and 74 of 82 (90%) salmonella stock cultures, yielded the bright red colour when the incubation time was extended to 48 h. Apart from Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi A the sensitivity of Rambach agar to detect salmonella strains belonging to five serogroups was 83% and 92% after 24 and 48 h of incubation, respectively. In contrast, other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested failed to give the bright red colour, except for one strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and another of Acinetobacter baumannii. The non-salmonella strains either gave a different colour--blue, green or orange--or were colourless. To supplement the use of Rambach agar in the detection of Salm. typhi and Salm. paratyphi A and other late or negative acid-producing salmonella species on this medium, the 4-methylumbelliferyl caprylate fluorescence (MUCAP) test was carried out, and this showed positive results with all the salmonella strains tested. These results suggest that while Rambach agar can not pre-identify Salm. typhi and Salm. paratyphi A, the use of a simple and rapid (MUCAP) test in combination would make it very useful to identify all Salmonella spp. after 24 h incubation.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - [Ciprofloxacin resistance in gram negative bacilli. Epidemiologic aspects].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present was to study the resistance to ciprofloxacin (CIP) in gram negative bacilli (April 1990-March 1992) and to determine the temporary distribution of the resistant strains by species, samples and departments. METHODS: Seven thousand four hundred seventy-eight samples were studied. The identification and determination of the sensitivity was performed by the PASCO (Difco) system. Haemophilus spp. and Campylobacter spp. were excluded from the study. The microorganisms with CIM 2 mg/l were considered as resistant (CIPr). RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-one CIPr isolations were identified (6.4%). With regard to the percentage of resistant strains, the species with the highest were: Providencia stuartii (50%); Pseudomonas cepacia (44.4%); Xanthomonas maltophilia (26.9%); Acinetobacter baumannii (25.8%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%); Citrobacter freundii (12.5%); Serratia marcescens (8.4%); Enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and Escherichia coli (4.3%). With respect to the absolute number of resistant strains, the most frequent resistant strains were: P. aeruginosa (205), E. coli (144), and A. baumannii (41). Isolation of E. coli and A. baumannii CIPr increased over the study period. Forty-four point five percent of the E. coli CIPr were of extrahospitalary origin; most of the A. baumannii (92.9%) and P. aeruginosa (77.6%) in contrast were of intrahospitalary origin. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and A. baumannii are the most frequently resistant species. The frequency of isolation of resistant strains of E. coli and A. baumannii significantly increased (p < 0.001) over the two years of the study.
TI  - In vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new quinolone.
AB  - MICs of Bay y 3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, cefuroxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 878 recent clinical isolates were determined by broth microdilution methods. Among the three quinolones, Bay y 3118 was the most active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, gram-positive cocci, and anaerobes; MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) and MIC90s were < or = 0.015 and < or = 0.015, < or = 0.015 and < or = 0.015, 0.03 and 2, 0.25 and 0.5, 0.06 and 1, and 0.12 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. For gram-positive cocci and anaerobes, these values were 16- to 32-fold (4 to 5 log2 dilution steps) lower than those for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Bay y 3118 was similar in activity to ciprofloxacin and more active than ofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Bay y 3118 MIC50s and MIC90s were 0.03 and 0.25 and 0.5 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. Scattergrams and regression analyses comparing quinolone MICs indicated that, despite differences in activity, organisms relatively susceptible to one were relatively susceptible to all and organisms relatively resistant to one were relatively resistant to all. However, the greater in vitro activity of Bay y 3118 was most pronounced against relatively resistant organisms. Pending pharmacokinetic and safety data for Bay y 3118, there is reasonable anticipation that its enhanced activity against gram-positive cocci and anaerobes would broaden the clinical utility of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Activity of imipenem, third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and ciprofloxacin against multi-resistant gram-negative bacilli isolated from Chilean hospitals.
AB  - The activity of imipenem against nosocomial strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus resistant to some third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, or ciprofloxacin was assessed. These strains represent the most prevalent multi-resistant nosocomial microorganisms in Chile since they were isolated from clinical specimens in 11 Chilean hospitals. A high proportion of the strains were resistant to several beta-lactams, yet all strains of K. pneumoniae and Acinetobacter spp. were susceptible to imipenem; resistance was exhibited by only one strain of P. aeruginosa and 16 strains of S. aureus. Synergy between cefotaxime and clavulanic acid was found in almost all strains of K. pneumoniae, suggesting the presence of plasmid-coded beta-lactamases, probably with extended-spectrum activity. Killing A. baumannii by imipenem was rapid, but slower for P. aeruginosa. Killing of K. pneumoniae was also somewhat slower despite the lower MIC of imipenem for this strain. Bactericidal activity was even slower against one strain of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. These results suggest that imipenem would be an adequate alternative to other broad-spectrum agents in the treatment of infections due to nosocomial multi-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adults: a recent six-year experience.
AB  - Thirty-eight cases of Gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adults have been identified over the past six years at the Veterans General Hospital, Taipei. Twenty cases were associated with head trauma and/or neurosurgery, while 18 cases occurred spontaneously. The overall mortality was 58%. Within the spontaneous meningitis group, 13 cases (72%) were due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, 11 cases (61%) were associated with bacteremia and eight cases (44%) with diabetes mellitus. In spite of the administration of third-generation cephalosporins, most cases of spontaneous meningitis (15 patients, 83%) died soon after diagnosis. In contrast, the clinical course for the postneurosurgical patients was more benign. Only seven patients (35%) died during the course of therapy. Common causative agents in postneurosurgical patients included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli. External cerebrospinal fluid drainage devices were thought to be the most important predisposing factor in Gram-negative bacillary meningitis in the postneurosurgical patients. Factors that adversely influenced the mortality of Gram-negative bacillary meningitis included the presence of bacteremia, shock, deep coma and a high initial cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte count.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide profile typing as a technique for comparative typing of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We have applied the technique of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to the typing of 124 isolates of 12 gram-negative species from suspected outbreaks of infection. LPS was prepared by proteinase K digestion or micro-phenol-water extraction. A total of 11 of the 12 species gave clear ladder band profiles, the exception being Acinetobacter baumannii. When compared with conventional typing for Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, LPS profile type alone was sufficient to allow relatedness or distinguishability of isolates to be established, and this was corroborated by serotype and phage type data. Serologically nontypeable isolates invariably lacked O repeating units and thus could not be classified by their silver stain profile. We conclude that LPS profiling is useful for the epidemiological investigation of small clusters of isolates in order to determine whether or not cross-infection between patients has occurred.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, and ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990 against 1640 isolates belonging to 117 bacterial species. Against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Bay y 3118 was as active as CI-960 and CI-990, up to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and tosufloxacin and up to 16-fold more active than sparfloxacin. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs > or = 2 mg/L) were sensitive to Bay y 3118. With the exception of ciprofloxacin which was less active, the activities of Bay y 3118 and the other comparator compounds were similar against Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter genospecies 3 and Acinetobacter strain 84. Bay y 3118 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates at concentrations comparable with those of ciprofloxacin. However, non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas spp. were four times more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to ciprofloxacin. All of the agents tested were equally active against Haemophilus, Moraxella, Neisseria and Bordetella spp. Against staphylococci, Bay y 3118 was the most active compound, followed jointly by CI-990, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and tosufloxacin, and then ciprofloxacin. Bay y 3118 remained highly active against Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to ciprofloxacin; the MIC90 (0.5 mg/L) was 16-fold less than that of CI-990 and sparfloxacin, 32-fold less than that of CI-960 and 128-fold less than that of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Against haemolytic and non-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis, Bay y 3118 was two- to 16-fold more active than the other compounds. It had only moderate activity against Listeria spp., but this was superior to that of all the other compounds tested. Bay y 3118 was also the most active agent overall against anaerobic bacteria, although CI-960 and CI-990 had slightly better activity against Gardnerella vaginalis. It inhibited Mycobacterium spp. other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium flavescens, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium fortuitum) at concentrations < or = 0.06-4 mg/L and was between two- and 128-fold more active than the other compounds against these isolates; the two strains each of Mycobacterium terrae and Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum were resistant to Bay y 3118. In this study, Bay y 3118 was shown to be the most active and most broad-spectrum of the new quinolone and naphthyridine derivatives.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new oral cephalosporin, ceftibuten. Results of a multicenter study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ceftibuten (CBT) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,416 bacterial strains isolated in 5 hospitals. For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC 50 and 90% were respectively (micrograms/ml): (I) Naturally non beta-lactamase producing species: E. coli 0.12-0.5, Shigella 0.06-0.12 and Salmonella 0.03-0.12, P. mirabilis 0.16-0.03. (II) Chromosomal penicillinase producing species: K. pneumoniae 0.03-0.5 and K. oxytoca 0.03-0.06. (III) Chromosomal cephalosporin producing species: E. cloacae and C. freundii 1- greater than 128: S. marcescens 0.25-2; indole + Proteus 0.06-0.12. Activity of CBT was not modified on plasmid mediated penicillinase producing strains; however, CBT was inactive on cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains, and its activity was variably reduced on broad spectrum beta-lactamases producing strains. CBT was inactive on P. aeruginosa (MIC greater than or equal to 32) and on A. baumannii (8- greater than 128). Haemophilus and Gonococci, regardless on beta-lactamase production status, were very susceptible to CBT (MIC 50 and 90%: 0.06-0.5 and 0.016-0.06); it is the same situation for Meningococci; B. catarrhalis was generally inhibited by 0.03 to 2 (strains susceptible to penicillin G) and 0.12 to 16 (strains resistant to penicillin G). CBT was inactive on Staphylococci. Enterococci and Streptococci B were generally resistant; Streptococci A, C, G were inhibited by low concentrations: 0.06 to 1 (MIC 50 and 90%: 0.25-0.5), whereas MIC for other Streptococci 0.12 to 128 (MIC 50 and 90%: 8-128) and for Pneumococci were 0.25 to 16 (4-8). These antibacterial properties particularly against Enterobacteriaceae placed CBT in excellent position among oral cephalosporins.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new fluoroquinolone, temafloxacin, against  hospital isolates. Results of a multicenter study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of temafloxacin (TMF) was determined by  agar dilution for 2,510 bacterial strains isolated in 1989 in 9 university hospitals. Activity of TMF against nalidixic acid (NAL) susceptible (S) Enterobacteriaceae was close to that of other fluoroquinolones (FQ) (mode MIC: 0.06 micrograms/l); like for other FQ, this activity was reduced against NAL intermediate (mode 1) and resistant (R) (mode 4) Enterobacteriaceae. MICs of TMF against P. aeruginosa were between 0.12 and 128 (mode 0.5-1). TMF had also a good activity against NAL S A. baumannii (mode MIC: 0.06-0.12) but this activity is reduced against NAL R Acinetobacter (mode MIC: 16). TMF was highly active against Haemophilus mode MIC: less than or equal to 0.008), Gonococci (mode MIC: 0.008-0.032), Meningococci (mode MIC: 0.08) and B. catarrhalis (mode MIC: 0.016). TMF showed better activity to other fluoroquinolones against methicillin susceptible Staphylococci (mode MIC: 0.06); the resistant strains (mode MIC: 8) are usually methicillin resistant. Comparatively to the currently available FQ, TMF is so more effective against Enterococci (mode MIC: 1), Streptococci (mode MIC: 0.5-1) and Pneumococci (mode MIC: 0.5). Finally, for the anaerobic bacteria, TMF is more active against C. perfringens (mode MIC: 0.5) than against B. fragilis (mode MIC: 2).
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of piperacillin-tazobactam combination on hospital isolates and regression curve].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of piperacillin (P) in combination with  4 micrograms/ml of tazobactam (T) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,245 strains isolated in 4 hospitals. In addition antibiograms by agar diffusion were performed with disks loaded of 75 micrograms of P + 10 micrograms of T. For naturally non beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (E), MIC 50 and 90% of P + T were (microgram/ml): E. coli 1-2; P. mirabilis: 0.5-1; activity was practically identical on plasmid mediated penicillinase (Pase) producing strains. Strains of K. pneumoniae only resistant (R) to amino- and carboxypenicillins (C) had MICs less than or equal to 4 (mode MIC 2); MICs of strains R to cephalothin and/or cefotaxime were 2 to 16 (mode MIC 4). For chromosomal cephalosporinase (Case) producing species, MICs of P + T were less than or equal to 8, including for acquired Pase producing strains, but were greater than or equal to 16 for Case hyperproducing strains. Strains of P. aeruginosa susceptible (S) to C were inhibited by 1 to 16 (with MIC 4) and strains R to C by 8 to greater than 128. MICs were generally 2 to 32 for A. baumannii S to C at 0.12 to greater than 128 for strains R to C. Haemophilus, S or R to ampicillin, were inhibited by 0.008 to 2 (MIC 50 and 90: 0.016-0.12). S. aureus S to methicillin (M), Pase producing on not, were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 (mode MIC 1) and strains R to M by 8 to greater than 128. Activity of P + T for coagulase-Staphylococci was similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  - For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC50s and MIC90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: Escherichia coli 0.12 and 0.5, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, Proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. Klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. Enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, Citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, Serratia marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive Proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and Providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. The activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as N. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC50s and MIC90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were generally resistant: Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (MIC50 and MIC90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium perfringens (MIC50 and MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for Bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). These results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
