TI  - In vitro activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against 502 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In a previous study, we compared HMR 3004 with azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin against 502 anaerobic bacteria using NCCLS-approved procedures. This report extends this study by reporting the activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against these strains. Telithromycin inhibited 10% of Bacteroides fragilis, 50% of other B. fragilis group organisms and 93% of other Bacteroides spp. Telithromycin inhibited all Porphyromonas spp. and 98% of Prevotella spp. Activity against Bilophila wadsworthia (85-96%) was excellent. Telithromycin was not active against the Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium group. Telithromycin inhibited 100% of Clostridium perfringens, 46-56% of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium ramosum and approximately 90% of non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for Actinomyces spp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. The MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for Eubacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium ramosum. The MIC(90) for Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for Prevotella bivia and other Prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC(90) for Fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. The MIC(90)s for the Bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for B. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for Bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. Telithromycin MICs for the B. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than ABT-773 MICs. For all strains, ABT-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
TI  - In vitro activity of DU-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of a new quinolone agent, DU-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-approved Wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of DU-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin, metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. DU-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every group of organisms. MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis (57), other B. fragilis group species (84), Bilophila wadsworthia (15), Clostridium species (27) (including C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum), Fusobacterium nucleatum (16), Fusobacterium mortiferum-F. varium group species (10), Peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and Prevotella species (25).
TI  - In vitro activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. A fastidious facultative anaerobe, Gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. FK037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Mobiluncus spp., G. vaginalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. The MICs of FK037 for 50 and 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of FK037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. The activity of FK037 against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, and Bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Little influence of inoculum size on the activity of FK037 was observed for other isolates tested. Medium pH affected the activity of FK037 against F. varium (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and Bacteroides gracilis (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. FK037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from B. fragilis GAI 0558 and GAI 10150.
