TI  == nonsporulating bacterial species contain dna sequences homologous to the bacillus spore-specific c-protein gene.
AB  == genes for small, acid-soluble spore proteins (sasps) are ubiquitous among the spore-forming bacteria and are expressed only during sporulation. although they perform the function of amino acid storage in spores, the members of the sasp-c multigene family probably serve additional functions, so that similar sequences might be present in non-spore-formers. using the sasp-c gene (ssp-c) as a hybridization probe, restriction digests of whole genomic dna from seven nonsporulating bacterial species were examined for similar sequences. hybridization was found in four species: streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, neisseria sicca, and mycobacterium phlei, indicating the presence of similar sequences in some, but not all, of the non-spore-formers. in each of these positive species, multiple bands hybridized. a 4.5-kb hybridizing fragment  from s. pyogenes and a 9.0-kb hybridizing fragment from m. phlei have been cloned and partially sequenced. these fragments show substantial dna sequence homology to ssp-c and their deduced amino acid sequences show substantial homology to sasp-c.

TI  == comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  == the adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (sabe)  was measured. the species, in order of greatest adhesion, were streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus milleri, streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative streptococcus mitior and  streptococcus salivarius. individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. there was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. the streptococci were more adhesive than strains of escherichia coli and neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  == further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
