TI  == the predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  == purpose: to detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. material and methods: clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. cultures were made from clinical  materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. results: the following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: streptococcus milleri group (smg) (23.8%) [streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), streptococcus mitis (4.7%), streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), prevotella buccae (4.7%), prevotella intermedia (4.7%), actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), rothia denticariosa (4.7%), gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). conclusions: results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. it was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. although no  specific microorganism was found, streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially smg (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.

TI  == odontogenic bacteria in periodontal disease and resistance patterns to common antibiotics used as treatment and prophylaxis in odontology in spain.
AB  == resistance in streptococci or gram-negative bacteria is associated with antibiotic consumption. scarce information exists on the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with periodontitis in countries with high antibiotic consumption, as this is an area in which microbiological testing is not performed in daily practice. the present study was undertaken to explore the susceptibility of bacterial isolates in periodontitis to antibiotics prescribed in odontology in spain as treatment for local infections or prophylaxis for distant focal infections. periodontal samples were  prospectively collected in 48 patients classified by pocket depth of <4 mm and >or=4 mm. species were identified by culture, selecting the five most frequent morphotypes per sample, and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). susceptibility was determined by e-test. a total of 261 isolates were identified: 72.9% patients had streptococcus oralis; 70.8% streptococcus mitis; 60.4% prevotella buccae; 39.6% prevotella denticola; 37.5% fusobacterium nucleatum; 35.4% prevotella intermedia; 25% capnocytophaga spp.; 23% veillonella spp.; 22.9% prevotella melaninogenica and streptococcus sanguis; and <20% other species. streptococcus viridans resistance rates were 0% for amoxicillin, approximately 10% for clindamycin, 9-22% for tetracycline, and for azithromycin ranged from 18.2% for s. sanguis to  47.7% for s. mitis. prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with amoxicillin resistance ranging from 17.1% in p. buccae to 26.3% in p. denticola. metronidazole resistance was <6% in all prevotella species, while clindamycin resistance ranged from 0 to 21.1%. beta-lactamase production was positive in 54.1% prevotella spp., 38.9% f. nucleatum, 30% capnocytophaga spp., and 10% veillonella spp. in this study, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most active antibiotic against all species tested, followed by metronidazole in the case of anaerobes.
