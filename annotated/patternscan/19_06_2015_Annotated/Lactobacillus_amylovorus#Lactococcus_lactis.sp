TI  == a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood.
AB  == background: recent insights into the role of the human microbiota in cognitive and affective functioning have led to the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation may act as an adjuvant strategy to ameliorate or prevent depression. objective: heightened cognitive reactivity to normal, transient changes in sad mood is an established marker of vulnerability to depression and is considered an important target for interventions. the present study aimed to test if a multispecies probiotic containing bifidobacterium bifidum w23, bifidobacterium lactis w52, lactobacillus acidophilus w37, lactobacillus brevis w63, lactobacillus casei w56, lactobacillus salivarius w24, and lactococcus lactis (w19 and w58) may reduce cognitive reactivity in non-depressed individuals. design: in a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, pre- and  post-intervention assessment design, 20 healthy participants without current mood disorder received a 4-week probiotic food-supplement intervention with the multispecies probiotics, while 20 control participants received an inert placebo  for the same period. in the pre- and post-intervention assessment, cognitive reactivity to sad mood was assessed using the revised leiden index of depression  sensitivity scale. results: compared to participants who received the placebo intervention, participants who received the 4-week multispecies probiotics intervention showed a significantly reduced overall cognitive reactivity to sad mood, which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts. conclusion: these results provide the first evidence that the intake of probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood. probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for  depression.

TI  == effects of synbiotics injected in ovo on regulation of immune-related gene expression in adult chickens.
AB  == objective: to determine immunomodulatory effects of synbiotics administered in ovo on immune-related gene expression in adult chickens. animals: 30 green-legged partridgelike chickens. procedures: on incubation day 12, eggs were injected with 3 synbiotics (lactococcus lactis subsp lactis ibb sl1 with raffinose family oligosaccharides [rfos; s1], lactococcus lactis subsp cremoris ibb sc1 with rfos  [s2], and lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus faecium with lactose [s3]). control eggs were injected with rfos prebiotic or saline (0.9% nacl) solution. gene expression of 6 cytokines (interleukin [il]-4, il-6, il-12p40, il-18, interferon [ifn]-beta, and ifn-gamma) and 1 chemokine (il-8) was analyzed in the  cecal tonsils and spleen of 6-week-old chickens by means of reverse transcription quantitative pcr assays. results: gene expression for il-4, il-6, ifn-beta, and il-18 was significantly upregulated in the spleen of chickens in groups s2 and s3. in contrast, il-12 expression was downregulated in group s2 and ifn-gamma expression was downregulated in group s3. expression of il-8 did not change in chickens treated with synbiotics in ovo. gene expression of all cytokines, except for il-18, was downregulated in cecal tonsils. conclusions and clinical relevance: in ovo administration of synbiotics activated the immune system in adult chickens. the intestinal immune system (cecal tonsils) had downregulation of expression for the cytokines evaluated, which indicated an increase in oral tolerance, whereas in the peripheral part of the immune system (spleen), expression of il-4 and il-6 was upregulated. evaluation of immune-related gene expression patterns may be useful when monitoring the effectiveness of synbiotic  selection with respect to immunobiotic properties.

TI  == effect of kcl substitution on bacterial viability of escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and selected probiotics.
AB  == excessive intake of nacl has been associated with the increased risk of several diseases, particularly hypertension. strategies to reduce sodium intake include substitution of nacl with other salts, such as kcl. in this study, the effects of nacl reduction and its substitution with kcl on cell membranes of a cheese starter bacterium (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis), probiotic bacteria (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei), and a pathogenic bacterium (escherichia coli) were investigated using fourier-transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy. a critical nacl concentration that inhibited the viability of e. coli without affecting the viability of probiotic bacteria significantly was determined. to find the critical nacl concentration, de man, rogosa, and sharpe (mrs) broth was supplemented with a range of nacl concentrations [0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0%], and the effect on cell viability and ftir spectra was monitored for all bacteria. a nacl concentration of 2.5% was found to be the critical level of nacl to inhibit e. coli without significantly affecting the viability of most of the probiotic bacteria and the cheese starter bacterium. the ftir spectral analysis also highlighted the changes that occurred mainly in the amide regions upon increasing the nacl concentration from 2.5 to 3.0% in most of  the bacteria. escherichia coli and b. longum were more sensitive to substitution  of nacl with kcl, compared with lb. acidophilus, lb. casei, and lc. lactis ssp. lactis. to evaluate the effect of substitution of nacl with kcl, substitution was carried out at the critical total salt concentration (2.5%, wt/vol) at varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% kcl). the findings suggest that 50% substitution of nacl with kcl, at 2.5% total salt, could inhibit e. coli without  affecting the probiotic bacteria.

TI  == co-culture fermentation of peanut-soy milk for the development of a novel functional beverage.
AB  == most of the commercial probiotic products are dairy-based, and the development of non-dairy probiotic products could be an alternative for new functional products. the peanut-soy milk (psm(1)) was inoculated with six different lactic acid bacteria (lab), including probiotic strains and yeasts and fermentation was accomplished for 24h at 37 degrees c and afterwards, another 24h at +/-4 degrees  c. the pediococcus acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1), lactococcus lactis (cct 0360), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr 32) probiotic lab, and the lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp. bulgaricus (lb 340) yogurt starter culture reached cell concentrations of  about 8.3log cfu/ml during fermentation. however, these strains were not able to  acidify the substrate when inoculated as pure culture. the lactobacillus acidophilus (laca 4) probiotic produced significant amounts of lactic acid (3.35  g/l) and rapidly lowered the ph (4.6). saccharomyces cerevisiae (ufla yffbm 18.03) did not completely consume the available sugars in psm and consequently produced low amounts of ethanol (0.24 g/l). in pure culture, s. cerevisiae (ufla  yffbm 18.03), l. rhamnosus (lr 32), l. acidophilus (laca 4), and p. acidilactici  (ufla bffcx 27.1) promoted the increase of total amino acids (48.02%, 47.32%, 46.21% and, 44.07%, respectively). however, when in co-cultured, the strains consumed the free amino acids favoring their growth, and reaching the population  of 8log cfu/ml in psm. lactic acid production increased, and 12 h was required to reach a ph value of 4.3. in general, the strains were more efficient in the use of available carbohydrates and release of metabolites in co-cultured than in single culture fermentations. an average of 58% and 78% of available carbohydrates was consumed when single and co-cultures were evaluated, respectively. higher lactic acid contents were found in a binary culture of p. acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1) and l. acidophilus (laca 4), and by co-culture of  p. acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1), l. acidophilus (laca 4) and s. cerevisiae (ufla yffbm 18.03) (9.03 and 8.51 g/l, respectively). the final content of ethanol was 0.03% (v/v) or less, which classified the final beverage as non-alcoholic.

TI  == probiotic assessment of enterococcus durans 6hl and lactococcus lactis 2hl isolated from vaginal microflora.
AB  == forty-five lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from the vaginal specimens of healthy fertile women, and the identities of the bacteria were confirmed by sequencing of their 16s rdna genes. among these bacteria, only four isolates were able to resist and survive in low ph, bile salts and simulated in vitro digestion conditions. lactococcus lactis 2hl, enterococcus durans 6hl, lactobacillus acidophilus 36yl and lactobacillus plantarum 5bl showed the best resistance to these conditions. these strains were evaluated further to assess their ability to adhere to human intestinal caco-2 cells. lactococcus lactis 2hl and e. durans 6hl were the most adherent strains. in vitro tests under neutralized ph proved the antimicrobial activity of both strains. results revealed that the growth of escherichia coli o26, staphylococcus aureus and shigella flexneri was suppressed  by both lab strains. the antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that these strains were sensitive to all nine antibiotics: vancomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol. these data suggest that e. durans 6hl and lactococcus lactis 2hl could be examined further for their useful properties and could be developed  as new probiotics.

TI  == dahi containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum improves phagocytic potential of macrophages in aged mice.
AB  == the present study investigated the effect of dahi containing potential probiotic  bacterial strains on macrophage functions in ageing mice. probiotic dahi was prepared by co-culturing dahi bacteria (lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis biovar diacetylactis) along with lactobacillus acidophilus lavk2 (la-dahi) or combined l. acidophilus lavk2 and bifidobacterium  bifidum bbvk3 (labb-dahi) in buffalo milk. the effect of ageing on phagocytic function was evaluated on 4 mo, 12 mo and 16 mo old mice. the effect of probiotic dahi was evaluated for macrophage functions in ageing mice (12 mo old) fed la-dahi or labb-dahi supplements for 4 months. the production of extracellular superoxide and h2o2 declined in peritoneal macrophages but enhanced in splenic macrophages, while intracellular superoxide declined in both peritoneal and splenic macrophages with ageing in mice. a decline in phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages was also observed in aged mice. supplementation of diet with la-dahi or labb-dahi for 4 months improved production of reactive oxygen species and phagocytic and adherence indices of peritoneal macrophages in aged mice. these results suggest that oral administration of la-dahi or labb-dahi has  potential to improve immune functions in ageing individuals.

TI  == construction of a food-grade cell surface display system for lactobacillus casei.
AB  == in this study, a food-grade cell surface display host/vector system for lactobacillus casei was constructed. the food-grade host l. casei q-5 was a lactose-deficient derivative of l. casei atcc 334 obtained by plasmid elimination. the food-grade cell surface display vector was constructed based on  safe dna elements from lactic acid bacteria containing the following: psh71 replicon from lactococcus lactis, lactose metabolism genes from l. casei atcc 334 as complementation markers, and surface layer protein gene from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 for cell surface display. the feasibility of the new host/vector system was verified by the expression of green fluorescent protein (gfp) on l. casei. laser scanning confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis using anti-gfp antibody confirmed that gfp was anchored on the surface of the recombinant cells. the stability of recombinant l. casei cells in artificial gastrointestinal conditions was verified, which is beneficial for oral vaccination applications. these results indicate that the food-grade host/vector  system can be an excellent antigen delivery vehicle in oral vaccine construction.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == improved membrane protein expression in lactococcus lactis by fusion to mistic.
AB  == difficulty overexpressing (eukaryotic) membrane proteins is generally considered  as the major impediment in their structural and functional research. lactococcus  lactis possesses many properties ideal for membrane protein expression. in order  to investigate membrane protein expression in l. lactis, we created a novel expression system by introducing mistic, a short peptide previously identified in bacillus subtilis, into l. lactis. the potential of this system was demonstrated  in the overexpression of a eukaryotic membrane protein (pkjdes4) and a prokaryotic membrane protein (pkjli), a newly isolated linoleate isomerase from lactobacillus acidophilus. the expression levels reached up to 4.4 % and 45.2 % for pkjdes4 and pkjli, respectively, which represented an exceptionally robust ability to overproduce membrane proteins. moreover, the expressed pkjli was functional, with its catalysing nature characterized for the first time in this species. up to 0.852 mg ml(-1) conjugated linoleic acid was obtained during the linoleic acid conversion catalysed by the recombinant lactococcal strains. in summary, we established a membrane protein expression system in l. lactis and examined its functionality. our results demonstrate that the mistic chaperoning strategy can be efficiently applied to l. lactis hosts and show its extraordinary capacity to facilitate the high-yield production of intractable membrane proteins.

TI  == effect of drying methods of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus and lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris on secondary protein structure and glass transition temperature as studied by fourier transform infrared and differential  scanning calorimetry.
AB  == protective mechanisms of casein-based microcapsules containing mannitol on lactobacillus acidophilus and lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, changes in their  secondary protein structures, and glass transition of the microcapsules were studied after spray- or freeze-drying and after 10 wk of storage in aluminum foil pouches containing different desiccants (naoh, licl, or silica gel) at 25 degrees c. an in situ fourier transform infrared analysis was carried out to recognize any changes in fatty acids (fa) of bacterial cell envelopes, interaction between  polar site of cell envelopes and microcapsules, and alteration of their secondary protein structures. differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine glass transition of microcapsules based on glass transition temperature (t(g)) values.  hierarchical cluster analysis based on functional groups of cell envelopes and secondary protein structures was also carried out to classify the microencapsulated bacteria due to the effects of spray- or freeze-drying and storage for 10 wk. the results showed that drying process did not affect fa and secondary protein structures of bacteria; however, those structures were affected during storage depending upon the type of desiccant used. interaction between exterior of bacterial cell envelopes and microencapsulant occurred after spray- or freeze-drying; however, these structures were maintained after storage in foil pouch containing sodium hydroxide. method of drying and type of desiccants influenced the level of similarities of microencapsulated bacteria. desiccants and method of drying affected glass transition, yet no t(g) </=25 degrees c was detected. this study demonstrated that the changes in fa and secondary structures of the microencapsulated bacteria still occurred during storage at t(g) above room temperature, indicating that the glassy state did not completely prevent chemical activities.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == influence of in ovo prebiotic and synbiotic administration on meat quality of broiler chickens.
AB  == a trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of in ovo injection of prebiotic and synbiotics on growth performance, meat quality traits (cholesterol content, intramuscular collagen properties, fiber measurements), and the presence of histopathological changes in the pectoral muscle (ps) of broiler chickens. on d 12 of incubation, 480 eggs were randomly divided into 5 experimental groups treated with different bioactives, in ovo injected: c, control with physiological saline; t1 with 1.9 mg of raffinose family oligosaccharides; t2 and t3 with 1.9 mg of raffinose family oligosaccharides enriched with different probiotic bacteria, specifically 1,000 cfu of lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis sl1 and lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris ibb sc1, respectively; t4 with commercially available synbiotic duolac, containing 500 cfu of both lactobacillus acidophilus  and streptococcus faecium with the addition of lactose (0.001 mg/embryo). among the hatched chickens, 60 males were randomly chosen (12 birds for each group) and were grown to 42 d in collective cages (n = 3 birds in each 4 cages: replications for experimental groups). broilers were fed ad libitum commercial diets according to age. in ovo prebiotic and synbiotic administration had a low effect on investigated traits, but depend on the kind of bioactives administered. commercial synbiotic treatment (t4) reduced carcass yield percentage, and the feed conversion ratio was higher in t3 and t4 groups compared with other groups.  the abdominal fat, the ultimate ph, and cholesterol of the ps were not affected by treatment. broiler chickens of the treated groups with both slightly greater ps and fiber diameter had a significantly lower amount of collagen. the greater thickness of muscle fibers (not significant) and the lower fiber density (statistically significant), observed in treated birds in comparison with those of the c group, are not associated with histopathological changes in the ps of broilers. the incidence of histopathological changes in broiler chickens from examined groups was low, which did not affect the deterioration of meat quality obtained from these birds.

TI  == antioxidant properties of potentially probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo activities.
AB  == thirty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (seven bifidobacterium, 11 lactobacillus, six lactococcus, and 10 streptococcus thermophilus) were assayed in vitro for antioxidant activity against ascorbic and linolenic acid oxidation (taa(aa) and taa(la)), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac), intracellular glutathione (tgsh), and superoxide dismutase (sod). wide dispersion of each of taa(aa), taa(la), teac, tgsh, and sod occurred within bacterial groups, indicating that antioxidative properties are strain specific. the strains bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dsmz 23032, lactobacillus acidophilus dsmz 23033, and lactobacillus brevis dsmz 23034 exhibited among the highest taa(aa), taa(la), teac, and tgsh values within the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. these  strains were used to prepare a potentially antioxidative probiotic formulation, which was administered to rats at the dose of 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) cfu/day for 18 days. the probiotic strains colonized the colon of the rats during the trial and promoted intestinal saccharolytic metabolism. the analysis of plasma antioxidant activity, reactive oxygen molecules level, and glutathione concentration, revealed that, when administered at doses of at least 10(8) cfu/day, the antioxidant mixture effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress. probiotic strains which are capable to limit excessive amounts  of reactive radicals in vivo may contribute to prevent and control several diseases associated with oxidative stress.

TI  == determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages collected from different regions of turkey by using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. in the culture-independent detection, 10 different species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analysis of the 16s rrna gene v3 region. among these species, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most dominant one in the kefir grains, while lactococcus  lactis was found to be significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. in the culture-dependent detection, the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16s rdna full-length sequencing. according to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated species were l. lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus kefiri, respectively. only 3 species, which are  l. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. this study  showed that the combination of both methods is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in kefir grains and kefir beverages. practical application: due to their artisan- and region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food products. therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable effects on the product characteristics artisan dairy products are a candidate source of such microorganisms. for this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions  of turkey were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular  methods.

TI  == spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef with added lactic  acid bacteria displayed at abusive temperatures.
AB  == growth of pathogenic organisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. can be inhibited in ground beef through the addition of certain lactic acid-producing bacteria (lab; lactobacillus acidophilus np51, lactobacillus crispatus np35, pediococcus acidilactici, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis). this study evaluated the effects of lab inclusion on the organoleptic and biochemical properties typically associated with spoilage in traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive (10 degrees c) temperatures for 36 h. trained and untrained panelist evaluations of lean color and off-odor, as well as instrumental color analyses, did not indicate an effect on spoilage traits due to lab utilization (p > 0.05). however, display length affected each variable independently and was indicative of decreased stability and acceptability as display time (h) increased (p < 0.05). thiobarbituric acid values were decreased  for ground beef with added lab (p < 0.05), but likely can be related to bacterial degradation of lipid oxidation by-products because no reduction in organoleptic traits due to oxidation was noted between treatments. overall, lab did not adversely influence the spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive temperatures for up to 36 h. furthermore, biochemical and sensory indicators of spoilage were present for all treatments at the conclusion of display. therefore, lab can be added to ground beef in traditional  packaging as a processing intervention without masking or delaying the expected spoilage characteristics.

TI  == heterologous protein display on the cell surface of lactic acid bacteria mediated by the s-layer protein.
AB  == background: previous studies have revealed that the c-terminal region of the s-layer protein from lactobacillus is responsible for the cell wall anchoring, which provide an approach for targeting heterologous proteins to the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, we developed a new surface display system in lactic acid bacteria with the c-terminal region of s-layer protein slpb of lactobacillus crispatus k2-4-3 isolated from chicken intestine. results: multiple sequence alignment revealed that the c-terminal region (lcsb) of lb. crispatus k2-4-3 slpb had a high similarity with the cell wall binding domains sa and cbsa of lactobacillus acidophilus and lb. crispatus. to evaluate the potential application as an anchoring protein, the green fluorescent protein (gfp) or beta-galactosidase (gal) was fused to the n-terminus of the lcsb region, and the fused proteins were successfully produced in escherichia coli, respectively. after mixing them with the non-genetically modified lactic acid bacteria cells, the fused gfp-lcsb and gal-lcsb were functionally associated with the cell surface of various lactic acid bacteria tested. in addition, the binding capacity could be improved by sds pretreatment. moreover, both of the fused proteins could simultaneously bind to the surface of a single cell. furthermore,  when the fused dna fragment of gfp:lcsb was inserted into the lactococcus lactis  expression vector psec:leiss:nuc, the gfp could not be secreted into the medium under the control of the nisa promoter. western blot, in-gel fluorescence assay,  immunofluorescence microscopy and sds sensitivity analysis confirmed that the gfp was successfully expressed onto the cell surface of l. lactis with the aid of the lcsb anchor. conclusion: the lcsb region can be used as a functional scaffold to  target the heterologous proteins to the cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria in  vitro and in vivo, and has also the potential for biotechnological application.

TI  == utilization of uf-permeate for production of beta-galactosidase by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == four lactobacilli strains (lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacilus casei and lactobacillus reuteri) were grown in mrs broth and three lactococci strains (streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis  and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetilactis) were grown in m17 broth. l. reuteri and s. thermophilus were chosen on the basis of the best mean beta-galactosidase activity of 10.44 and 10.01 u/ml respectively, for further studies on permeate-based medium. the maximum production of beta-galactosidase by l. reuteri was achieved at lactose concentration of 6%, initial ph 5.0-7.5, ammonium phosphate as nitrogen source at a concentration of 0.66 g n/l and incubation temperature at 30 degrees c/24 hrs to give 6.31 u/ml. while in case of s. thermophilus, maximum beta-galactosidase production was achieved at 10% lactose concentration of permeate medium, supplemented with phosphate buffer ratio of 0.5:0.5 (kh2po4:k2hpo4, g/l), at initial ph 6.0-6.5, ammonium phosphate  (0.66g n/l) as nitrogen source and incubation temperature 35 degrees c for 24 hrs to give 7.85 u/ml.

TI  == age-related decline in macrophage and lymphocyte functions in mice and its alleviation by treatment with probiotic dahi containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == this study evaluated the effects of probiotic dahi administration in ageing mice  on macrophage and lymphocyte functions. probiotic dahi were prepared by co-culturing in buffalo milk (3% fat) dahi bacteria (lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris ncdc-86 and lc. lactis ssp. lactis biovar diacetylactis ncdc-60) along with lactobacillus acidophilus lavk2 (la-dahi) or combined lb. acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum bbvk3 (labb-dahi). four groups of 12 mo old mice were fed for four months, with the supplements (5 g/day) of buffalo milk (3% fat), dahi, la-dahi and labb-dahi, respectively, in addition to basal diet, and a fifth group that received no supplements served as control. the immune functions of young mice (4 mo old) were also compared with those of ageing adult mice (16 mo old). the production of nitric oxide and cytokines il-6 and tnf-alpha declined and that of immunosuppressive prostaglandin e2 (pge2) increased by stimulated peritoneal and splenic macrophages in ageing mice, compared with their young counterparts. the proliferation of stimulated splenocytes diminished and the production of il-2 decreased and that of il-6 and tnf-alpha enhanced in ageing compared with young mice. feeding ageing mice with la-dahi or labb-dahi improved peritoneal macrophage functions stimulating nitric oxide and il-6 and diminishing pge2 production. feeding la-dahi or labb-dahi also improved lymphocyte functions stimulating their proliferation and production of il-2 in ageing mice. to conclude, the probiotic la-dahi and labb-dahi are effective in reversing age related decline in immune functions in mice.

AB  == the potential benefiting effects of probiotic dahi on age-inflicted accumulation  of oxidation products, antioxidant enzymes and expression of biomarkers of ageing were evaluated in mice. probiotic dahi were prepared by co-culturing in buffalo milk (3% fat) dahi bacteria (lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris ncdc-86 and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis biovar diacetylactis ncdc-60) along with selected  strain of lactobacillus acidophilus lavk2 (la-dahi) or combined l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum bbvk3 (labb-dahi). four groups of 12 months old mice  (6 each) were fed for 4 months supplements (5 g/day) of buffalo milk (3% fat), dahi, la-dahi and labb-dahi, respectively, with basal diet. the activities of catalase (cat) and glutathione peroxidase (gpx) declined and the contents of oxidation products, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (tbars) and protein carbonyls, increased in red blood corpuscles (rbcs), liver, kidney and heart tissues and superoxide dismutase (sod) activity increased in rbcs and hepatic tissues during ageing of mice. feeding ageing mice with la-dahi or labb-dahi increased cat activity in all the four tissues, and gpx activity in rbcs and hepatic tissue, and a significant decline in tbars in plasma, kidney and hepatic  tissues and protein carbonyls in plasma. feeding mice with probiotic dahi also reversed age related decline in expression of biomarkers of ageing, peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, senescence marker protein-30 (smp-30) and klotho in hepatic and kidney tissues. the present study suggests that probiotic dahi containing selected strains of bacteria can be used as a potential nutraceutical intervention to combat oxidative stress and molecular alterations associated with ageing.

TI  == survival of probiotic adjunct cultures in cheese and challenges in their enumeration using selective media.
AB  == various selective media for enumerating probiotic and cheese cultures were screened, with 6 media then used to study survival of probiotic bacteria in full-fat and low-fat cheddar cheese. commercial strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, or bifidobacterium lactis were added as probiotic adjuncts. the selective media, designed to promote growth of certain lactic acid bacteria (lab) over others or to differentiate between lab, were used to detect individual lab types during cheese storage. commercial strains of lactococcus, lactobacillus, and bifidobacterium spp. were initially screened on the 6 selective media along with nonstarter lab (nslab) isolates. the microbial flora of the cheeses was analyzed during 9 mo of storage  at 6 degrees c. many nslab were able to grow on media presumed selective for lactococcus, bifidobacterium spp., or lb. acidophilus, which became apparent after 90 d of cheese storage, between 90 and 120 d of storage, bacterial counts changed on media selective for bifidobacterium spp., suggesting growth of nslab.  appearance of nslab on lb. casei selective media [de man, rogosa, and sharpe (mrs)+vancomycin] occurred sooner (30 d) in low-fat cheese than in full-fat control cheeses. differentiation between nslab and lactococcus was achieved by counting after 18 to 24h when the nslab colonies were only pinpoint in size. growth of nslab on the various selective media during aging means that probiotic  adjunct cultures added during cheesemaking can only be enumerated with confidence on selective media for up to 3 or 4 mo. after this time, growth of nslab obfuscates enumeration of probiotic adjuncts. when adjunct lb. casei or lb. paracasei cultures are added during cheesemaking, they appear to remain at high numbers for a long time (9 mo) when counted on mrs+vancomycin medium, but a reasonable probability exists that they have been overtaken by nslab, which also  grow readily on this medium. enumeration using multiple selective media can provide insight into whether it is the actual adjunct culture or a nslab strain that is being enumerated.

TI  == [ph and oxidation-reduction potential change of environment during a growth of lactic acid bacteria: effects of oxidizers and reducers].
AB  == decrease of ph and dropping of oxidation-reduction potential have been observed during growing lactobacillus salivarius 1588 and 3823, lactobacillus acidophilus  101e, and lactococcus lactis 3690 in anaerobic conditions in medium with glucose  acidification. these parameters and membrane proton permeability of bacteria (c(m)(h+)) changed in the mediums with different ph. oxidizer ferrycianide and reducer dl-dithiothreitol affected the bacterial growth and their changed h+ extrusion from the cells and k+ uptake by the cells in experiment conditions. application of oxidizers and reducers are suggested for regulation of growth related with h+ ion transport in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus as a live vehicle for oral immunization against chicken anemia virus.
AB  == the acma binding domains of lactococcus lactis were used to display the vp1 protein of chicken anemia virus (cav) on lactobacillus acidophilus. one and two repeats of the cell wall binding domain of acma gene were amplified from l. lactis mg1363 genome and then inserted into co-expression vector, pbudce4.1. the  vp1 gene of cav was then fused to the acma sequences and the vp2 gene was cloned  into the second mcs of the same vector before transformation into escherichia coli. the expressed recombinant proteins were purified using a his-tag affinity column and mixed with a culture of l. acidophilus. whole cell elisa and immunofluorescence assay showed the binding of the recombinant vp1 protein on the surface of the bacterial cells. the lactobacilli cells carrying the cav vp1 protein were used to immunize specific pathogen-free chickens through the oral route. a moderate level of neutralizing antibody to cav was detected in the serum of the immunized chickens. a vp1-specific proliferative response was observed in  splenocytes of the chickens after oral immunization. the vaccinated groups also showed increased levels of th1 cytokines interleukin (il)-2, il-12, and ifn-gamma. these observations suggest that l. acidophilus can be used in the delivery of vaccines to chickens.

TI  == host range of enterococcal vana plasmids among gram-positive intestinal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the most prevalent type of acquired glycopeptide resistance is encoded by the vana transposon tn1546 located mainly on transferable plasmids in  enterococcus faecium. the limited occurrence in other species could be due to the lack of inter-species transferability and/or stability of tn1546-containing plasmids in other species. we investigated the in vitro transferability of 14 pre-characterized vana-containing plasmids hosted by e. faecium (n = 9), enterococcus faecalis (n = 4) and enterococcus raffinosus (n = 1) into several enterococcal, lactobacterial, lactococcal and bifidobacterial recipients. methods: a filter-mating protocol was harmonized using procedures of seven partner laboratories. donor strains were mated with three e. faecium recipients,  three e. faecalis recipients, a lactobacillus acidophilus recipient, a lactococcus lactis recipient and two bifidobacterium recipients. transfer rates were calculated per donor and recipient. transconjugants were confirmed by determining their phenotypic and genotypic properties. stability of plasmids in the new host was assessed in long-term growth experiments. results: in total, 282 enterococcal matings and 73 inter-genus matings were performed and evaluated. in  summary, intra-species transfer was far more frequent than inter-species transfer, if that was detectable at all. all recipients of the same species behaved similarly. inter-genus transfer was shown for broad host range control plasmids (pip501/pambeta1) only. acquired resistance plasmids remained stable in  the new host. conclusions: intra-species transfer of enterococcal vana plasmids was far more frequent than transfer across species or genus barriers and may thus explain the preferred prevalence of vana-containing plasmids among e. faecium. a  reservoir of vana plasmids in non-enterococcal intestinal colonizers does not seem to be reasonable.

TI  == anti-allergic effects of probiotic dahi through modulation of the gut immune system.
AB  == background/aims: the alarming increase in allergy in the last few decades demands the development of new anti-allergic prevention strategies, and consumption of functional foods (i.e. probiotic dahi, which has already been proven to enhance immunity by modulation of the gut mucosal immune system) may be one of them. in the present study, we evaluated anti-allergic effects of a dahi (yogurt) containing probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei and normal dahi culture  lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis (named probiotic dahi) on ovalbumin induced allergy in mice. methods: allergy was induced by injecting (i.p.) ovalbumin at 0 and 14 days. animals were fed with standard diet (control), milk,  control dahi or probiotic dahi for 21 days. total and ovalbumin-specific ige, cytokines and lymphocyte proliferation index were examined after 7, 14 and 21 days. results: feeding of probiotic dahi completely suppressed the elevation of total and ovalbumin-specific ige in the serum of ovalbumin-injected mice. similarly, splenocytes collected from mice fed with probiotic dahi entirely lost  the total and ovalbumin-specific ige production property during in-vitro culture. production of t helper (th)-1 cell-specific cytokines, i.e. interferon -gamma and interleukin (il)-2, increased, while th2-specific cytokines, i.e. il-4 and il-6,  decreased in the supernatant of cultured splenocytes collected from mice fed with probiotic dahi compared to the other groups. moreover, ovalbumin-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was strongly suppressed by feeding of probiotic dahi in  comparison to milk and control dahi. conclusions: results of the present study indicate that probiotic dahi suppressed ovalbumin-induced allergic consequences characterized by decreasing levels of total and ovalbumin-specific ige and lymphocyte proliferation and skewed ovalbumin-induced th2-specific immune response towards th1-specific response.

TI  == heterologous expression of glycoside hydrolase family 2 and 42 beta-galactosidases of lactic acid bacteria in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == this study characterized a glycoside hydrolase family 42 (gh42) beta-galactosidase of lactobacillus acidophilus (laca) and compared lactose hydrolysis, hydrolysis of onpg, pnpg and pnpg-analogues and galactooligosaccharides (goss) formation to gh2 beta-galactosidases of streptococcus thermophilus (lacz type), lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (both laclm type). beta-galactosidases were heterologously expressed in lactococcus lactis using a p170 derived promoter; experiments were performed with l. lactis crude cell extract (cce). the novel gh42 beta-galactosidase of lb. acidophilus had lower activity on lactose, onpg and pnpg but higher relative activity on pnp analogues compared to gh2 beta-galactosidases, and did not transgalactosylate at high lactose concentrations. temperature and ph optima for lactose hydrolysis varied between gh2 beta-galactosidases. onpg and pnpg were the preferred substrates for hydrolysis; in comparison, activity on pnpg-analogues was less than 1.5%. gh2 beta-galactosidases formed structurally similar gos with varying preferences. the diversity of lactic acid bacteria beta-galactosidase activity in l. lactis cce can be exploited in future nutritional or therapeutic applications.

TI  == nisin inhibits dental caries-associated microorganism in vitro.
AB  == nisin, produced by lactococcus lactis, is an antibiotic peptide to effectively antagonize a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, and is widely used as a safe food antimicrobial agent. in the present study, we investigated whether nisin could be used as an effective antibiotic peptide against the nine common cariogenic microorganisms, and its antimicrobial activity could be affected by the ingredients of saliva in oral cavity. in the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericide concentration (mbc) and spot-on-lawn assay, nisin displayed different mic, mbc and antimicrobial activity against the nine tested strains. there was statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin against the different tested bacteria (p<0.05), but no statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin dissolved in pbs and saliva (p>0.05). furthermore, morphology and membranes of streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus fermenti and lactobacillus acidophilus with nisin treatment were observed and showed different degrees of variation by a field emission scanning electron microscope (fe-sem). our findings suggested that nisin has considerable potential for prevention and treatment of dental caries.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like caco-2 cells.
AB  == invasion of the gut by pathogenic salmonella leads to production of il-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. however, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress il-8 production prevent tissue damage. we hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of il-8 synthesis. caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic bifidobacterium infantis w52, lactobacillus casei w56, lactococcus lactis w58, lactobacillus acidophilus w70, bifidobacterium bifidum w23, or lactobacillus salivarius w24 or pathogenic salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell for 1 hour. cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of salmonella as either  co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by salmonella (1 hour). the cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. il-8 and  hsp70 were determined by elisa and western blot respectively. both probiotics and salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of il-8 but probiotics induced far lower il-8 levels than salmonella. the salmonella-induced il-8 was significantly suppressed by b. infantis w52, l. casei w56 and l. lactis w58 at low numbers of salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. the observed probiotic-mediated reduction in il-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. in addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in hsp70 expression while l. acidophilus w70, b. bifidum w23 and l. salivarius w24 induced a weak hsp70 expression and could not suppress the salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis. we conclude that suppression of salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis by caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via hsp70 expression. this suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic salmonella.

TI  == comparison of expression vectors in lactobacillus reuteri strains.
AB  == the synthesis of heterologous proteins in lactobacilli is strongly influenced by  the promoter selected for the expression. in addition, the activity of the promoters themselves may vary among different bacterial hosts. three different promoters were investigated for their capability to drive enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) expression in lactococcus lactis spp. cremoris mg1363, in lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016(t) and in five l. reuteri strains isolated from chicken crops. the promoters of the lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer  protein gene (slp), l. acidophilus lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhl) and enterococcal rrna adenine n-6-methyltransferase gene (ermb) were fused to the coding sequence of egfp and inserted into the backbone of the ptrkh3 shuttle vector (ptrkh3-slpgfp, ptrkh3-ldhgfp, ptrkh3-ermgfp). besides conventional analytical methods, a new quick fluorimetric approach was set up to quantify the  egfp fluorescence in transformed clones using the qubit() fluorometer. ermb proved to be the most effective promoter in l. reuteri isolates, producing 3.90 x 10(-7) g of fluorescent egfp (ml od(stationary culture))(-1). under the same conditions, the ldhl promoter produced 2.66 x 10(-7) g of fluorescent egfp (ml od(stationary culture))(-1). even though the slp promoter was efficient in l. lactis spp. cremoris mg1363, it was nearly inactive both in l. reuteri dsm 20016(t) and in l. reuteri isolates.

AB  == bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). target dna bands were identified  according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. comigrating bands present in the dgge profiles were resolved by species-specific pcr. the results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. the dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. frequently encountered bacterial species were enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus kitasatonis, and lactobacillus kefiri. leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus,  lactobacillus buchneri, and lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. in addition, l. buchneri, l. jensenii, and l. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for  the first time in the xinjiang koumiss. furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on m17, de man-rogosa-sharpe, halligan-pearce, and kenner fecal media. the results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained  by the dgge analysis. this is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.

TI  == high-level expression of lactobacillus beta-galactosidases in lactococcus lactis  using the food-grade, nisin-controlled expression system nice.
AB  == in this work the overlapping genes (lacl and lacm) encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri , lb. acidophilus , lb. sakei , and lb. plantarum were cloned into two different nisin-controlled expression (nice) vectors and expressed using lactococcus lactis nz9000 and nz3900 as hosts. the lacl gene, encoding the large subunit of the beta-galactosidases, was fused translationally downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter nisa. chloramphenicol  was employed as selection marker for the standard system using l. lactis nz9000,  whereas lactose utilization based on the complementation of the lacf gene was used as a dominant selection marker for the food-grade system employing l. lactis nz3900. comparison of the standard and the food-grade expression system, differing only in their selection markers, gave considerable differences in volumetric beta-galactosidase activity, ranging from 1.17 to 14 ku/l of fermentation broth, depending on both the origin of the laclm genes and the selection marker used. the occurrence of codons less frequently used by l. lactis especially at the beginning of the lacl gene could be an explanation for the significant differences between the expression levels of laclm from different origins, while plasmid stability might cause the difference obtained when employing the different selection markers.

TI  == antioxidant and cholesterol assimilation activities of selected lactobacilli and  lactococci cultures.
AB  == in present study, three strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) viz. lactobacillus  casei, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactococcus lactis and milk fermented with these strains have been studied for antioxidant and cholesterol assimilation activities in-vitro and in-vivo, in addition to the effect on total lactobacilli, lactococci and coliform counts into the gut of mice fed with diets supplemented by fermented milk. all three selected strains exhibited potent 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, malonaldialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging abilities as well as inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation activity. these activities were highest in lb. casei as followed by lb. acidophilus and lc. lactis. in addition, these bacterial cultures also exhibited  good in-vitro cholesterol assimilation potential. oral administration to mice of  milk fermented with selected lab strains, slightly decreased blood cholesterol, increased colonization of total lactobacilli and lactococci, and decreased coliforms in the intestinal tissues as well as faecal samples. these results indicate that, selected lab strains have good antioxidant, hypocholesterolemic and coliform removal activities. it may suggest that, a novel functional food can be obtained by supplementation of selected lab in milk, which may have various health beneficial properties such as antioxidant and hypocholesterolemic activities.

TI  == lactococcus lactis expressing either staphylococcus aureus fibronectin-binding protein a or listeria monocytogenes internalin a can efficiently internalize and  deliver dna in human epithelial cells.
AB  == lactococci are noninvasive bacteria frequently used as protein delivery vectors and, more recently, as in vitro and in vivo dna delivery vehicles. we previously  showed that a functional eukaryotic enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) expression plasmid vector was delivered in epithelial cells by lactococcus lactis producing listeria monocytogenes internalin a (l. lactis inla(+)), but this strategy is limited in vivo to transgenic mice and guinea pigs. in this study, we compare the internalization ability of l. lactis inla(+) and l. lactis producing  either the fibronectin-binding protein a of staphylococcus aureus (l. lactis fnbpa(+)) or its fibronectin binding domains c and d (l. lactis cd(+)). l. lactis fnbpa(+) and l. lactis inla(+) showed comparable internalization rates in caco-2  cells, while the internalization rate observed with l. lactis cd(+) was lower. as visualized by conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy, large clusters of l. lactis fnbpa(+), l. lactis cd(+), and l. lactis inla(+) were present in the cytoplasm of caco-2 cells after internalization. moreover, the internalization rates of lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and of an ncfm mutant strain with the gene coding for the fibronectin-binding protein (fbpa) inactivated were also evaluated in caco-2 cells. similar low internalization rates were observed for both wild-type l. acidophilus ncfm and the fbpa mutant, suggesting that commensal fibronectin binding proteins have a role in adhesion but not in invasion. l. lactis fnbpa(+), l. lactis cd(+), and l. lactis inla(+) were then used to deliver a eukaryotic egfp expression plasmid in caco-2 cells: flow cytometry analysis showed that the highest percentage of green fluorescent caco-2 cells was observed after coculture with either l. lactis fnbpa(+) or l. lactis inla(+). analysis of  the in vivo efficiency of these invasive recombinant strains is currently in progress to validate their potential as dna vaccine delivery vehicles.

TI  == characterization of rhamnosidases from lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus  acidophilus.
AB  == lactobacilli are known to use plant materials as a food source. many such materials are rich in rhamnose-containing polyphenols, and thus it can be anticipated that lactobacilli will contain rhamnosidases. therefore, genome sequences of food-grade lactobacilli were screened for putative rhamnosidases. in the genome of lactobacillus plantarum, two putative rhamnosidase genes (ram1(lp)  and ram2(lp)) were identified, while in lactobacillus acidophilus, one rhamnosidase gene was found (rama(la)). gene products from all three genes were produced after introduction into escherichia coli and were then tested for their  enzymatic properties. ram1(lp), ram2(lp), and rama(la) were able to efficiently hydrolyze rutin and other rutinosides, while rama(la) was, in addition, able to cleave naringin, a neohesperidoside. subsequently, the potential application of lactobacillus rhamnosidases in food processing was investigated using a single matrix, tomato pulp. recombinant ram1(lp) and rama(la) enzymes were shown to remove the rhamnose from rutinosides in this material, but efficient conversion required adjustment of the tomato pulp to ph 6. the potential of ram1(lp) for fermentation of plant flavonoids was further investigated by expression in the food-grade bacterium lactococcus lactis. this system was used for fermentation of tomato pulp, with the aim of improving the bioavailability of flavonoids in processed tomato products. while import of flavonoids into l. lactis appeared to  be a limiting factor, rhamnose removal was confirmed, indicating that rhamnosidase-producing bacteria may find commercial application, depending on the technological properties of the strains and enzymes.

TI  == pretreatment but not treatment with probiotics abolishes mouse intestinal barrier dysfunction in acute pancreatitis.
AB  == background: intestinal barrier failure during acute pancreatitis (ap) is associated with translocation of luminal bacteria, resulting in infectious complications. we examined the effects of multispecies probiotics on the intestinal barrier impairment in a murine model of ap. methods: mice were injected with cerulein to induce ap and were sacrificed 11 (early ap) or 72 hours (late ap) after start of induction. ap and associated systemic effects were confirmed by histology of pancreas and lung. animals received daily probiotics starting 2 days prior to ap induction (pretreatment) or at the moment of ap induction (treatment). mucosal barrier function of the distal ileum was assessed  in ussing chambers by measurement of the epithelial electrical resistance and the permeability to na-fluorescein. results: histological analysis revealed pancreatic injury in both phases of ap, and lung damage in the early phase. epithelial resistance of the ileum was reduced and permeability increased in both phases of ap, indicating impairment of the intestinal barrier. pretreatment had no effect on resistance or permeability in the early phase of ap. in the late phase of ap, pretreatment but not treatment abolished the ap induced resistance decrease and permeability increase. administration of probiotics as such (ie, without induction of ap) had no effect on intestinal barrier function. conclusion: pretreatment with multispecies probiotics for 2 days abolishes intestinal barrier dysfunction in the late phase of ap, while treatment does not. the effectiveness of probiotics in this model depends on the timing of administration. clinical trials with probiotics should seek conditions where treatment can be started prior to onset of disease or elective surgical intervention.

AB  == the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm.  on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.

AB  == in this study, the characterization of the bacterial community present during the fermentation of pulque, a traditional mexican alcoholic beverage from maguey (agave), was determined for the first time by a polyphasic approach in which both culture and non-culture dependent methods were utilized. the work included the isolation of lactic acid bacteria (lab), aerobic mesophiles, and 16s rdna clone libraries from total dna extracted from the maguey sap (aguamiel) used as substrate, after inoculation with a sample of previously produced pulque and followed by 6-h fermentation. microbiological diversity results were correlated with fermentation process parameters such as sucrose, glucose, fructose and fermentation product concentrations. in addition, medium rheological behavior analysis and scanning electron microscopy in aguamiel and during pulque fermentation were also performed. our results showed that both culture and non-culture dependent approaches allowed the detection of several new and previously reported species within the alpha-, gamma-proteobacteria and firmicutes. bacteria diversity in aguamiel was composed by the heterofermentative leuconostoc citreum, l. mesenteroides, l. kimchi, the gamma-proteobacteria erwinia rhapontici, enterobacter spp. and acinetobacter radioresistens. inoculation with previously fermented pulque incorporated to the system microbiota, homofermentative lactobacilli related to lactobacillus acidophilus, several alpha-proteobacteria such as zymomonas mobilis and acetobacter malorum, other gamma-proteobacteria and an important amount of yeasts, creating a starting metabolic diversity composed by homofermentative and heterofermentative lab, acetic and ethanol producing microorganisms. at the end of the fermentation process, the bacterial diversity was mainly composed by the homofermentative lactobacillus acidophilus, the heterofermentative l. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and the alpha-proteobacteria a. malorum. after a 6-h fermentation, 83.27% of total sugars detected after inoculation were consumed (228.4 mm hexose equivalents) and a carbon (c) recovery of 66.18% in fermentation products was estimated. they were produced 284.4 mm c as ethanol, 71.5 mm c as acetic acid and 19 mm c as lactic acid, demonstrating the presence of homo- and heterofermentative, acetic and alcoholic metabolisms in the final product. it was also found, after hydrolysis, that the exopolysaccharide produced during the fermentation was mainly composed by fructose residues, probably inulin or levan.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum packaged beef for antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the objective of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (lab) from vacuum packaged beef and to investigate their antagonist activity. lab mean counts of 5.19 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained from five samples of vacuum packaged beef. two hundred isolates were selected and screened for the inhibitory effect on five atcc reference lactobacillus strains. thirty six isolates showed activity in the  agar spot test against at least two of the indicator strains. however, only six cell free supernatants (cfs) from these isolates exhibited activity against the indicator strains using the well-diffusion test and conditions that eliminated the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. l. acidophilus was the most sensitive indicator tested, whereas l. plantarum and l. fermentum were the most resistant ones. identification by midi system indicated that these lab isolates were lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus casei gc subgroup a. the antagonistic factors produced by most of these lab against l. acidophilus were resistant to heat treatment (100 degrees c for 10 min) and stable over a wide ph  range (4.0 to 9.0). these data suggest that these isolates could be used as promising hurdles aiming increased safety and extended shelf life of meat products.

TI  == effect of a probiotic mixed culture on texture profile and sensory performance of minas fresh cheese in comparison with the traditional products.
AB  == the effect of a mixed probiotic culture on instrumental texture, and on sensorial and related properties of minas fresh cheese during refrigerated storage was investigated. three cheese-making trials were prepared: t1, with the traditional  type o starter culture (lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis + l. lactis subsp. cremoris), t2 with only lactic acid and t3, with lactic acid and the probiotic abt culture (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 + bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 + streptococcus thermophilus). instrumental texture profile analysis and related properties were monitored during storage for up to 21 days. lb. acidophilus and b. animalis were present in high levels throughout storage of cheeses t3, above 6 log cfu.g(-1), threshold required for probiotic activity, and stimulation of the  la-5 growth was observed. cheeses with added probiotic abt culture, as well as those made adding lactic acid only, showed to be less brittle and with more favorable sensorial features, due to higher ph values. results indicated that the use of probiotic abt culture complementary to lactic acid for the purpose of substituting the type o (lc. lactis subsp. lactis + lc. lactis subsp. cremoris) culture, traditionally employed for minas cheese production, is advantageous.

TI  == design of a multispecies probiotic mixture to prevent infectious complications in critically ill patients.
AB  == background & aims: although the potential for probiotics is investigated in an increasing variety of diseases, there is little or no consensus regarding the desired probiotic properties for a particular disease in question, nor about the  final design of the probiotic. specific strain selection procedures were undertaken to design a disease-specific multispecies probiotic. methods: from a strain collection of 69 different lactic acid bacteria a primary selection was made of 14 strains belonging to different species showing superior survival in a  simulated gastrointestinal environment. functional tests like antimicrobial activity against a range of clinical isolates and cytokine inducing capacity in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to further identify potential strains. results: specific strains inhibited growth of clinical isolates whereas others superiorly induced the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10.  based on functional tests and general criteria regarding probiotic design and safety, a selection of the following six strains was made (ecologic 641); bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis. combination of these strains resulted in a wider antimicrobial spectrum, superior induction of il-10 and silencing of pro-inflammatory cytokines as compared to the individual components. conclusions: application of strict criteria during the design of a disease-specific probiotic prior to implementation in clinical trials may provide a rational basis for use of probiotics.

TI  == influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. the major species used in dairy manufacturing are lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and leuconostoc. traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. the appearance of the genomes of lactococcus lactis, bidifobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, 2  strains of streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of lab. moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different lab in  the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.

TI  == formation of oligosaccharides in skim milk fermented with mixed dahi cultures, lactococcus lactis ssp diacetylactis and probiotic strains of lactobacilli.
AB  == milk fermented with mixed dahi cultures ncdc167, lactococcus lactis ssp diacetylactis ncdc60 and two probiotic strains; lactobacillus acidophilus ncdc14  and lb. casei ncdc19 were evaluated after fermentation (14 h) and during 8 d storage at 7 degrees c. the beta-galactosidase activity was found to increase after fermentation leading to the hydrolysis of lactose and production of glucose, galactose and oligosaccharides; that subsequently decreased during storage. the viable counts of lactococci and lactobacilli decreased during storage yet remained >106 cfu/ml after storage. the results of present study indicate that all the selected cultures have ability to produce oligosaccharides  (prebiotics) due to transgalactosidal and lactose hydrolysis activities of beta-galactosidase. the cultures developed an active synbiotic formula by maintaining sufficient probiotic viable counts to exert health benefits to the consumers.

TI  == upregulation of oxidative burst and degranulation in chicken heterophils stimulated with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == the immune system of neonatal chicks is functionally immature during the first week of life. researchers have previously demonstrated that the avian humoral response can be increased with probiotics. although the humoral response provides the chick with an effective mechanism to combat pathogens, sufficient antibody titers are not attained until 7 to 10 d postinfection. however, the innate immune system (i.e., heterophils) can respond much more quickly to pathogens. the objective of this study was to determine whether probiotic bacteria can also upregulate heterophil function. heterophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of neonatal chickens by using a discontinuous density gradient. oxidative burst and degranulation are bactericidal mechanisms used by heterophils to kill pathogens and were used in this study as indicators of heterophil function. we found that each of the 10 "generally recognized as safe" probiotic isolates (designated g1 to g11) tested in vitro were capable of increasing (p < 0.05) heterophil oxidative burst and degranulation when compared with unstimulated controls. bacillus subtilis (g3), lactococcus lactis lactis (g6), and lactobacillus acidophilus (g8) isolates were determined to elicit the greatest heterophil response in vitro and were subsequently fed to chicks. phosphate-buffered saline or 1 of these 3 probiotic isolates (approximately 2.5 x 10(8) cfu/chick; 50 chicks/treatment) resuspended in pbs was administered by oral gavage on the day of hatch. heterophils were isolated from chicks from each of these 4 treatment groups 24 h posttreatment. significant increases in heterophil  degranulation and oxidative burst were observed with the g3-, g6-, and g8-treated chicks when compared with heterophils isolated from birds with no probiotic treatment. these data suggest that probiotic bacteria can significantly improve heterophil oxidative burst and degranulation in broilers. to our knowledge, this  is the first study demonstrating a relationship between probiotics and avian heterophil function.

TI  == improvement of protein production in lactic acid bacteria using 5'-untranslated leader sequence of slpa from lactobacillus acidophilus. improvement in protein production using utls.
AB  == the 5'-untranslated leader sequence (utls) of the slpa gene from lactobacillus acidophilus contributes to mrna stabilization by producing a 5' stem and loop structure, and a high-level expression system for the lactic acid bacteria was developed using the utls in this study. a plasmid, which expresses alpha-amylase  under the control of the ldh promoter, was constructed by integrating the core promoter sequence with the utls. the role of the utls in increasing the copies of the alpha-amylase mrna was proved by measuring alpha-amylase activity in the culture supernatant and the relative expression of alpha-amylase mrna was determined by the quantitative real-time pcr analysis. moreover, several expression systems were constructed by combining the core promoter sequence with  the utls or with the partially deleted utls and the expression level was evaluated. the use of the utls led to the success in improving alpha-amylase expression in the two strains of lactobacillus casei and lactococcus lactis. the  current study showed that the improvement in protein production using the utls could be applied to the expression system in the lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == two families of rep-like genes that probably originated by interspecies recombination are represented in viral, plasmid, bacterial, and parasitic protozoan genomes.
AB  == two families of genes related to, and including, rolling circle replication initiator protein (rep) genes were defined by sequence similarity and by evidence of intergene family recombination. the rep genes of circoviruses were the best characterized members of the "recrep1 family." other members of the recrep1 family were rep-like genes found in the genomes of the canarypox virus, entamoeba histolytica, and giardia duodenalis and in a plasmid, p4m, from the gram-positive bacterium, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the "recrep2 family" comprised some previously identified rep-like genes from plasmids of phytoplasmas and similar rep-like genes from the genomes of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactococcus lactis, and phytoplasma asteris. both recrep1 and recrep2 proteins have a nucleotide-binding domain significantly similar to the helicases (2c proteins) of picorna-like viruses. on the n-terminal side of the nucleotide binding domain, recrep1 proteins have a domain significantly similar to one found in nanovirus reps, whereas recrep2 proteins have a domain significantly similar to one in the  reps of pls1 plasmids. we speculate that recrep genes have been transferred from  viruses or plasmids to parasitic protozoan and bacterial genomes and that rep proteins were themselves involved in the original recombination events that generated the ancestral recrep genes.

TI  == use of unsupervised and supervised artificial neural networks for the identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins.

[piraino, p., ricciardi, a., lanorte, m. t., malkhazova, i., parente, e., 2002. a new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. biotechnol. lett. 24, 1477-1482]. hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (leuconostoc, lb. sakei/lb. curvatus, lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus, lb. plantarum/lb. paraplantarum, lc. lactis/lc. raffinolactis). a 7x7 kohonen self-organizing map (ksom), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. the map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 bayesian network  were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of sds-page patterns of  lc. lactis from those of other species. we conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins.

AB  == aims: the propionibacteria are commercially important due to their use in the cheese industry, and there is a growing interest for their probiotic effects. stimulatory effects of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on propionic acid bacteria have been observed. this study was designed to examine the possibility of using spent  media previously used to grow lab for the production of biomass and metabolites of propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. methods and results: seventeen mrs and vegetable juice media were prefermented by various lab and evaluated for their ability to subsequently support the growth of propionibacterium, using automated spectrophotometry (as). growth of propionibacterium in spent media was strongly affected by the lab strain used to  produce the spent medium. the native mrs medium (not prefermented) yielded the highest optical density values followed by prefermented media by lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum and lactococcus lactis. prefermented cabbage  juice enabled good growth of propionibacterium. for the production of organic acids and vitamin b12, cells of propionibacterium were concentrated and immobilized in alginate beads in the aim of accelerating the bioconversions. more propionic acid was obtained in spent media than in native mrs. the concentration  of vitamin b12 was higher in media fermented with free cells than those with immobilized cultures; with the free cells, its concentration varied from 900 to 1800 ng ml(-1) of media. conclusions: it was demonstrated that spent media could  be recycled for the production of propionibacterium and metabolites, depending on the lab strain that was previously grown. media remediation is needed to improve  the production of vitamin b12, especially with immobilized cells. significance and impact of the study: this study presents an option for recycling of spent media generated by producers of lab or producers of fermented vegetables. the propionic fermentation may result in three commercial products: biomass, vitamin  b12 or organic acids, which may be used as starters, supplements or food preservatives. it is an attractive process from economical and environmental standpoints.

TI  == survival of lactococci during passage through mouse digestive tract.
AB  == one of the important properties of probiotics is the ability to survive in the intestine. there have been few studies on the probiotic property of lactococci, since they are formally not considered to be natural inhabitants of the intestine. to evaluate lactococci as probiotic bacteria, we investigated their ability to survive during gastric transit by in vitro and in vivo tests. when exposed to an in vitro simulated gastrointestinal environment, such as low ph and bile, only lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bv. diacetylactis n7 showed a moderate survival rate among the four strains tested. the tested strains were orally administered to mice, and intestinal passage of the ingested strains was monitored by two methods: antibiotics and pcr. viable cells of strain n7 were recovered from feces within 24-48 h after administration but not at 72 h. lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris atcc 19257, which had a poor survival rate in  vitro test, was also detected at 12 h but not at 24 h. these results indicate that lactococci can reach the mouse intestine alive, but not colonize it. if administered daily, viable strain n7 may exist continuously in the intestine. the effect of strain n7 on intestinal microbial balance and on animal health will be  the subject of a further study.

AB  == the growth of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a ph-auxostat. the computer-controlled smooth change of ph or temperature was used to study the effect of ph and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield y(atp) and specific lactate production rate q(atp)). the behaviour of mu and q(atp) with an increase of temperature suggested that atp production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the decrease of y(atp) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while q(atp) remained constant or even increased. with the decrease of ph, decrease of both y(atp) and q(atp) was observed. s. thermophilus st20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees c was the most acid sensitive strain. the l. paracasei e1h3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to ph change. the behaviour of mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus in milk in a ph-auxostat with ph-decrease was in agreement with the  pure culture experiments of the same species. the study showed that ph-auxostat with smooth controlled change of ph and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of lab.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI  == cholesterol removal from media by lactococci.
AB  == elevated serum cholesterol in humans is generally a risk factor correlated with the development of coronary heart disease. it has been reported that a culture of lactobacillus acidophilus actively taking up cholesterol from a laboratory medium would function in vivo to exert a hypocholesterolemic effect. in the present study, seven strains of the genus lactococcus were examined for their ability to  remove cholesterol from laboratory media during growth. all strains of lactococci tested could remove cholesterol from media without degrading cholesterol. the amount of cholesterol removed was strain specific. among them, lc. lactis subsp.  lactis biovar diacetylactis n7 could remove as much cholesterol as l. acidophilus atcc 43121, which had a beneficial influence on serum cholesterol levels in pigs. the manner of cholesterol removal by strain n7 corresponded to the manner of its  growth. the growth of strain n7 (growth yield and growth efficiency) was enhanced. the fatty acid composition of the cells of strain n7 was altered by removing cholesterol from the media. the ability to remove cholesterol was also observed in the heat-killed cells of strain n7. however, the amount of cholesterol removed by the cells during growth was significantly higher than that removed by the heat-killed cells. thus, strain n7 has the ability to remove cholesterol from media independently of whether cells are viable. these results indicate that administration of strain n7 in vivo may well be promising on the hypocholesterolemic effect.

AB  == an automated spectrophotometric (as) method was used to evaluate the growth-promoting ability of yeast extracts (ye) on cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. the as data were compared to  that obtained from classical shake flask fermentations and from 250 ml bioreactors equipped with ph control. in assays involving the evaluation of 26 different commercial ye, maximum growth rate (&mgr;(max)) values determined with  the as unit ranged from 0.25 to 0.45 h(-1) for lb. acidophilus and from 0.10 to 0.40 h(-1) for lc. cremoris. good correlations were obtained between as data and  manual sampling from the shake flasks or the bioreactors for mmax, as well as maximum optical density (od(max)). the as method is thus useful as a screening tool for the selection of ye lots in media formulation. species reacted differently to the 26 ye, but less variation was observed between strains of the  same species. this suggests that a producer of various lactococci or lactobacilli can expect a relatively constant response to a given ye lot between strains of the same species. however, it should not be assumed that the ye having the best growth-promoting properties for lb. acidophilus will also be the best media supplements for the growth of lc. cremoris.

TI  == esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

TI  == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria used for fermented  dairy products.
AB  == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. for this aim, a total of 48 strains of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. the detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized  by growth kinetics. a variety of interactions was demonstrated. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit s. thermophilus strains. among  probiotic cultures, lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (lb. casei and bifidobacterium). in general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. the study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). the possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and  their survival in the products during cold storage.

AB  == the c repeat region of the m6 protein (m6c) from streptococcus pyogenes was expressed within the pip bacteriophage receptor on the surface of lactococcus lactis. m6c was also detected in the culture medium. the pip-emm6c allele was integrated into the chromosome and stably expressed without antibiotic selection. the level of cell-associated surface expression of pipm6c was 0.015% of total cellular protein. the amount of pipm6c on the cell surface was increased about 17-fold by expressing pip-emm6c from a high-copy-number plasmid. replacing the native pip promoter with stronger promoters isolated previously from lactobacillus acidophilus increased surface expression of pipm6c from the high-copy-number plasmid up to 27-fold. concomitantly, the amount of pipm6c in the medium increased 113-fold. the amount of pipm6c did not vary greatly between  exponential- and stationary-phase cultures. western blots indicated that the full-length pipm6c protein and most of the numerous proteolytic products were found only on the cell surface, whereas only one proteolytic fragment was found in the culture medium.

TI  == characterization of the lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and cheese from northwest argentina.
AB  == indigenous lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and artisanal cheese were studied in four samples of fresh raw milk and four 1-month-old cheeses from the provinces of northwest argentina. mean growth counts on m17, mrs, and mse agar media did not show significant differences (p < 0.05) in raw milk and cheeses. isolates of  lactic acid bacteria from milk were identified as enterococcus (48%), lactococci  (14%), leuconostocs (8%), and lactobacilli (30%). all lactococci were identified  as lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis and subsp. cremoris). lactobacilli were identified as lactobacillus plantarum (92%) and lactobacillus acidophilus (8%). enterococci (59%) and lactobacilli (41%) were isolated from cheeses. l. plantarum (93%), l. acidophilus (5%), and lactobacillus casei (2%) were most frequently isolated. l. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis strains were considered as fast acid producers. l. lactis subsp. cremoris strains were slow acid producers.  l. plantarum and l. casei strains identified from the cheeses showed slow acid production. the majority of the lactobacilli and lactococcus lactis strains utilized citrate and produced diacetyl and acetoin in milk. enzyme activities (api-zym tests) of lactococci were low, but activities of l. plantarum strains were considerably higher. the predominance of l. plantarum in artisanal cheese is probably important in the ripening of these cheeses due to their physiological and biochemical characteristics.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular identification and clustering of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts from wheat (species triticum durum and triticum aestivum) sourdoughs of southern italy.
AB  == the microflora of 25 wheat sourdoughs from the apulia region, southern italy, was characterized. the sourdoughs were mainly produced from triticum durum wheat. the number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts ranged from ca. log 7.5 to log 9.3 colony forming units (cfu)/g and from log 5.5 to log 8.4 cfu/g, respectively. about 38% of the 317 isolates of lactic acid bacteria were identified by conventional physiological and biochemical tests. phenotypic identification was confirmed by 16s rdna and 16s/23s rrna spacer region pcr. overall, 30% of the isolates were identified as lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, 20% as lb. alimentarius, 14% as lb. brevis, 12% as leuconostoc citreum, 7% as lb. plantarum, 6% as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 4% as lb. fermentum and lb. acidophilus,  2% as weissella confusa and 1% as lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. some of these species have not been previously isolated from sourdoughs. since bakers yeast is widely used in sourdough production, saccharomyces cerevisiae was largely found. the phenotypical relationships within the main lactic acid bacteria identified were established by using cluster analysis. a microbial map of the 25 sourdoughs was plotted showing characteristic associations among lactic acid bacteria and differences in the lactic acid bacteria species which were mainly due to the species of wheat flour, use of bakers yeast and type of bread.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

TI  == molecular analysis of mutated lactobacillus acidophilus promoter-like sequence p15.
AB  == the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis  of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to  the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in  l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.

(one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms,  yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had  a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == solvent extraction of bacteriocins from liquid cultures.
AB  == a solvent extraction method was developed to concentrate lacidin from the culture of lactobacillus acidophilus osu133. the new method concentrates the bacteriocin  at the interface between chloroform and the aqueous culture of the producing bacterium. compared with other extraction procedures, the new method effectively  recovers higher bacteriocin yield and results in relatively clean preparations. recovery of lacidin by the chloroform extraction procedure, compared with ammonium sulphate precipitation and cell acidification methods, was >10-fold and  about 100-fold greater, respectively. the new extraction procedure saves time and is easy to perform. this method is also effective in recovering subtilin, bacillicin, pediocin and nisin from cultures of bacillus subtilis atcc 6633, b. subtilis osy1115/c, pediococcus acidilactici po2 and lactococcus lactis atcc 11454, respectively.

TI  == analysis of promoter sequences from lactobacillus and lactococcus and their activity in several lactobacillus species.
AB  == promoter-active fragments were isolated from the genome of the probiotic organism lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg using the promoter-probe vector pnz272. these promoter elements, together with a promoter fragment isolated from the vaginal strain lactobacillus fermentum br11 and two previously defined promoters (lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 slpa), were introduced into three strains of lactobacillus. primer-extension analysis was used to map the transcriptional start site for each promoter. all promoter fragments tested were functional in each of the three lactobacilli and a purine residue was used to initiate transcription in most cases. the promoter elements encompassed a 52- to 1,140-fold range in promoter activity depending on the host  strain. lactobacillus promoters were further examined by surveying previously mapped sequences for conserved base positions. the lactobacillus hexamer regions  (-35: ttgaca and -10: tataat) closely resembled those of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, with the highest degree of agreement at the -10 hexamer. the tg dinucleotide upstream of the -10 hexamer was conserved in 26% of lactobacillus promoters studied, but conservation rates differed between species. the region upstream of the -35 hexamer of lactobacillus promoters showed conservation with the bacterial up element.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

AB  == vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to taqi-digested dna of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum. the minimal region of lactobacillus plasmid dna that was required for  dna replication was defined and a single-stranded dna intermediate replication system was observed. homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. it was shown that the constructed vectors, named ppsc20 and ppsc22, were transformable into l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. using plasmid ppsc22, the alpha-amylase gene of bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several lactobacillus species.

TI  == binding of mutagens by fractions of the cell wall skeleton of lactic acid bacteria on mutagens.
AB  == the binding effect of cells and cell fractions, cell wall skeleton, cytoplasm, whole cells, and cell wall skeleton treated by lysozyme and alpha-amylase at 37 degrees c for 5 h, on trp-p-1 (3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-[5h]pyrido [4,3-b]indole) and trp-p-2 (3-amino-1-methyl-[5h]-pyrido[4,3-b]indole) were investigated. the cell and cell wall skeleton of streptococcus cremoris z-25 had greater binding activity, but cytoplasm and extract of cell wall skeleton did not bind trp-p-1 and trp-p-2. when the cells or cell wall skeleton were treated with lysozyme and  alpha-amylase, unbound trp-p-1 and trp-p-2 concentrations were greater than that  of the untreated control. it is possible that cell walls may be involved in the binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates to lactic acid bacteria. the cell wall skeleton  of s. cremoris z-25, lactobacillus acidophilus ifo 13951, and bifidobacterium bifidum ifo 14252 showed binding of trp-p-1, 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'- d)imidazole, 2-amino-5-phenylpyridine, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline, 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo(4,5-f) quinoline, and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoxaline. the cell wall skeleton of s. cremoris group and streptococcus lactis also showed the binding activity with a n-nitrosodimethylamine. the binding of trp-p-1 to cell walls was  very high, and the binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates was variable with different bacterial species. the peptidoglycan complex and polysaccharides liberated from cell wall skeleton of s. cremoris z-25 showed strong binding of trp-p-2. peptidoglycans has a binding effect of about 19.86 micrograms/mg; polysaccharides had a binding effect of 14 micrograms/mg.

TI  == ecology of accelerated natural lactic fermentation of sorghum-based infant food formulas.
AB  == accelerated natural lactic fermentation of mixed sorghum-cowpea (formula 1) and sorghum-milkpowder (formula 2) infant food formulas was achieved by repetitive (60 fermentation cycles of 24 h each) use of the previous batch as an inoculum at a rate of 10% (w/w) and resulted in a gradual establishment of mixed populations  of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. in formula 1, early fermentation stages (fermentation cycles 1-4) were dominated by leuconostoc and lactococcus spp. which caused conditions inhibitive to yeasts. probably due to micronutrient deficiencies, the former lactic acid bacteria were succeeded by a combination of  lactobacillus plantarum and candida spp. achieving ph values 4.2-4.3. in formula  2, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus brevis consistently achieved ph 3.7-3.8, thereby allowing only a minority of yeasts, mainly candida and trichosporon spp. none of the isolated yeasts exhibited 'killer'-activity.

TI  == genetic transfer systems for delivery of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid to lactobacillus acidophilus adh: conjugation, electroporation, and transduction.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus adh is a bacteriocin-producing human isolate that adheres to human fetal intestinal cells and human ileal cells. we have employed both electroporation and conjugation methodologies to transfer various plasmids to l. acidophilus adh. furthermore, we have demonstrated transduction of plasmid  dna within this strain by a temperate bacteriophage (phi adh) harbored by l. acidophilus adh. plasmid pgk12 was introduced into strain adh by electroporation  at frequencies as high as 3.3 x 10(5) transformants/micrograms of plasmid dna. transconjugants of strain adh were recovered at frequencies of 10(-2) (pamb1), 10(-4) (pva797::tn917), and 10(-4) (pva797) per donor cell after filter-mating with lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. plasmid pgk12 was transduced from a phage phi adh lysogen into a recipient strain of l. acidophilus adh at an average frequency of 3.4 x 10(-8) transductants/pfu. transformants, transconjugants, or transductants were verified by both phenotype and plasmid profile for acquisition of plasmid dna. the ability to transfer plasmids and mobilize dna sequences by electroporation, conjugation, and transduction will augment our efforts to define and characterize the activities of l. acidophilus in the intestinal tract.

TI  == fractionation of dipeptidase activities of streptococcus lactis and dipeptidase specificity of some lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == proteins in sonic extracts of streptococcus lactis were separated by starch-gel electrophoresis at high voltage. each slab was sliced longitudinally, and half was stained for peptidases in a mixture containing a peptide, l-amino acid oxidase (snake venom), peroxidase, and o-dianisdine; the other half was stained in amido black for protein. in addition to sonic treatment, trypsin also released enzyme from acetone-treated cells. glycyl-l-phenylalanine, l-phenylalanyl-glycine, l-alanyl-l-phenylalanine, and l-phenylalanyl-l-alanine served as substrates in characterizing the enzymes. five different fractions of various specificities appeared in the gels. broad-range substrate specificities were found for sonic extracts of s. lactis, s. cremoris, s. durans, and lactobacillus acidophilus.
