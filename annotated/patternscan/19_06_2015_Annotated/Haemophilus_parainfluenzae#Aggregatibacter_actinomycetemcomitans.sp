TI  == association between hacek bacteraemia and endocarditis.
AB  == we retrospectively examined medical records of 87 patients with bacteraemia caused by members of the hacek group (haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter paraphrophilus, cardiobacterium spp., eikenella corrodens and kingella spp.) to determine whether endocarditis was present, as defined by the duke criteria. the  overall positive predictive value (ppv) of hacek bacteraemia for endocarditis was 60 %. the ppv varied with different hacek species from 0 % (e. corrodens) to 100  % (a. actinomycetemcomitans).

TI  == microbiological characterization in children with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize the subgingival microbiota of african-american children with localized aggressive periodontitis (lap). fifty-one children were included. subgingival plaque samples were taken from diseased (dd) and healthy sites (dh) in lap and from healthy sites in hs and hc and analyzed by 16s rrna-based microarrays. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) was the only species found to be both more prevalent (or = 8.3, p = 0.0025)  and abundant (p < 0.01) in dd. filifactor alocis (fa) was also found to be more prevalent in dd (or 2.31, ci 1.06-5.01, p = 0.03). most prevalent species in healthy sites were selenomonas spp, veillonella spp, streptococcus spp, bergeyella sp, and kingella oralis. overall, streptococcus spp, campylobacter gracilis, capnocytophaga granulosa, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and lautropia mirabilis were most abundant in healthy children, while aa, fa, tannerella sp, solobacterium moorei, parvimonas micra, and capnocytophaga sp were most abundant  in lap. based on a comprehensive analysis with 16s rrna-based microarrays, aa was strongly associated and site-specific in lap. in contrast, other species were found to be associated with healthy sites and individuals (clinicaltrials.gov number ct01330719). abbreviations: healthy site in healthy sibling (hs); healthy  site in healthy control child (hc).

TI  == kingella kingae endocarditis: a rare case of mitral valve perforation.
AB  == kingella kingae, a hacek (haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, kingella kingae) organism, is a common resident of the upper airway in children; it has been associated with endocarditis in children with pre-existing heart conditions. this case report describes k. kingae endocarditis  leading to valvular damage in a previously healthy 18-month-old child. our patient developed a k. kingae bacteremia that was later complicated by meningitis, septic embolic stroke, and endocarditis of the mitral valve, leading  to perforation of the posterolateral leaflet. the patient was initially treated conservatively with cefotaxime but, subsequently, required a mitral valve repair  with a pericardial patch and annuloplasty. this report draws attention to the need for clinicians to be aware of the potentially serious complications of k. kingae infection in young children. if k. kingae infection is suspected then therapy should be initiated promptly with a beta-lactam, followed by early echocardiographic assessment. this case also highlights the lack of specific guidelines available for k. kingae endocarditis.

TI  == identification of hacek clinical isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry is a rapid and accurate tool for the identification of many microorganisms. we assessed this technology for the identification of 103 haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, and kingella kingae (hacek) clinical isolates and 20 haemophilus influenzae clinical isolates. ninety-three percent of hacek organisms were identified correctly to the genus level using the bruker database, and 100% were identified to the genus level using a custom database that included clinical isolates.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == electron microscopy of phages in serotypes of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinobacillus ureae, haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus paraphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, pasteurella haemolytica and pasteurella multocida strains were examined by transmission electron microscopy for the presence of bacteriophages.  phages were detected in serotype a (suny 75) and e (uoh 1705) and in the fresh clinical isolates uoh q1243 and uoh q1247 of a. actinomycetemcomitans. phages were not found in serotype b, c and d strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, in the fresh clinical isolate uoh q1244 of this species or in old strains (including reference strains) of related species from the actinobacillus-haemophilus-pasteurella group.
