TI  == differential intestinal m-cell gene expression response to gut commensals.
AB  == different rates of bacterial translocation across the gut mucosa have been reported but few studies have examined translocation of commensals at the level of the gut epithelial microfold (m) cell. we used an in vitro m-cell model to quantify translocation and determine the transcriptional response of m cells to various commensal bacteria. the transport kinetics and gene expression profile of m cells in response to different bacterial strains, namely lactobacillus salivarius, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, was assessed. bacterial strains translocated across m cells with different efficiencies; e. coli and b. fragilis translocated with equal efficiency whereas l. salivarius translocated with less efficiency. microarray analysis of the m cell response showed both common and differential gene expression changes between the bacterial strains. in the presence of bacteria, but not control beads, up-regulated genes were mainly involved in transcription regulation whereas pro-inflammatory and stress response genes were primarily up-regulated by e. coli and b. fragilis, but not l. salivarius nor beads. translocation of bacteria and m-cell gene expression responses were confirmed in murine m cells following bacterial challenge in vivo. these results demonstrate that m cells have the ability to discriminate between different commensal bacteria and modify subsequent immune responses.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
