TI  == the contribution of genetic recombination to crispr array evolution.
AB  == crispr (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a microbial immune system against foreign dna. recognition sequences (spacers) encoded within the crispr array mediate the immune reaction in a sequence-specific manner. the known mechanisms for the evolution of crispr arrays include spacer acquisition from foreign dna elements at the time of invasion and array erosion through spacer deletion. here we consider the contribution of genetic recombination between homologous crispr arrays to the evolution of spacer repertoire. acquisition of spacers from exogenic arrays via recombination may confer the recipient with immunity against unencountered antagonists. for this purpose we develop a novel method for the detection of recombination in crispr arrays by modeling the spacer order in arrays from multiple strains from the same species.  because the evolutionary signal of spacer recombination may be similar to that of pervasive spacer deletions or independent spacer acquisition, our method entails  a robustness analysis of the recombination inference by a statistical comparison  to resampled and perturbed datasets. we analyze crispr datasets from four bacterial species: two gammaproteobacteria species harboring crispr type i and two streptococcus species harboring crispr type ii loci. we find that crispr array evolution in e. coli and s. agalactiae can be explained solely by vertical  inheritance and differential spacer deletion. in p. aeruginosa, we find an excess of single spacers potentially incorporated into the crispr locus during independent acquisition events. in s. thermophilus, evidence for spacer acquisition by recombination is present in five out of 70 strains. genetic recombination has been proposed to accelerate adaptation by combining beneficial  mutations that arose in independent lineages. however, for most species under study, we find that crispr evolution is shaped mainly by spacer acquisition and loss rather than recombination. since the evolution of spacer content is characterized by a rapid turnover, it is likely that recombination is not beneficial for improving phage resistance in the strains under study, or that it  cannot be detected in the resolution of intra-species comparisons.

TI  == crispr-based screening of genomic island excision events in bacteria.
AB  == genomic analysis of streptococcus thermophilus revealed that mobile genetic elements (mges) likely contributed to gene acquisition and loss during evolutionary adaptation to milk. clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-crispr-associated genes (crispr-cas), the adaptive immune system in bacteria, limits genetic diversity by targeting mges including bacteriophages, transposons, and plasmids. crispr-cas systems are widespread in streptococci, suggesting that the interplay between crispr-cas systems and mges is one of the driving forces governing genome homeostasis in this genus. to investigate the genetic outcomes resulting from crispr-cas targeting of integrated mges, in silico prediction revealed four genomic islands without essential genes in lengths from 8 to 102 kbp, totaling 7% of the genome. in this  study, the endogenous crispr3 type ii system was programmed to target the four islands independently through plasmid-based expression of engineered crispr arrays. targeting lacz within the largest 102-kbp genomic island was lethal to wild-type cells and resulted in a reduction of up to 2.5-log in the surviving population. genotyping of lac- survivors revealed variable deletion events between the flanking insertion-sequence elements, all resulting in elimination of the lac-encoding island. chimeric insertion sequence footprints were observed at  the deletion junctions after targeting all of the four genomic islands, suggesting a common mechanism of deletion via recombination between flanking insertion sequences. these results established that self-targeting crispr-cas systems may direct significant evolution of bacterial genomes on a population level, influencing genome homeostasis and remodeling.

TI  == mucin2 is required for probiotic agents-mediated blocking effects on meningitic e. coli-induced pathogenicities.
AB  == mucin2 (muc2), an important regulatory factor in the immune system, plays an important role in the host defense system against bacterial translocation. probiotics known to regulate muc2 gene expression has been widely studied, but the interactions among probiotic, pathogens, and mucin gene are still not fully understood. the aim of this study was to investigate the role of muc2 in blocking effects of probiotics on meningitic e. coli-induced pathogenicities. in this study, live combined probiotic tablets containing living bifidobacterium, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus were used. muc2 expression was knocked down in caco-2 cells by rnai (rna interference). 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-cdr), which enhances mucin-promoted probiotic effects through inducing production of s- adenosyl-l-methionine (same), was used  to up-regulate of muc2 expression in caco-2 cells. the adhesion to and invasion of meningitic e. coli were detected by competition assays. our studies showed that probiotic agents could block e. coli- caused intestinal colonization, bacteremia and meningitis in a neonatal sepsis and meningitis (nsm) rat model. muc2 gene expression in the neonatal rats given probiotic agents was obviously higher than that of the infected and uninfected control groups without probiotic  treatment. the prohibitive effects of probiotic agents on muc2 knockdown caco-2 cells infected with e44 were significantly reduced compared to nontransfected caco-2 cells. moreover, the results also showed that 5- aza-cdr, a drug enhancing production of same which is a protective agent of probioticswas able to significantly suppress adhesion and invasion of e44 to caco- 2 cells by up-regulation of muc2 expression. taken together, our data suggest that probiotic agents can efficiently block meningitic e. coli-induced pathogenicities in a manner dependent on muc2.

TI  == enhanced heavy metal tolerance and accumulation by transgenic sugar beets expressing streptococcus thermophilus stgcs-gs in the presence of cd, zn and cu alone or in combination.
AB  == phytoremediation is a promising means of ameliorating heavy metal pollution through the use of transgenic plants as artificial hyperaccumulators. a novel streptococcus thermophilus gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (stgcs-gs) that synthesizes glutathione (gsh) with limited feedback inhibition was overexpressed in sugar beet (beta vulgaris l.), yielding three transgenic lines (s2, s4 and s5) with enhanced tolerance to different concentrations of cadmium, zinc and copper, as indicated by their increased biomass, root length and relative growth compared with wild-type plants. transgenic sugar beets accumulated more cd, zn and cu ions in shoots than wild-type, as well as higher gsh and phytochelatin (pc) levels under different heavy metal stresses. this enhanced heavy metal tolerance and increased accumulation were likely due to the increased expression of stgcs-gs and consequent overproduction of both gsh and pc. furthermore, when multiple heavy metal ions were present at the same time, transgenic sugar beets overexpressing stgcs-gs resisted two or three of the metal combinations (50 mum cd-zn, cd-cu, zn-cu and cd-zn-cu), with greater absorption in shoots. additionally, there was no obvious competition between metals. overall, the results demonstrate the explicit role of stgcs-gs in enhancing cd, zn and cu tolerance and accumulation in transgenic sugar beet, which may represent a highly promising new tool for phytoremediation.

TI  == impact of cell-free supernatant of lactic acid bacteria on putrescine and other polyamine formation by foodborne pathogens in ornithine decarboxylase broth.
AB  == conversion of ornithine to putrescine by salmonella paratyphi a, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli was investigated in ornithine decarboxylase broth (odb) using cell-free supernatants (cfss) obtained  from leuconostoc mesenterodies subsp. cremoris, pediococcus acidilactici, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus. two groups of cell-free supernatants (25 or 50%) and control (only odb) were prepared to investigate putrescine (put) and other polyamine formation by foodborne pathogens (fbps). significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed among the species for each amine. all of the cfss reduced the formation of put by >/=65%. the production of cadaverine (cad) was scarcely affected by the presence of cfss, with the exception of the samples inoculated with l. monocytogenes. the variation in polyamine was found with respect to the control samples. spermidine (spd) was  produced in lower amount in many samples, especially in gram-negative fbps, whereas spermine (spn) increased drastically in the major part of the samples concerning the control. histamine (his) was characterized by a marked concentration decrease in all of the samples, and tyramine (tyr) was accumulated  in very low concentrations in the controls. therefore, the ability of bacteria to produce certain biogenic amines such as his, tyr, put, and cad has been studied to assess their risk and prevent their formation in food products. the results obtained from this study concluded that the lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains with non-decarboxylase activity are capable of avoiding or limiting biogenic amine formation by fbp.

TI  == streptococcus thermophilus biofilm formation: a remnant trait of ancestral commensal life?
AB  == microorganisms have a long history of use in food production and preservation. their adaptation to food environments has profoundly modified their features, mainly through genomic flux. streptococcus thermophilus, one of the most frequent starter culture organisms consumed daily by humans emerged recently from a commensal ancestor. as such, it is a useful model for genomic studies of bacterial domestication processes. many streptococcal species form biofilms, a key feature of the major lifestyle of these bacteria in nature. however, few descriptions of s. thermophilus biofilms have been reported. an analysis of the ability of a representative collection of natural isolates to form biofilms revealed that s. thermophilus was a poor biofilm producer and that this characteristic was associated with an inability to attach firmly to surfaces. the identification of three biofilm-associated genes in the strain producing the most biofilms shed light on the reasons for the rarity of this trait in this species.  these genes encode proteins involved in crucial stages of biofilm formation and are heterogeneously distributed between strains. one of the biofilm genes appears to have been acquired by horizontal transfer. the other two are located in loci presenting features of reductive evolution, and are absent from most of the strains analyzed. their orthologs in commensal bacteria are involved in adhesion  to host cells, suggesting that they are remnants of ancestral functions. the biofilm phenotype appears to be a commensal trait that has been lost during the genetic domestication of s. thermophilus, consistent with its adaptation to the milk environment and the selection of starter strains for dairy fermentations.

TI  == proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  == we examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of lb bulgaricum plc for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) grown in goat milk. the aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by lab, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (opa) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). the proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. the proteolytic activity of lactococcus lactis l598, streptococcus thermophilus t3d1, dt1, lactobacillus lactis 1043 and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. the proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella cholere enteridis, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua and enterobacter aerogenes. the most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of l. delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. the starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. the greatest antimicrobial activity  of the cultures was detected against e. aerogenes. the obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. the present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of lb bulgaricum plc.

TI  == selection and characterization of naturally occurring high acidification rate strains.
AB  == among streptococcus thermophilus cultures, the principle component of yoghurt and cheese starters, a minority of strains forms the group of 'h'-strains which show  an unusually high acidification rate, grow faster and coagulate milk 3-5 hours earlier than the typical s. thermophilus cultures. a large-scale screening study  was performed to select 'h'-strains of s. thermophilus from more than 100 samples of home-made yoghurt, industrial yoghurt starters and single cultures, maintained in the lbb culture collection. only four strains - lbb.tn1, lbb.m23, lbb.m34 and  lbb.m60 - were isolated/selected due to their ability to form large yellowish colonies on milk agar, supplemented with beta-glycerophosphate and bromocresol purple. while in general s. thermophilus is described as a species with limited proteolytic capacity and in contrast to all other tested s. thermophilus cultures, the four selected strains invariably gave positive amplification product with the polymerase chain reaction when primers, specific for the membrane proteinase-coding gene prts were used. the macrorestriction profiles of  the genomic dna of the four strains confirmed that they are non-isogenic and not  related to each other. when grown in milk and compared to the control industrial  strain lbb.a, the four strains showed a dramatically faster acidification, coagulating milk within four hours. the application of strain tn1 or m23 as adjunct culture to industrial yoghurt starter lbb.by5-12 resulted in shortening the fermentation time with more than 30 min.

TI  == fermented infant formula increases ileal protein digestibility and reduces ileal  proteolytic activity compared with standard and hydrolyzed infant formula in piglets.
AB  == background: an infant formula that contained milk fermented by the bacteria bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus (lactofidus) was reported to alleviate functional digestive symptoms in infants. it was hypothesized that improved protein digestibility of the fermented infant formula could contribute to this effect. objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the protein digestibility of a specific fermented (ff), standard (sf), and an extensively hydrolyzed protein (hf) formula. methods: four-week-old piglets (n = 7) were fitted with a t-cannula at the terminal ileum and received each formula in a latin square design. ff, sf, and hf contained 11.7%, 9.3%, and 11.9% (w/w) crude  protein; 1.5%, 5.4%, and 5.6% (w/w) fiber; and had a casein/whey ratio of 60:40,  50:50, and 0:100 per kilogram of powder, respectively. ileal digesta were collected and analyzed for amino acids and proteolytic activity. results: ff had  a significantly higher apparent ileal crude protein digestibility (92.1% +/- 1.0%) than sf and hf (84.4% +/- 1.0% and 83.9% +/- 0.9%, respectively). ff also had a significantly higher dry matter digestibility than sf and hf. the ileal crude protein flow of ff was significantly lower than that of sf and hf. the ileal flow of ff of total proteolytic activity was significantly lower than that  of sf but not significantly different from that of hf (412 +/- 163 ku/8 h vs. 1530 +/- 163 and 703 +/- 156 ku/8 h, respectively). conclusions: the ff in piglets had a significantly higher apparent ileal crude protein digestibility than the sf and the hf and displayed lower ileal proteolytic activity than sf. both effects may contribute to the alleviation of functional gastrointestinal symptoms reported in infants fed fermented infant milk formula.

TI  == study on streptococcus thermophilus isolated from qula and associated characteristic of acetaldehyde and diacetyl in their fermented milk.
AB  == in this study, the lactic acid bacterial population of qula cheese from the gansu and sichuan provinces of china were isolated and identified. eight strains of streptococcus thermophilus were isolated, of which five strains were selected for further characterization based on their fermentation properties. the changes in a number of parameters, including titration acidity, ph, viable counts, prts protease activity and the production of acetaldehyde, diacetyl and organic acid,  were monitored during fermentation and the storage of fermented milks produced by the respective strain. all of the strains displaying acidifying capacity and all  five fermented milks maintained high viable counts of s. thermophilus from fermentation to storage. our study found that the changes in the monitored parameters were strain-specific and varied considerably among the five tested strains. fermented milks produced by strain imau80809 had the highest concentration of acetaldehyde and were most favorable in the sensory evaluation.  this study confirms that qula cheese is a good source for isolating novel lactic  acid bacterial strains with different fermentation properties, which will be very useful for further development and industrialization of traditionally fermented dairy products.

TI  == cas3 nuclease-helicase activity assays.
AB  == cas3 is a signature protein of the type i crispr-cas systems and typically contains hd phosphohydrolase and superfamily 2 (sf2) helicase domains. in the type i crispr-cas systems cas3 functions as a slicer that provides foreign dna degradation. biochemical analysis indicate that cas3 of the streptococcus thermophilus dgcc7710 (st-cas3) crispr4 system is a single-stranded dna nuclease  which also possesses a single-stranded dna-stimulated atpase activity, which is coupled to unwinding of dna/dna and rna/dna duplexes in 3' to 5' direction. the interplay between the nuclease and atpase/helicase activities of st-cas3 results  in dna degradation. here, we describe assays for monitoring of st-cas3 nuclease,  atpase and helicase activities in a stand-alone form and in the presence of the cascade ribonucleoprotein complex. these assays can be easily adapted for biochemical analysis of cas3 proteins from different microorganisms.

TI  == procedures for generating crispr mutants with novel spacers acquired from viruses or plasmids.
AB  == crispr-cas systems provide immunity in bacteria and archaea against nucleic acids in the form of viral genomes and plasmids, and influence their coevolution. the first main step of crispr-cas activity is the immune adaptation through spacer(s) acquisition into an active crispr locus. this step is also mandatory for the final stage of crispr-cas activity, namely interference. this chapter describes general procedures for studying the crispr adaptation step, accomplished by producing bacteriophage-insensitive mutants (bims) or plasmid-interfering mutants (pims) using various spacer acquisition analyses and experiments. since each bacterial or archaeal species (and even strain) needs specific conditions to optimize the acquisition process, the protocols described below should be thought of as general guidelines and may not be applicable universally, without modification.because streptococcus thermophilus was used as the model system in the first published study on novel spacer acquisition and in many studies ever since, the protocols in this chapter describe specific conditions, media, and buffers that have been used with this microorganism. details for other species will be given when possible, but readers should first evaluate the best growth and storage conditions for each bacterium-foreign element pair (named the procedure settings) and bear in mind the specificity and variability of crispr-cas types and subtypes. also, we suggest to be mindful of the fact that some crispr-cas systems are not "naturally" active in terms of the ability to acquire novel crispr spacers, and that some systems may require specific conditions to induce the crispr-cas activity for spacer acquisition.

TI  == crispr immunity drives rapid phage genome evolution in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == many bacteria rely on crispr-cas systems to provide adaptive immunity against phages, predation by which can shape the ecology and functioning of microbial communities. to characterize the impact of crispr immunization on phage genome evolution, we performed long-term bacterium-phage (streptococcus thermophilus-phage 2972) coevolution experiments. we found that in this species,  crispr immunity drives fixation of single nucleotide polymorphisms that accumulate exclusively in phage genome regions targeted by crispr. mutation rates in phage genomes highly exceed those of the host. the presence of multiple phages increased phage persistence by enabling recombination-based formation of chimeric phage genomes in which sequences heavily targeted by crispr were replaced. collectively, our results establish crispr-cas adaptive immunity as a key driver  of phage genome evolution under the conditions studied and highlight the importance of multiple coexisting phages for persistence in natural systems. importance: phages remain an enigmatic part of the biosphere. as predators, they  challenge the survival of host bacteria and archaea and set off an "arms race" involving host immunization countered by phage mutation. the crispr-cas system is adaptive: by capturing fragments of a phage genome upon exposure, the host is positioned to counteract future infections. to investigate this process, we initiated massive deep-sequencing experiments with a host and infective phage and tracked the coevolution of both populations over hundreds of days. in the present study, we found that crispr immunity drives the accumulation of phage genome rearrangements (which enable longer phage survival) and escape mutations, establishing crispr as one of the fundamental drivers of phage evolution.

TI  == standardization of the method for utilization of paneer whey in cultured buttermilk.
AB  == whey is a liquid by-product obtained during manufacture of coagulated milk products like paneer, cheese etc. its disposal as waste leads to heavy load in dairy effluent and loss of valuable milk solids. for efficient and economic utilization of whey, a method was standardized for the preparation of cultured butter milk using paneer whey as one of the ingredient. it involved fermentation  of paneer whey and double toned milk separately using starter culture containing  streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. the paneeer whey can be successfully incorporated up to 50 % by following the standardized method. the proximate chemical composition of cultured buttermilk was 8.31 % total solids, 2.26 % protein, 1.12 % fat, 4.42 % lactose and 0.56 % ash. the cultured buttermilk has acceptable sensory qualities and shelf life of 5 days under refrigerated condition.

TI  == lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 suppresses fatty acid release through enlargement of fat emulsion size in vitro and promotes fecal fat excretion in healthy japanese subjects.
AB  == background: lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 (lg2055) has been shown to prevent abdominal adiposity, and suppression of lipid absorption is considered a possible mechanism, detail of which, however, are poorly understood. in the present study, we evaluated the effects of lg2055 on fat hydrolysis by determining pancreatic lipase activity and fat emulsion properties in vitro. we also examined whether lg2055 influences fecal fat excretion in humans. methods: pancreatic lipase activity was investigated in vitro using an artificially prepared fat emulsion and 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate (4-muo) as substrates. the concentrations of free fatty acids and 4-methylumbelliferone were quantified. fat emulsion droplet size  was measured using a particle size analyzer. the clinical study was performed as  a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. subjects consumed 100 g of  fermented milk (fm)/d, either with or without lg2055 supplementation, for seven days. fecal samples were collected during three-day pre-observational and fm intake periods and fecal fat levels were determined. results: lg2055 dose-dependently suppressed lipase activity in the fat emulsion assay but not in  the 4-muo assay. lg2055 dose-dependently increased fat emulsion droplet size. the effects of lg2055 on lipase activity and fat emulsion properties were increased compared with four other tested strains (lactobacillus gasseri sbt0317, lactobacillus gasseri jcm1131t, lactobacillus. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus jcm1002t and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258t). in our clinical study, fecal fat level after fm intake was significantly increased compared with that observed before fm intake in the lg2055-containing active fm group but not the control fm  group lacking lg2055. conclusions: lg2055 increased fat emulsion droplet size, resulting in the suppression of lipase-mediated fat hydrolysis. the influence of  lg2055 on the physicochemical properties of fat emulsion provides a mechanism for the probiotic-mediated suppression of lipid absorption and promotion of fecal fat excretion in humans. trial registration: umin000015772.

TI  == a combination of probiotics and whey proteins enhances anti-obesity effects of calcium and dairy products during nutritional energy restriction in ap2-agouti transgenic mice.
AB  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus paracasei tmc0409, streptococcus thermophilus tmc1543 and whey proteins were used to prepare fermented milk. for the experiment ap2- agouti transgenic mice were pre-treated with a high-sucrose/high-fat diet for 6 weeks to induce obesity. the obese mice were fed a diet containing 1.2 % ca and either non-fat dried milk (nfdm) or probiotic-fermented milk (pfm) with nutritional energy restriction for 6 weeks. the animals were examined after the treatment for changes in body weight, fat pad weight, fatty acid synthase (fas) activity, lypolysis, the expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity in adipocytes and skeletal muscle and the presence of biomarkers for oxidative and inflammatory stress in plasma. it was found that the pfm diet significantly reduced body weight, fat accumulation, and adipocyte fas activity, and increased adipocyte lipolysis as compared with the effects of the nfdm diet (p< 0.05). the adipose tissue gene expression of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11beta-hsd1) was significantly suppressed in mice that were fed pfm as compared with those that were fed nfdm (p< 0.05). pfm caused a greater up-regulation of skeletal muscle pparalpha, ppardelta, uncoupling protein 3 (ucp3) and glut4 expression and a significant decrease in the plasma concentration of insulin, malondialdehyde, tnf-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and c-reactive protein as compared with the effects of nfdm (p< 0.05). fermentation of milk with selected probiotics and  supplementation of milk with whey proteins may thus enhance anti-obesity effects  of ca and dairy products by the suppression of adipose tissue lipogenesis, activation of fat oxidation in skeletal muscle and reduction of oxidative and inflammatory stress.

TI  == bacteria and yeast microbiota in milk kefir grains from different italian regions.
AB  == kefir grains are a unique symbiotic association of different microrganisms, mainly lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and occasionally acetic acid bacteria, cohabiting in a natural polysaccharide and a protein matrix. the microbial composition of kefir grains can be considered as extremely variable since it is strongly influenced by the geographical origin of the grains and by the sub-culturing method used. the aim of this study was to elucidate the bacteria and yeast species occurring in milk kefir grains collected in some italian regions by combining the results of scanning electron microscopy analysis, viable counts on selective culture media, pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing. the main bacterial species found was lactobacillus kefiranofaciens while dekkera anomala was the predominant yeast. the presence of sub-dominant species ascribed to streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis and acetobacter genera was also highlighted. in addition, lc. lactis, enterococcus sp., bacillus sp., acetobacter fabarum, acetobacter lovaniensis and acetobacter orientalis were identified as part of the cultivable community. this work further confirms both the importance  of combining culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches to study microbial diversity in food and how the combination of multiple 16s rrna gene targets strengthens taxonomic identification using sequence-based identification  approaches.

AB  == objective: to improve the process for the production of milk-derived antihypertensive peptides, including a 12-residue peptide (ffvapfpecvgk) from alphas1-casein. results: a synthetic gene encoding this peptide was cloned within the pediocin operon, replacing the nucleic acid sequence encoding the mature pediocin peptide (papa) and resulting in a translational fusion between the pediocin leader peptide and the 12-residue hypotensive (c-12) peptide. the recombinant operon was subsequently cloned immediately downstream of the nisa promoter to allow for inducible gene expression within streptococcus thermophilus st128, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ml3 and lactobacillus casei c2. rt-pcr was used to confirm recombinant gene expression in complex medium; and sds-page analysis showed that the pediocin secretion machinery, encoded by papc and papd,  allowed for secretion of the recombinant peptide from both l. lactis ml3 and l. casei c2 in a chemically defined medium. conclusion: the use of a nisin as a "food-grade" inducer molecule, and generally-regarded-as-safe lab species suggests that this system could be used for the production of functional food ingredients.

AB  == objective: to assess the effects of daily consumption of a synbiotic yogurt drink on the health, growth, and quality of life of healthy children 12-48 months of age in out-of-home child care. study design: healthy children attending child care centers were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. the intervention was a yogurt drink containing streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis (bb-12) (5 x 10(9) cfu/100 ml serving), and 1 g of inulin (synbiotic group) vs a similar nonsynbiotic-containing acidified milk drink (placebo group)  once daily for 16 weeks. the end points were days of diarrhea, fever, vomiting, symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, use of antibiotics, physician visits, child care absenteeism, parental work absenteeism, and quality of life (pedsql 4.0; mapi research trust, lyon, france). results: compared with placebo (n = 73), children receiving synbiotic (n = 76) had significantly fewer days of reported fever (1.85 vs 1.95, p < .05), significant improvement in social functioning (p < .035; pre-to-end intervention), and school functioning (p < .045; pre-to-mid intervention). more days with >/=3 loose/watery stools were reported in the synbiotic group (p < .05). conclusions: daily supplementation of  children's diet with yogurt containing probiotic bacteria bb-12 and inulin significantly reduced days of fever and improved social and school functioning. the increased frequency of bowel movements may be explained by an accelerating effect of bb-12 and inulin on intestinal transit. further research on the possible benefits of synbiotics on children's health is advised. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov: nct00653705.

TI  == anoxic conditions promote species-specific mutualism between gut microbes in silico.
AB  == the human gut is inhabited by thousands of microbial species, most of which are still uncharacterized. gut microbes have adapted to each other's presence as well as to the host and engage in complex cross feeding. constraint-based modeling has been successfully applied to predicting microbe-microbe interactions, such as commensalism, mutualism, and competition. here, we apply a constraint-based approach to model pairwise interactions between 11 representative gut microbes. microbe-microbe interactions were computationally modeled in conjunction with human small intestinal enterocytes, and the microbe pairs were subjected to three diets with various levels of carbohydrate, fat, and protein in normoxic or anoxic environments. each microbe engaged in species-specific commensal, parasitic, mutualistic, or competitive interactions. for instance, streptococcus thermophilus efficiently outcompeted microbes with which it was paired, in agreement with the domination of streptococci in the small intestinal microbiota. under anoxic conditions, the probiotic organism lactobacillus plantarum displayed mutualistic behavior toward six other species, which, surprisingly, were almost entirely abolished under normoxic conditions. this finding suggests that the anoxic conditions in the large intestine drive mutualistic cross feeding, leading to the evolvement of an ecosystem more complex than that of the small intestinal  microbiota. moreover, we predict that the presence of the small intestinal enterocyte induces competition over host-derived nutrients. the presented framework can readily be expanded to a larger gut microbial community. this modeling approach will be of great value for subsequent studies aiming to predict conditions favoring desirable microbes or suppressing pathogens.

AB  == in this study, the effects of fat (0.5 %, 3.2 % and 5.0 %), inulin (0.0 and 1.0 %) and starter culture (0.0 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 % and 1.5 %) on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria were assessed. proteolytic activities of bacteria were also investigated. yogurts were prepared either using a sole yogurt commercial culture including streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus or bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la5 in addition to yogurt culture. relative degrees of proteolysis were found to be considerably higher in yogurt samples than uht milk as the control. both regular  and probiotic yogurts showed considerable ace-inhibitory activities. results showed that degree of proteolysis was not influenced by different fat contents, while was increased by high concentration of starter culture (1.5 % w/w) and reduced by inulin (1 % w/w). ace-inhibitory activities of yogurt were also negatively affected by the presence of inulin and high levels of fat (5 % w/w). moreover, yogurt containing probiotic bacteria showed higher inhibitory against ace in comparison to the yogurt prepared with non-probiotic strains.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == evaluation of a streptococcus thermophilus strain with innate anti-inflammatory properties as a vehicle for il-10 cdna delivery in an acute colitis model.
AB  == the aim of this work was to develop a streptococcus (s.) thermophilus strain with improved anti-inflammatory properties due to the incorporation of the therapeutic cdna delivery plasmid pvalac::il-10. to achieve this purpose, cells of s. thermophilus crl807, previously selected as being an important anti-inflammatory  strain, were electroporated with pvalac::il-10 plasmid. in order to confirm the functionality of the developed strain, it was co-cultured with human epithelial cells caco-2 and the production of il-10 was evaluated by elisa. bacterial suspensions of s. thermophilus crl807 containing pvalac::il-10 plasmid or of the  wild-type (wt) strain were administered in vivo using a murine model of intestinal inflammation. the animals treated with s. thermophilus crl807 pvalac::il-10 showed a lower body weight loss, microbial translocation to liver and damage scores in their intestines at macroscopical and microscopic levels. furthermore, a significant increase was observed in the concentration of il-10 in the intestinal contents of these mice compared to the rest of the experimental groups, accompanied by decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the insertion of the therapeutic pvalac::il-10 plasmid increased the intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity (synergetic effect) of s. thermophilus crl807 which could be included in novel treatment protocols for inflammatory bowel diseases.

AB  == pleurotus eryngii is one of the most favored oyster mushrooms and contains various beneficial bioactive compounds. polysaccharide extracted from p. eryngii  (peps) was added as a natural-source ingredient to milk before fermentation, and  the effects of additional peps on fermented milk were investigated in this study. the peps were extracted and added to reconstituted skim milk (12%, wt/vol) at 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125% (wt/vol) and fermented by a non-exopolysaccharide-producing strain, streptococcus thermophilus australian starter culture collection (ascc) 1303 (st 1303), or an exopolysaccharide-producing strep. thermophilus ascc 1275 (st 1275). bacterial growth, texture properties, microstructure, proteolytic capacity, and angiotensin-i-converting enzyme-inhibitory activities of fermented  milk (fm) were determined during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees c for 21d. viable counts of starter bacteria in fm with 0.5% peps added were the highest. changes in ph were consistent with changes in titratable acidities for all samples. the fm samples with added peps showed denser protein aggregates containing larger serum pores in confocal micrographs compared with those without peps at d 0 and 21during refrigerated storage. the values for spontaneous whey separation of fm with added peps were significantly higher than those of fm fermented by st 1303 or st 1275 without peps. the proteolytic activities of st 1303 of fm with added peps were higher than those of fm fermented by st 1303 without peps. the fm with added 0.125% peps had similar angiotensin-i-converting  enzyme-inhibitory activity to that fermented by st 1303 without peps; both were higher than those of other samples during refrigerated storage. firmness and gumminess values of fm with added peps were higher than those of fm fermented by  st 1303 or st 1275 without peps.

TI  == excess of threonine compared with serine promotes threonine aldolase activity in  lactococcus lactis il1403.
AB  == lactococcus lactis is an important lactic acid starter for food production as well as a cell factory for production of food grade additives, among which natural flavour production is one of the main interests of food producers. flavour production is associated with the degradation of amino acids and comprehensive studies are required to elucidate mechanisms behind these pathways. in this study using chemically defined medium, labelled substrate and steady-state cultivation, new data for the catabolism of threonine in lc. lactis  have been obtained. the biosynthesis of glycine in this organism is associated with the catabolic pathways of glucose and serine. nevertheless, if threonine concentration in the growth environment exceeds that of serine, threonine becomes the main source for glycine biosynthesis and the utilization of serine decreases. also, the conversion of threonine to glycine was initiated by a threonine aldolase and this was the principal pathway used for threonine degradation. as in streptococcus thermophilus, serine hydroxymethyltransferase in lc. lactis may possess a secondary activity as threonine aldolase. other catabolic pathways of threonine (e.g. threonine dehydrogenase and threonine dehydratase) were not detected.

AB  == the objective of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between amino acid consumption and necessary profiles of streptococcus thermophilus t1c2  to guide the design of media for high-cell-density culture. the amino acid consumption and necessary patterns of s. thermophilus t1c2 were investigated in the complete chemically defined medium. for amino acid consumption profiles throughout the growth of s. thermophilus t1c2, the most abundantly consumed amino acids were gln and arg, which accounted for 19 and 20% of total amino acids consumed, respectively. asparagine, thr, ser, ala, val, met, leu, and lys, consumptions of which ranged from 3 to 10% of total amino acids consumed, were the second most intensively consumed amino acids. for necessary amino acid patterns, the amount of cys, which counted for 11% of total amino acids needed, was significantly higher than the amounts required for other amino acids in growth of s. thermophilus t1c2. the necessary amounts of asp, asn, glu, gln, arg, ala, met, and tyr ranked second, ranging from 5 to 8% of total amino acids needed. compared with necessary amounts, the consumption of asn, thr, ser, gln, arg, ala, val, leu, lys, his, and phe exceeded the necessary amounts for growth of s. thermophilus t1c2 remarkably. consumption of gly, met, ile, trp, and pro was slightly higher than the necessary amounts. consumption of asp, glu, tyr, and cys was lower than the necessary amounts. the overall consumption of amino acids  exceeded the required amount for growth of s. thermophilus t1c2 almost 2.43 times, which implied a significant nitrogen wasting.

TI  == suicin 3908, a new lantibiotic produced by a strain of streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolated from a healthy carrier pig.
AB  == while streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to cause severe infections in pigs,  it can also be isolated from the tonsils of healthy animals that do not develop infections. we hypothesized that s. suis strains in healthy carrier pigs may have the ability to produce bacteriocins, which may contribute to preventing infections by pathogenic s. suis strains. two of ten s. suis serotype 2 strains isolated from healthy carrier pigs exhibited antibacterial activity against pathogenic s. suis isolates. the bacteriocin produced by s. suis 3908 was purified to homogeneity using a three-step procedure: ammonium sulfate precipitation, cationic exchange hplc, and reversed-phase hplc. the bacteriocin,  called suicin 3908, had a low molecular mass; was resistant to heat, ph, and protease treatments; and possessed membrane permeabilization activity. additive effects were obtained when suicin 3908 was used in combination with penicillin g  or amoxicillin. the amino acid sequence of suicin 3908 suggested that it is lantibiotic-related and made it possible to identify a bacteriocin locus in the genome of s. suis d12. the putative gene cluster involved in suicin production by s. suis 3908 was amplified by pcr, and the sequence analysis revealed the presence of nine open reading frames (orfs), including the structural gene and those required for the modification of amino acids, export, regulation, and immunity. suicin 3908, which is encoded by the suia gene, exhibited approximately 50% identity with bovicin hj50 (streptococcus bovis), thermophilin 1277 (streptococcus thermophilus), and macedovicin (streptococcus macedonicus). given  that s. suis 3908 cannot cause infections in animal models, that it is susceptible to conventional antibiotics, and that it produces a bacteriocin with  antibacterial activity against all pathogenic s. suis strains tested, it could potentially be used to prevent infections and to reduce antibiotic use by the swine industry.

TI  == biophysical analysis of the molecular interactions between polysaccharides and mucin.
AB  == mucoadhesive materials adhere persistently to mucosal surfaces. a mucoadhesive delivery system could therefore facilitate the controlled release of drugs and optimize their bioavailability in mucosal tissues. polysaccharides are the most versatile class of natural polymers for transmucosal drug delivery. we used microviscosimetry to explore the mucoadhesion of a library of polysaccharide families with diverse structural characteristics as a first step toward the rational design of mucoadhesive polysaccharide-based nanoformulations. here we show that the magnitude of deviation between the viscosity of mixed polysaccharide-mucin solutions and the corresponding individual stock solutions can indicate underlying molecular interactions. we found that nonlinear monotonic curves predicted a correlation between the magnitude of interaction and the ability of polysaccharide coils to contract in the presence of salt (i.e., chain  flexibility). charge-neutral polysaccharides such as dextran and streptococcus thermophilus exopolysaccharide did not interact with mucin. synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering (saxs) data supported the previously described structural features of mucin. furthermore, high-q scattering data (i.e., sensitive to smaller scales) revealed that when mucin is in dilute solution (presumably in an extended conformation) in the presence of low-mw alginate, its  structure resembles that observed at higher concentrations in the absence of alginate. this effect was less pronounced in the case of high-mw alginate, but the latter influenced the bulk properties of mucin-alginate mixtures (e.g., hydrodynamic radius and relative viscosity) more prominently than its low-mw counterpart.

AB  == cody is a transcriptional regulator conserved in the low-gc group of gram-positive bacteria. in this work, we demonstrated the presence in streptococcus thermophilus st2017 of a functional member of the cody family of global regulatory proteins, s. thermophilus cody (codyst). the codyst regulon was identified by transcriptome analysis; it consisted predominantly of genes involved in amino acid metabolism but also included genes involved in several other cellular processes, including carbon metabolism, nutrient transport, and stress response. it was revealed that codyst repressed the transformation of the  central metabolic pathway to amino acid metabolism and improved lactose utilization. furthermore, the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (gdha), repressed by codyst, was suggested to coordinate the interconversion between carbon metabolism and amino acid metabolism and to play an important role on the optimal growth of  s. thermophilus st2017 in milk. a conserved codyst box [aa(t/a)(a/t)ttctga(a/c)aatt] was indeed required for in vitro binding of codyst  to the target regions of dna. these results provided evidence for the function of codyst, by which this strain coordinately regulates its various metabolic pathways so as to adapt to the milk environment.

TI  == a sensitive assay for measuring aspartate-specific amino acid racemase activity.
AB  == d-aspartate (d-asp), a free d-amino acid found in mammals, plays crucial roles in the central nervous, neuroendocrine, and endocrine systems. in mammalian tissues, d-asp oxidase (ddo) is a degradative enzyme that stereospecifically acts on d-asp. asp racemase, a synthetic enzyme that produces d-asp from l-asp, has been  identified in several lower organisms; however, the biosynthetic pathway of d-asp in mammals remains to be fully clarified. the aim of this study was to establish  a simple, accurate, and sensitive enzymatic method for the determination of asp racemase activity. using recombinant streptococcus thermophilus asp racemase as a model enzyme, two enzymatic methods for the determination of asp racemase activity were optimized. in these methods, recombinant human ddo was used to degrade d-asp formed from l-asp by the asp racemase reaction to 2-oxo acid, the amounts of which were then determined using a colorimetric assay. in one method,  designated the coupling method, ddo was concomitantly included in the asp racemase reaction mixture, and the asp racemase reaction was readily coupled to the d-asp degradative reaction by ddo during the incubation. in the other method, designated the separating method, an aliquot of the asp racemase reaction mixture was mixed with ddo after the reaction to determine the amounts of d-asp produced  by asp racemase. under optimized conditions, the accuracy and sensitivity of these two methods were examined and compared, both to one another and conventional high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). the results presented here suggest that the coupling method is more accurate and sensitive than the other two methods and can be used for the determination of asp racemase activity. the coupling method may help to advance our current understanding of the biosynthetic pathway of d-asp in mammals.

TI  == sequences spanning the leader-repeat junction mediate crispr adaptation to phage  in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == crispr-cas systems are rna-based immune systems that protect prokaryotes from invaders such as phages and plasmids. in adaptation, the initial phase of the immune response, short foreign dna fragments are captured and integrated into host crispr loci to provide heritable defense against encountered foreign nucleic acids. each crispr contains a approximately 100-500 bp leader element that typically includes a transcription promoter, followed by an array of captured approximately 35 bp sequences (spacers) sandwiched between copies of an identical approximately 35 bp direct repeat sequence. new spacers are added immediately downstream of the leader. here, we have analyzed adaptation to phage infection in streptococcus thermophilus at the crispr1 locus to identify cis-acting elements essential for the process. we show that the leader and a single repeat of the crispr locus are sufficient for adaptation in this system. moreover, we identified a leader sequence element capable of stimulating adaptation at a dormant repeat. we found that sequences within 10 bp of the site of integration,  in both the leader and repeat of the crispr, are required for the process. our results indicate that information at the crispr leader-repeat junction is critical for adaptation in this type ii-a system and likely other crispr-cas systems.

AB  == background: streptococcus macedonicus is an intriguing streptococcal species whose most frequent source of isolation is fermented foods similarly to streptococcus thermophilus. however, s. macedonicus is closely related to commensal opportunistic pathogens of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex. methodology/principal findings: we analyzed the psma198 plasmid  isolated from the dairy strain streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 in order to provide novel clues about the main ecological niche of this bacterium. psma198 belongs to the narrow host range pci305/pwv02 family found primarily in lactococci and to the best of our knowledge it is the first such plasmid to be reported in streptococci. comparative analysis of the psma198 sequence revealed a high degree of similarity with plasmids isolated from lactococcus lactis strains  deriving from milk or its products. phylogenetic analysis of the psma198 rep showed that the vast majority of closely related proteins derive from lactococcal dairy isolates. additionally, cloning of the psma198 ori in l. lactis revealed a  100% stability of replication over 100 generations. both psma198 and the chromosome of s. macedonicus exhibit a high percentage of potential pseudogenes,  indicating that they have co-evolved under the same gene decay processes. we identified chromosomal regions in s. macedonicus that may have originated from psma198, also supporting a long co-existence of the two replicons. psma198 was also found in divergent biotypes of s. macedonicus and in strains isolated from dispersed geographic locations (e.g. greece and switzerland) showing that psma198's acquisition is not a recent event. conclusions/significance: here we propose that s. macedonicus acquired plasmid psma198 from l. lactis via an ancestral genetic exchange event that took place most probably in milk or dairy products. we provide important evidence that point towards the dairy origin of this species.

AB  == scamorza is a semi-hard, pasta filata cheese resembling low-moisture mozzarella cheese, with a short ripening time (<30d). scamorza has a bland flavor and, to provide diversification from similar cheeses, it was manufactured using 2 types of milk in the current study: 100% italian friesian milk (f) or 90% f and 10% jersey cow milk (mixed, m), and 2 types of starter: streptococcus thermophilus or s. thermophilus with peptidolytic lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus paracasei strains as adjuncts). the cheeses were ripened for 30d. the adjunct did not significantly affect acid production or growth of the primary starter; 2 of the species used in the adjunct (lb. paracasei and lb. helveticus) rapidly colonized the cheese and persisted until the end of ripening, whereas the counts of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria in the control cheese were  low until the end of ripening. the use of adjuncts affected ph, microbial composition (as assessed by both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods), total free amino acid content, and volatile profile (measured using an  electronic nose), whereas milk type had only a minor effect. although differences in primary proteolysis were found, they were probably indirect and related to the effects on ph and moisture. we conclude that, even with a short ripening time (30d), use of a peptidolytic adjunct may significantly affect important features  of scamorza and may be used to create a product that is measurably different from competing products.

TI  == quantitative analysis of the lactic acid and acetaldehyde produced by streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains isolated from traditional turkish yogurts using hplc.
AB  == the present study was conducted to evaluate the lactic acid- and acetaldehyde-producing abilities of lactic acid bacterial species isolated from traditionally manufactured turkish yogurts using hplc. the lactic acid bacterial  species purified from the yogurts were the 2 most widely used species in industrial yogurt production: streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus. these bacteria have the ability to ferment hexose sugars homofermentatively to generate lactic acid and some carbonyl compounds, such as acetaldehyde through pyruvate metabolism. the levels of the compounds produced during fermentation influence the texture and the flavor of the yogurt and are themselves influenced by the chemical composition of the milk, processing conditions, and the metabolic activity of the starter culture. in the study, morphological, biochemical, and molecular characteristics were employed to identify the bacteria obtained from homemade yogurts produced in different regions of turkey. a collection of 91 strep. thermophilus and 35 l. bulgaricus strains were investigated for their lactic acid- and acetaldehyde-formation capabilities in various media such as cow milk, lm17 agar, and aerobic-anaerobic  sm17 agar or de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar. the amounts of the metabolites generated by each strain in all conditions were quantified by hplc. the levels were found to vary depending on the species, the strain, and the growth conditions used. whereas lactic acid production ranged between 0 and 77.9 mg/kg for strep. thermophilus strains, it ranged from 0 to 103.5 mg/kg for l. bulgaricus. correspondingly, the ability to generate acetaldehyde ranged from 0 to 105.9 mg/kg in strep. thermophilus and from 0 to 126.9 mg/kg in l. bulgaricus. our study constitutes the first attempt to determine characteristics of the wild  strains isolated from traditional turkish yogurts, and the approach presented here, which reveals the differences in metabolite production abilities of the wild lactic acid bacteria strains, holds the potential for the selection of the most desirable strains to be used as starters in commercial yogurt manufacture in the future.

TI  == effect of in situ exopolysaccharide production on physicochemical, rheological, sensory, and microstructural properties of the yogurt drink ayran: an optimization study based on fermentation kinetics.
AB  == exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing starter cultures are preferred for the manufacture of fermented milk products to improve rheological and technological properties. however, no clear correlation exists between eps production and the rheological and technological properties of fermented milk products such as the yogurt drink ayran. in this study, 4 different strain conditions (eps- and eps+ streptococcus thermophilus strains) were tested as a function of incubation temperature (32, 37, or 42 degrees c) and time (2, 3, or 4 h) to determine the effect of culture type and in situ eps production on physicochemical, rheological, sensory, and microstructural properties of ayran. furthermore, we assessed the effect of fermentation conditions on amounts of eps production by different eps-producing strains during ayran production. a multifactorial design  of response surface methodology was used to model linear, interaction, and quadratic effects of these variables on steady shear rheological properties of ayran samples and in situ eps production levels. the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of ayran samples altered depending on incubation  conditions and strain selection. steady shear tests showed that ayran samples inoculated with eps+ strains exhibited pseudoplastic flow behavior. production of ayran with eps- strain (control sample) resulted in the lowest apparent viscosity values (eta50), whereas those produced with the combination of 2 eps+ strains yielded ayran with notably increased eta50 values. we concluded that incubation time was the variable with the greatest effect on eta50, consistency coefficient  (k), and flow behavior index (n) values. in situ eps production was also affected by these conditions during ayran fermentation in which strain-specific metabolism conditions were found to be the most important factor for eps production. in addition, these findings correlated the amount of in situ eps produced with the rheological properties of ayran. scanning electron microscopy images of the samples showed differences in structural features, revealing a prominent network  strand structure in the ayran samples inoculated with the admixture of 2 eps-producing strains incubated at 37 degrees c for 3 h. these results provide useful information for large-scale production of ayran by the dairy industry.

TI  == effect of a multispecies probiotic on inflammatory markers in critically ill patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background: impairment of intestinal barrier function and increased translocation of bacteria to the systemic blood flow contribute to the emergence of sepsis. probiotics might be of beneficial effects on critically ill-patients, modulating  intestinal barrier function and reducing inflammation. the aim of this trial was  to determine the effect of probiotics on inflammatory markers in critically ill-patients in intensive care unit (icu). materials and methods: this trial was  conducted on 40 critically ill-patients admitted to the icu. patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or probiotic containing lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and streptococcus thermophilus (vsl#3) for 7 days. acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache ii) score sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) and systemic concentrations of interleukin-6 (il-6), procalcitonin (pct) and protein c were measured before initiation of the study and on days 4 and 7. results: a significant difference in il-6 (p = 0.003), pct (p = 0.014) and protein c (p < 0.001) levels, and also apache ii and sofa scores  (p < 0.001) was seen over the treatment period between two groups. moreover, there was a significant decrease in serum il-6 levels (from 211.85 +/- 112.76 to  71.80 +/- 28.41) (p < 0.001) and pct levels (from 1.67 +/- 1.27 to 0.47 +/- 0.41) (p < 0.001) and a significant increase in serum protein c levels (from 7.47 +/- 3.61 to 12.87 +/- 3.63) (p < 0.001) in probiotic group during the study. conclusion: probiotics could reduce inflammation in critically ill-patients and might be considered as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of critically ill-patients.

TI  == construction and validation of a mcherry protein vector for promoter analysis in  lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == lactobacilli are widespread in natural environments and are increasingly being investigated as potential health modulators. in this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pnz8048 to express the mcherry protein (prcr) to expand the usage of the mcherry protein for analysis of gene expression in lactobacillus. this vector is also able to replicate in streptococcus pneumoniae  and escherichia coli. the usage of prcr as a promoter probe was validated in lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin b expression. the results show that the regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level, with lbab gene expression being specifically induced by co-culture of the l. acidophilus bacteriocin producer and the s. thermophilus sty-31 inducer bacterium.

AB  == the function of cell-free solutions (cfss) of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (fbps) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (tdb) using hplc. cell free solutions were prepared from four lab strains. two different concentrations  which were 50% (5 ml cfs+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml cfs+7.5 ml medium/1:3)  cfs and the control without cfs were prepared. both concentration of cfs of streptococcus thermophilus and 50% cfs of pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by salmonella paratyphi a. tyramine production by escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% cfs of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% cfs of leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. the inhibitor effect of 50% cfs of p. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by listeria monocytogenes, following lc. lactis subsp. lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% cfs of leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). the stimulation effects of 50% cfs of s. thermophilus and lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. cfs of lab strains showed  statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased ph quickly and reduced the formation of amn and bas. consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use cfs for food and food products.

TI  == effect of adjuncts on sensory properties and consumer liking of scamorza cheese.
AB  == the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a peptidolytic adjunct (lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus paracasei), as a tool to accelerate ripening, on sensory properties and acceptability of scamorza  cheese obtained using 2 types of milk (friesian and friesian+jersey) and streptococcus thermophilus as primary starter. a 10-member panel was trained using a specific frame of references and used a specific vocabulary to assess cheese sensory properties through quantitative descriptive analysis (qda), whereas 87 consumers were used to evaluate product acceptability. analysis of variance showed that milk type did not markedly alter cheese sensory properties.  conversely, panelists perceived higher intensities of butter, saltiness, and sweetness flavors in cheese without adjunct culture (st), whereas the addition of the adjunct culture (st+a) induced higher and sourness flavors, oiliness and grainy textures, and lower adhesiveness, moisture, springiness, and tenderness. principal component analysis showed positive relationships between ph and tenderness, sweetness and saltiness and a negative correlation between ph and grainy, oiliness, color and structure uniformity, sourness, and milk. most of the differences observed in qda and most of the relationships observed in the principal component analysis were linked to the higher microbial activity induced by the adjunct culture. independently of milk and starter types, consumers perceived scamorza cheese as characterized by a good eating quality (mean liking  scores were all above the neutral point of the hedonic scale). although st cheeses showed higher values for overall liking, 2 homogeneous groups of consumers were identified using partial least squares regression analysis. one group preferred st cheeses with higher levels of tenderness, adhesiveness, springiness, and moisture in terms of texture, butter in terms of flavor, and sweetness in terms of taste, whereas a second group preferred st+a products characterized by specific attributes of texture (cohesiveness and oiliness), flavor (milk), taste (sourness), and appearance (structure and color uniformity). we conclude that further studies for the development of short-ripened products based on the use of adjunct cultures should be conducted to promote product differentiation and meet the sensory requirements of particular segments of consumers.

TI  == the probiotic vsl#3 has anti-inflammatory effects and could reduce endoscopic recurrence after surgery for crohn's disease.
AB  == background & aims: probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not  been effective in preventing the recurrence of crohn's disease after surgery. we  investigated the ability of vsl#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic species, to prevent crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. methods: within 30 days of ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with crohn's disease were randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of vsl#3 (900 billion viable bacteria, comprising 4 strains of lactobacillus, 3 strains of bifidobacterium, and 1 strain of streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo (n = 60). colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine analysis. patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence  at day 90 received vsl#3 until day 365. the primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. results: at day 90, the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ significantly between vsl#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, p = .19). the proportions  of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early vsl#3 group (given vsl#3 for the entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late vsl#3 group (given vsl#3 from days 90 through 365) (p = .09). aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365) were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early vsl#3 group and  42.1% in the late vsl#3 group. patients receiving vsl#3 had reduced mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (p < .05). crohn's disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were similar in the 2 groups. conclusions: there were no statistical differences in endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received vsl#3 and patients who received placebo. lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early vsl#3 (for the entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for  prevention of crohn's disease recurrence. clinical trials.gov number: nct00175292.

TI  == programmable rna shredding by the type iii-a crispr-cas system of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == immunity against viruses and plasmids provided by crispr-cas systems relies on a  ribonucleoprotein effector complex that triggers the degradation of invasive nucleic acids (na). effector complexes of type i (cascade) and ii (cas9-dual rna) target foreign dna. intriguingly, the genetic evidence suggests that the type iii-a csm complex targets dna, whereas biochemical data show that the type iii-b  cmr complex cleaves rna. here we aimed to investigate na specificity and mechanism of crispr interference for the streptococcus thermophilus csm (iii-a) complex (stcsm). when expressed in escherichia coli, two complexes of different stoichiometry copurified with 40 and 72 nt crrna species, respectively. both complexes targeted rna and generated multiple cuts at 6 nt intervals. the csm3 protein, present in multiple copies in both csm complexes, acts as endoribonuclease. in the heterologous e. coli host, stcsm restricts ms2 rna phage in a csm3 nuclease-dependent manner. thus, our results demonstrate that the type  iii-a stcsm complex guided by crrna targets rna and not dna.

TI  == thermodynamic evidence for a dual transport mechanism in a pot peptide transporter.
AB  == peptide transport plays an important role in cellular homeostasis as a key route  for nitrogen acquisition in mammalian cells. pept1 and pept2, the mammalian proton coupled peptide transporters (pots), function to assimilate and retain diet-derived peptides and play important roles in drug pharmacokinetics. a key characteristic of the pot family is the mechanism of peptide selectivity, with members able to recognise and transport >8000 different peptides. in this study,  we present thermodynamic evidence that in the bacterial pot family transporter peptst, from streptococcus thermophilus, at least two alternative transport mechanisms operate to move peptides into the cell. whilst tri-peptides are transported with a proton:peptide stoichiometry of 3:1, di-peptides are co-transported with either 4 or 5 protons. this is the first thermodynamic study  of proton:peptide stoichiometry in the pot family and reveals that secondary active transporters can evolve different coupling mechanisms to accommodate and transport chemically and physically diverse ligands across the membrane.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactobacillus plantarum dmdl 9010, a strain with efficient nitrite degradation capacity.
AB  == nitrites commonly found in food, especially in fermented vegetables, are potential carcinogens. therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. a lactobacillus strain (lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010) was previously isolated from fermented vegetables by our group, and is not yet fully characterized. a number of phenotypical and genotypical approaches were employed to characterize lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010. its nitrite degradation capacity was compared with four other lactobacillus strains, including lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 719, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu 1.83, streptococcus thermophilus 1.204, and lactobacillus plantarum 8140, on mrs medium. compared to these four lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus  sp. dmdl 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (p<0.001).  based on 16s rdna sequencing and sequence comparison, lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 was identified as either lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus pentosus. to further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the l-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (l-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. pentosus  ig1, respectively, suggesting that lactobacillu sp. dmdl 9010 is an l. plantarum  strain. it was therefore named l. plantarum dmdl 9010. our study provides a platform for genetic engineering of l. plantarum dmdl 9010, in order to further improve its nitrite degradation capacity.

AB  == the similarity of mare's milk to breast milk makes it an interesting substrate for the creation of dairy beverages. the aim of this study was to determine the immunoreactivity of the digested mare's milk products carried out by lactic acid  fermentation with lactobacillus casei lcy, streptococcus thermophilus mk10 and bifidobacterium animalis bi30. simulation of digestion with saliva, pepsin and pancreatin/bile salts was carried out. the immunoreactivity of the milk proteins  was assessed by competitive elisa. the separation of proteins was studied using a tricine sds-page method. it has been demonstrated that lactic acid fermentation significantly decreases the immunoreactivity of beta-lactoglobulin, beta-casein,  kappa-casein and bovine serum albumin. the level of reduction was connected to the type of bacterial strain. the simulated digestion processes caused the decline of immunoreactivity, and the decreases obtained in the experiment were as follows: lactoferrin: 95%, beta-lactoglobulin: 94%, beta-casein: 93%, alpha-lactalbumin: 82%, alpha-casein: 82%, bovine serum albumin: 76% and kappa-casein: 37%. the results of the study indicated that microbial fermentation with tested strains is a valuable method for reducing the immunoreactivity of mare's milk proteins. however, further studies with other bacterial strains are needed to gain a higher level of elimination or total reduction of mare's milk immunoreactivity to possibly introduce fermented mare's milk into the diet of patients with immune-mediated digestive problems.

TI  == use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of shiga toxin-producing escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  == shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of stec and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of stec into the food chain. the initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. however, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. the aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-o157 stec strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae  genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. the probiotic mixture contained lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. the numbers of non-o157 stec in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. it was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-o157 stec in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.

AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is common in intensive care units (icus). some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of vap. several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing vap in icus. we aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of vap. objectives: to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing vap. search methods: we searched central (2014, issue 8), medline (1948 to september week 1, 2014) and embase (2010 to september 2014). selection criteria: randomised controlled trials (rcts) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding rcts that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent vap. data collection and analysis: two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. main results: we included eight rcts, with 1083 participants. all studies compared a form of probiotic (lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; lactobacillus plantarum; synbiotic 2000forte; ergyphilus; combination bifidobacterium longum +  lactobacillus bulgaricus + streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). the analysis of  all rcts showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of vap (odds ratio (or) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). however, the aggregated results were uncertain for icu mortality (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (or 0.78, 95% ci 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (or 0.72, 95% ci 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of icu stay (mean difference (md) -1.60, 95% ci -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (md -6.15, 95% ci -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (or 1.23, 95% ci 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). antibiotics for vap were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (md -3.00, 95% ci -6.04 to 0.04). however, the ci of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. there were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.the overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. the  study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.to  explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (itt) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. however, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of vap. authors' conclusions: evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of vap. however, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of vap increased the uncertainty in this finding. the available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in icu or hospital mortality with probiotic use. three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no  clear evidence of a difference. the results of this meta-analysis do not provide  sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics  for the prevention of vap in icu patients.

AB  == the salivarius group of streptococci is of particular importance for humans. this group consists of three genetically similar species, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus thermophilus. s. salivarius and s. vestibularis are commensal organisms that may occasionally cause opportunistic infections in humans, whereas s. thermophilus is a food bacterium widely used in  dairy production. we developed multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and comparative  genomic analysis to confirm the clear separation of these three species. these analyses also identified a subgroup of four strains, with a core genome diverging by about 10%, in terms of its nucleotide sequence, from that of s. salivarius sensu stricto. s. thermophilus species displays a low level of nucleotide variability, due to its recent emergence with the development of agriculture. by  contrast, nucleotide variability is high in the other two species of the salivarius group, reflecting their long-standing association with humans. the species of the salivarius group have genome sizes ranging from the smallest ( approximately 1.7mb for s. thermophilus) to the largest ( approximately 2.3mb for s. salivarius) among streptococci, reflecting genome reduction linked to a narrow, nutritionally rich environment for s. thermophilus, and natural, more competitive niches for the other two species. analyses of genomic content have indicated that the core genes of s. salivarius account for about two thirds of the genome, indicating considerable variability of gene content and differences in potential adaptive features. furthermore, we showed that the genome of this species is exceptionally rich in genes encoding surface factors, glycosyltransferases and response regulators. evidence of widespread genetic exchanges was obtained, probably involving a natural competence system and the presence of diverse mobile elements. however, although the s. salivarius strains  studied were isolated from several human body-related sites (all levels of the digestive tract, skin, breast milk, and body fluids) and included clinical strains, no genetic or genomic niche-specific features could be identified to discriminate specific group.

TI  == natamycin content and quality evaluation of yoghurt from small- and large-scale brands in turkey.
AB  == in this study, the presence of natamycin and quality parameters of yoghurt samples manufactured by small- and large-scale dairy firms in turkey were investigated. physicochemical and microbiological results revealed that, except lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus counts, the majority of the yoghurts manufactured by small-scale dairy firms were found to be out of the  limits. natamycin was detected in 31 and 2 yoghurt samples from small- and large-scale brands, respectively. the levels of natamycin in small-scale brand yoghurts were higher than those in large-scale brand yoghurts. of the analysed samples, 42.3% did not comply with the turkish food codex.

TI  == effectiveness of an association of a cranberry dry extract, d-mannose, and the two microorganisms lactobacillus plantarum lp01 and lactobacillus paracasei lpc09 in women affected by cystitis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: urinary tract infections (utis) are the most common bacterial infection in women. most utis are acute uncomplicated cystitis caused by escherichia coli (86%). this study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of  an association of a cranberry dry extract, d-mannose, a gelling complex composed  of the exopolysaccharides produced by streptococcus thermophilus st10 (dsm 25246) and tara gum, as well as the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) and lactobacillus paracasei lpc09 (dsm 24243) in women affected by acute uncomplicated cystitis. materials and methods: thirty-three premenopausal, nonpregnant women diagnosed with acute uncomplicated cystitis were enrolled in a  pilot prospective study and completed the treatment protocol. subjects were instructed to take 2 doses per day during the first month, and then to continue with 1 sachet per day until the sixtieth day. nitrites and leukocyte esterase on  urine dipstick testing were used as indicators of cystitis, with analysis performed at enrollment, after 30 and 60 days, and after 1 month of follow-up. typical uti symptoms, namely dysuria, frequent voiding of small volumes, urinary  urgency, suprapubic pain, and gross hematuria were scored 0 to 3 and evaluated at each visit. results: positive results for the presence of nitrites and leukocyte  esterase were found in 14 and 20 subjects after 30 days and in 9 and 14 women after 60 days, respectively (p<0.001). at the end of the follow-up period, positive results for nitrites and leukocyte esterase were recorded in only 4 and  3 of 24 and 19 subjects (16.7%, p=0.103; 15.8%, p=0.325, respectively), with negative results after 60 days. typical symptoms of cystitis, specifically dysuria, frequent voiding, urgency, and suprapubic pain were significantly improved as well. no significant differences were recorded in the incidence and severity of hematuria at any visit. conclusion: the long-term ability of an association of cranberry, d-mannose, an innovative gelling complex, and the 2 microorganisms tested to significantly improve the uncomfortable symptoms reported by women with acute cystitis has been suggested.

TI  == assessment of the capability of a gelling complex made of tara gum and the exopolysaccharides produced by the microorganism streptococcus thermophilus st10  to prospectively restore the gut physiological barrier: a pilot study.
AB  == background: leaky gut, or intestinal permeability, is the phenomenon of the gut wall exhibiting increased absorbency. it is pretty well recognised that an altered or damaged bowel lining or gut wall may result from unbalanced diet, parasites, infection, or medications and that this allows substances such as toxins, microbes, undigested food, or waste to leak through. as a natural consequence, this prompts the body to initiate an immune reaction leading to potentially severe health conditions. different strategies may be used to improve, at least temporarily, the physiological intestinal barrier. the use of specific beneficial microorganisms, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, has  been suggested as an innovative tool to counteract an improper level of intestinal permeability. the association of bacteria with specific gelling agents, such as gums, may represent an improvement since these molecules are able to form hydrophilic gels that distribute uniformly over the inner intestinal surface. this pilot study was undertaken to evaluate intestinal permeability in subjects treated with a gelling complex, an association of tara gum and the microorganism streptococcus thermophilus st10 (dsm 25246), which has a well-demonstrated in vitro ability to synthesise and secrete exopolysaccharides (epss). methods: twenty-five healthy subjects were enrolled in this human intervention, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial (age between 21 and 57 y, mean 37.7+/-11.2). subjects were then randomised into 2 groups: group a (13 subjects) was given an active formulation containing 250 mg of tara gum and 1 billion viable cells of s. thermophilus st10, whereas group b (12 subjects) was given a placebo formulation. all the subjects participating in the study were directed to take 1 dose per day for 30 consecutive days. the presence and concentration of exopolysaccharides (epss) in the faeces was determined at time 0 (d0), after 30 days of treatment (d30), and at the end of the 2-week follow-up period (d45). the monosaccharide composition of epss was used to quantify the possible contribution of tara gum to the amount of polysaccharides detected in the faecal material. intestinal permeability was evaluated at the same time by means of the lactitol/mannitol ratio (small intestine permeability) and sucralose concentration (colonic permeability) in urine specimens sampled after specified times. a statistical comparison was made between the concentration of epss, the lactulose/mannitol ratio, and the amount of excreted sucralose in the 2 groups at d0, d30, and d45. results: in the active group, supplementation with s. thermophilus st10 and tara gum was able to significantly increase the faecal epss concentration compared with placebo (from 0.169 mg/g to 0.633 mg/g after 30 d, p<0.001). an interesting decrease in intestinal permeability, both of the small bowel and in the colon, was also recorded. the l/m ratio diminished from 0.021 in the active group to 0.014 and 0.015 after 30 and 45 days, respectively (p=0.045 and p=0.033 compared with placebo). the sucralose concentration decreased from 35.8 mg to 27.9 mg and 29.1 mg (p=0.038 and p=0.026 compared with placebo) at the end of the supplementation period and after the follow-up, respectively. no significant differences were recorded in the placebo after 30 days or at the end  of the follow-up. conclusions: the association of the epss produced by s. thermophilus st10 and tara gum seems capable of significantly improving the intestinal functional barrier in healthy subjects. a wider study in subjects presenting impaired gut permeability would be useful in the future to confirm the positive results from this pilot trial. in any case, our findings are consistent  with the parallel increase in exopolysaccharide concentration in the faecal material, thus suggesting the effective ability of the strain used to secrete epss in the gut lumen. an innovative approach of this type may be useful in helping to restore the physiological barrier by means of a merely natural and mechanical action.

TI  == treatment of atopic dermatitis eczema with a high concentration of lactobacillus  salivarius ls01 associated with an innovative gelling complex: a pilot study on adults.
AB  == goals: to evaluate the efficacy of a highly concentrated lactobacillus salivarius preparation containing a gelling complex formed by streptococcus thermophilus st10 and tara gum in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (ad). background: previous studies have demonstrated an improvement in ad symptoms after administration of the probiotic strain l. salivarius ls01. s. thermophilus st10 and tara gum create a gelling complex that adheres to intestinal mucus and improves barrier function. study: a prospective, controlled pilot trial was carried out to evaluate how the association of s. thermophilus st10 and tara gum  could improve the activity of l. salivarius ls01 administered at high doses to adults with ad. twenty-five patients were included into the study: 13 were treated for 1 month with the active formulation, whereas 12 represented the placebo group. scoring atopic dermatitis index was determined before and at the end of probiotic administration. fecal samples were also collected to evaluate changes in bacterial counts of staphylococcus aureus and clostridia. results: a significant improvement in scorad index was observed in the probiotic group after 1 month of treatment, whereas no significant changes occurred in placebo patients. a slight decrease in fecal s. aureus count was observed in probiotic-treated patients. conclusions: data obtained in this study suggest a potential role for l. salivarius ls01 in the treatment of ad. the addition of tara gum and s. thermophilus st10 seems to improve the overall efficacy of the probiotic strain, in particular shortening the time required for the onset of the positive effects. further studies to investigate the activity of this preparation are advisable.

TI  == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the  feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms,  but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

TI  == functional screening of antibiotic resistance genes from a representative metagenomic library of food fermenting microbiota.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) represent the predominant microbiota in fermented foods. foodborne lab have received increasing attention as potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance (ar) determinants, which may be horizontally transferred to opportunistic pathogens. we have previously reported isolation of ar lab from the raw ingredients of a fermented cheese, while ar genes could be detected in the final, marketed product only by pcr amplification, thus pointing at the need for  more sensitive microbial isolation techniques. we turned therefore to construction of a metagenomic library containing microbial dna extracted directly from the food matrix. to maximize yield and purity and to ensure that genomic complexity of the library was representative of the original bacterial population, we defined a suitable protocol for total dna extraction from cheese which can also be applied to other lipid-rich foods. functional library screening on different antibiotics allowed recovery of ampicillin and kanamycin resistant clones originating from streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus genomes. we report molecular characterization of the cloned inserts, which were fully sequenced and shown to confer ar phenotype to recipient bacteria. we also show that metagenomics can be applied to food microbiota to identify underrepresented species carrying specific genes of interest.

TI  == applicability of a lactobacillus amylovorus strain as co-culture for natural folate bio-enrichment of fermented milk.
AB  == the ability of 55 strains from different lactobacillus species to produce folate  was investigated. in order to evaluate folic acid productivity, lactobacilli were cultivated in the folate-free culture medium (facm). most of the tested strains needed folate for growth. the production and the extent of vitamin accumulation were distinctive features of individual strains. lactobacillus amylovorus crl887  was selected for further studies because of its ability to produce significantly  higher concentrations of vitamin (81.2 +/- 5.4 mug/l). the safety of this newly identified folate producing strain was evaluated through healthy experimental mice. no bacterial translocation was detected in liver and spleen after consumption of crl887 during 7 days and no undesirable side effects were observed in the animals that received this strain. this strain in co-culture with previously selected folate producing starter cultures (lactobacillus bulgaricus crl871, and streptococcus thermophilus crl803 and crl415) yielded a yogurt containing high folate concentrations (263.1 +/- 2.4 mug/l); a single portion of  which would provide 15% of the recommended dietary allowance. this is the first report where a lactobacillus amylovorus strain was successfully used as co-culture for natural folate bio-enrichment of fermented milk.

TI  == experimental study on the optimization of general conditions for a free-flow electrophoresis device with a thermoelectric cooler.
AB  == with a given free-flow electrophoresis device, reasonable conditions (electric field strength, carrier buffer conductivity, and flow rate) are crucial for an optimized separation. however, there has been no experimental study on how to choose reasonable general conditions for a free-flow electrophoresis device with  a thermoelectric cooler in view of joule heat generation. herein, comparative experiments were carried out to propose the selection procedure of general conditions in this study. the experimental results demonstrated that appropriate  conditions were (i) <67 v/cm electric field strength; (ii) lower than 1.3 ms/cm carrier buffer conductivity (tris-hcl: 20 mm tris was titrated by hcl to ph 8.0); and (iii) higher than 3.6 ml/min carrier buffer flow rate. furthermore, under inappropriate conditions (e.g. 400 v voltage and 40 mm tris-hcl carrier buffer),  the free-flow electrophoresis separation would be destroyed by bubbles caused by  more joule heating. additionally, a series of applications under the appropriate  conditions were performed with samples of model dyes, proteins (bovine serum albumin, myoglobin, and cytochrome c), and cells (escherichia coli, streptococcus thermophilus, and saccharomyces cerevisiae). the separation results showed that under the appropriate conditions, separation efficiency was obviously better than that in the previous experiments with randomly or empirically selected conditions.

TI  == preparation of low galactose yogurt using cultures of gal(+) streptococcus thermophilus in combination with lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is an important lactic starter used in the production  of yogurt. most strains of s. thermophilus are galactose negative (gal(-)) and are able to metabolize only glucose portion of lactose and expel galactose into the medium. this metabolic defect leads to the accumulation of free galactose in  yogurt, resulting in galactosemia among consumers. hence there is an absolute need to develop low galactose yogurt. therefore, in this study, three galactose positive (gal(+)) s. thermophilus strains from national collection of dairy cultures (ncdc) viz. ncdc 659 (ajm), ncdc 660 (jm1), ncdc 661 (km3) and a reference galactose negative (gal(-)) s. thermophilus ncdc 218 were used for preparation of low galactose yogurt. in milk fermented using s. thermophilus isolates alone, ncdc 659 released less galactose (0.27 %) followed by ncdc 661 (0.3 %) and ncdc 660 (0.45 %) after 10 h at 42 degrees c. milk was fermented in combination with gal(-) l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ncdc 04, in which ncdc 659 released least galactose upto 0.49 % followed by ncdc 661 (0.51 %) and ncdc 660 (0.60 %) than reference gal(-) ncdc 218(0.79 %). low galactose yogurt was prepared following standard procedure using gal(+) s. thermophilus isolates and gal(-) l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ncdc 04 in 1:1 ratio. among which low galactose yogurt by ncdc 659 combination contained less galactose 0.37 % followed by ncdc 661 (0.51 %), ncdc 660 (0.65 %) and reference gal(-) ncdc 218 (0.98 %) after 4 h of fermentation. this study clearly reveals that gal(+) s. thermophilus isolates can be paired with gal(-) l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus for developing low galactose yogurt.

TI  == effect of thermosonication on physicochemical, microbiological and sensorial characteristics of ayran during storage.
AB  == the aim of the study was to determine whether thermosonication extends the shelf  life of ayran, an acidic milk drink. the effect of thermosonication at different  temperatures (60, 70 and 80 degrees c) and times (1, 3 and 5 min) on the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics, and sensorial properties of  ayran during storage were investigated. according to the results, thermosonication applied at 60 degrees c decreased lower the bacteria counts, although the streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus counts decreased as the temperature and time increased. the yeast and  mold levels in samples treated with thermosonication were <1 log cfu ml(-1) during storage period. the ayran samples had non-newtonian behavior, and the consistency coefficients of the thermosonicated samples were significantly higher than that of the heat-treated samples. regarding serum separation, the most effective thermosonication treatment was applied at 70 degrees c for 3 min. the sensory properties of the thermosonicated samples were better than the thermal-treated samples after storage.

TI  == control of tyramine and histamine accumulation by lactic acid bacteria using bacteriocin forming lactococci.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the competitive effects of three bacteriocin producing strains of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis against two aminobiogenic lactic acid bacteria, i.e. the tyramine producing strain enterococcus faecalis ef37 and the histamine producing strain streptococcus thermophilus pri60, inoculated at different initial concentrations (from 2 to 6 log cfu/ml). the results showed that the three l. lactis subsp. lactis strains were able to produce bacteriocins: in particular, l. lactis subsp. lactis vr84 and eg46 produced, respectively, nisin z and lacticin 481, while for the strains  cg27 the bacteriocin has not been yet identified, even if its peptidic nature has been demonstrated. the co-culture of e. faecalis ef37 in combination with lactococci significantly reduced the growth potential of this aminobiogenic strain, both in terms of growth rate and maximum cell concentration, depending on the initial inoculum level of e. faecalis. tyramine accumulation was strongly reduced when e. faecalis ef37 was inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml and, to a lesser extent, at 3 log cfu/ml, as a result of a lower cell load of the aminobiogenic strain. all the lactococci were more efficient in inhibiting streptococci in comparison with e. faecalis ef37; in particular, l. lactis subsp. lactis vr84 induced the death of s. thermophilus pri60 and allowed the detection of histamine traces only at higher streptococci inoculum levels (5-6 log cfu/ml). the other two lactococcal strains did not show a lethal action against s. thermophilus pri60, but were able to reduce its growth extent and histamine accumulation, even if l. lactis subsp. lactis eg46 was less effective when the initial streptococci  concentration was 5 and 6 log cfu/ml. this preliminary study has clarified some aspects regarding the ratio between bacteriocinogenic strains and aminobiogenic strains with respect to the possibility to accumulate ba and has also showed that different bacteriocins can have different effects on ba production on the same strain. this knowledge is essentially aimed to use bacteriocinogenic lactococci as a predictable strategy against aminobiogenic bacteria present in cheese or other fermented foods.

TI  == functional implications and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the peptide transporter ptr2 in saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  == the peptide transporter ptr2 plays a central role in di- or tripeptide import in  saccharomyces cerevisiae. although ptr2 transcription has been extensively analyzed in terms of upregulation by the ubr1-cup9 circuit, the structural and functional information for this transporter is limited. here we identified 14 amino acid residues required for peptide import through ptr2 based on the crystallographic information of streptococcus thermophilus peptide transporter peptst and based on the conservation of primary sequences among the proton-dependent oligopeptide transporters (pots). expression of ptr2 carrying one of the 14 mutations of which the corresponding residues of peptst are involved in peptide recognition, salt bridge interaction, or peptide translocation failed to enable ptr2deltatrp1 cell growth in alanyl-tryptophan (ala-trp) medium. we observed that ptr2 underwent rapid degradation after cycloheximide treatment (half-life, approximately 1 h), and this degradation depended on rsp5 ubiquitin ligase. the ubiquitination of ptr2 most likely occurs  at the n-terminal lysines 16, 27, and 34. simultaneous substitution of arginine for the three lysines fully prevented ptr2 degradation. ptr2 mutants of the presumed peptide-binding site (e92q, r93k, k205r, w362l, and e480d) exhibited severe defects in peptide import and were subjected to rsp5-dependent degradation when cells were moved to ala-trp medium, whereas, similar to what occurs in the wild-type ptr2, mutant proteins of the intracellular gate were upregulated. these results suggest that ptr2 undergoes quality control and the defects in peptide binding and the concomitant conformational change render ptr2 subject to efficient ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.

TI  == reconstituted yogurt from yogurt cultured milk powder mix has better overall characteristics than reconstituted yogurt from commercial yogurt powder.
AB  == for manufacture of commercial yogurt powder, yogurt has to go through a drying process, which substantially lowers the yogurt culture counts, so the potential health benefits of the yogurt culture bacteria are reduced. also, upon reconstitution, commercial yogurt powder does not taste like yogurt and has an off-flavor. the objective was to study the microbial, physicochemical, and sensory characteristics of reconstituted yogurt from yogurt cultured milk powder  (ycmp) mix and reconstituted yogurt from commercial yogurt powder (cyp). the cyp  reconstituted yogurt was the control and ycmp mix reconstituted yogurt was the treatment. microbial and physicochemical characteristics of the cyp reconstituted yogurt and ycmp mix reconstituted yogurt were analyzed daily for the first week and then weekly for a period of 8 wk. sensory consumer testing of cyp reconstituted yogurt and ycmp mix reconstituted yogurt was conducted with 100 consumers. at 56 d, ycmp mix reconstituted yogurt had 5 log cfu/ml higher counts  of streptococcus thermophilus than the control (cyp reconstituted yogurt). also,  lactobacillus bulgaricus counts of ycmp mix reconstituted yogurt were 6.55 log cfu/ml at 28 d and were 5.35 log cfu/ml at 56 d, whereas the cyp reconstituted yogurt from 28 d onwards had a count of <10 cfu/ml. the ycmp mix reconstituted yogurt also had significantly higher apparent viscosity and sensory scores for appearance, color, aroma, taste, thickness, overall liking, consumer acceptability, and purchase intent than cyp reconstituted yogurt. overall, ycmp mix reconstituted yogurt had more desirable characteristics than cyp reconstituted yogurt.

TI  == short communication: viability of culture organisms in honey-enriched acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type fermented camel milk.
AB  == the aim of this research was to monitor the survival during refrigerated storage  of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in cultured dairy foods made from camel and, for comparison, cow milks supplemented with black locust (robinia pseudoacacia l.) honey and fermented by an acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type culture. two liters of dromedary camel milk and 2 l of cow milk were heated to 90 degrees c and held for 10 min, then cooled to 40 degrees c. one half of both types of milk was fortified with black locust honey at the rate of 5.0% (wt/vol), whereas the other half was devoid of honey and served as a control. the camel and cow milks with and without honey were subsequently inoculated with abt-5 culture and were fermented at 37 degrees c until a ph value of 4.6 was reached. thereafter, the probiotic fermented milks were cooled to 15 degrees c in ice water and were each separated  into 18 fractions that were transferred in sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes. after 24 h of cooling at 8 degrees c (d 0), the samples were stored at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees c). three tubes of all 4 products (i.e., fermented camel and cow milks with and without honey) were taken at each sampling time (i.e., following 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d of storage), and the counts of characteristic microorganisms and those of certain spoilage microbes (yeasts, molds, coliforms, escherichia coli) were enumerated. the entire experimental program was repeated twice. the results showed that addition of black locust honey at 5% to heat-treated camel and cow milks did not influence the growth and  survival of starter streptococci during production and subsequent refrigerated storage of fermented abt milks. in contrast, honey improved retention of viability of b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 in the camel milk-based product during storage at 4 degrees c up to 5 wk. no spoilage organisms were detected in any of  the samples tested in this study. in conclusion, supplementation of cultured dairy foods, especially those made from camel milk, with honey is recommended because honey is a healthy natural sweetener with a variety of beneficial microbiological, nutritional, and sensory properties.

AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. survival of e. coli o157:h7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain e. coli o157:h7 cocktail (7 log(10) cfu/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% nacl brine at 10 and 21 masculinec for 28 d. nacl concentration, water activity (a(w)), ph,  and numbers of e. coli o157:h7 and lactic acid bacteria (lab) were determined in  cheese and brine. e. coli o157:h7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculinec regardless of the presence of starter lab, although the latter significantly enhanced e. coli o157:h7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculinec. e. coli o157:h7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) cfu/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% nacl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter lab and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) cfu/g, respectively, in the absence of starter lab at 10 masculinec. the pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. the salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the nacl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. values of ph and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.

TI  == effects of streptococcus thermophilus on volatile sulfur compounds produced by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == halitosis as oral malodour is an unpleasant odour caused by volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). vscs are produced primarily by anaerobic bacteria that abundantly produce proteinase as trypsin-like enzyme. general therapies, such as  mouthwash and plaque control, do not provide a continuous effect on oral halitosis. streptococcus thermophilus is a probiotic bacterium that is beneficial for human health. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of s. thermophilus on porphyromonas gingivalis-producing vscs and to analyze the inhibitory mechanism of halitosis. p. gingivalis was cultured with or without s.  thermophilus, and the emission of vscs from the spent culture medium was measured by gas chromatography. in order to analyze the inhibitory effect, the antibacterial activity of s. thermophilus against p. gingivalis was assessed. after the spent culture medium or whole bacterial of s. thermophilus was mixed with the spent culture medium of p. gingivalis, vscs were again measured by gas chromatograph. when s. thermophilus and p. gingivalis were co-cultivated, vscs were present at a lower level than those of single-cultured p. gingivalis. s. thermophilus inhibited growth of p. gingivalis, and the whole bacteria and the spent culture medium of s. thermophilus reduced emission of vscs gas. s. thermophilus may reduce oral malodour by inhibition of p. gingivalis growth and neutralizing vscs with their metabolites or themselves.

AB  == the present investigation examined the effects of supplementation of milk peptide fractions produced by enzymatic hydrolysis on the fermentation of reconstituted skim milk (rsm). changes in ph, cell growth, proteolytic activity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity were monitored during fermentation of rsm by pure cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus  helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus. the study showed that supplementation with peptide fractions of different molecular weights did not significantly affect the bacterial growth in  rsm. all bacteria showed an increased proteolytic activity in rsm supplemented with large peptides (>10 kda), and l. helveticus in general exhibited the highest proteolytic activity among the bacteria studied. the ace-inhibitory activity was  observed to be the maximum in rsm supplemented with larger peptides (>10 kda) for all bacteria. the results suggest that proteolysis by bacteria leads to increased production of ace-inhibitory peptides compared to the supplemented peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis.

AB  == pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna targeting rna, community-level physiological profiles made with biolog ecoplates, proteolysis, and volatile component (voc) analyses were mainly used to characterize the manufacture and ripening of the pasta filata cheese caciocavallo pugliese. plate counts revealed that cheese manufacture affected the microbial ecology. the results agreed with those from culture-independent approaches. as shown by urea-page, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (rp-hplc), and free-amino-acid (faa) analyses, the extent of secondary proteolysis mainly increased after 30 to 45 days of ripening. vocs and volatile free fatty acids (vffa) were identified by a purge-and-trap method (pt) and solid-phase microextraction (spme) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms), respectively. except for aldehydes, the levels of most of vocs and vffa mainly increased from 30 to 45 days onwards. as shown through pyrosequencing analysis, raw cows' milk was contaminated by firmicutes (53%), proteobacteria (39%), bacteroidetes (7.8%), actinobacteria (0.06%), and fusobacteria (0.03%), with heterogeneity at the genus level. the primary starter streptococcus thermophilus dominated the curd population. other genera occurred at low incidence or sporadically. the microbial dynamics reflected on the overall physiological diversity. at 30 days, a microbial succession was clearly highlighted. the relative abundance of streptococcus sp. and especially st. thermophilus decreased, while that of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus sp., and especially lactobacillus paracasei increased consistently. despite the lower relative abundance compared to st. thermophilus, mesophilic lactobacilli were the only organisms positively correlated with the concentration of faas, area of hydrophilic peptide peaks, and several vocs (e.g., alcohols, ketones, esters and all furans). this study showed that a core microbiota was naturally selected during middle ripening, which seemed to be the main factor responsible for cheese ripening.

TI  == high-throughput sequencing of microbial communities in poro cheese, an artisanal  mexican cheese.
AB  == the bacterial diversity and structure of poro cheese, an artisanal food, was analysed by high-throughput sequencing (454 pyrosequencing) in order to gain insight about changes in bacterial communities associated with the cheese-making  process. dairy samples consisting of milk, fermented whey, curd and ripened cheese (during 7 and 60 d) were collected from three manufacturers located in the state of tabasco, mexico during dry (march-june) and rainy (august-november) seasons. independently of producer and season, raw milk samples displayed the highest diversity in bacterial communities. in raw milk, genera found were macrococcus, staphylococcus, enterococcus, streptococcus, lactobacillus and enhydrobacter. diversity in whey, curd and cheese was lower, principally containing streptococcus and lactobacillus; however, bacteria such as staphylococcus, acinetobacter, chryseobacterium, bacillus, sediminibacter, lactococcus and enterococcus were occasionally present. after curdling step, the  most dominant and abundant species were streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii.

TI  == crispr-cas: an efficient tool for genome engineering of virulent bacteriophages.
AB  == bacteriophages are now widely recognized as major players in a wide variety of ecosystems. novel genes are often identified in newly isolated phages as well as  in environmental metavirome studies. most of these novel viral genes have unknown functions but appear to be coding for small, non-structural proteins. to understand their biological role, very efficient genetic tools are required to modify them, especially in the genome of virulent phages. we first show that specific point mutations and large deletions can be engineered in the genome of the virulent phage 2972 using the streptococcus thermophilus crispr-cas type ii-a system as a selective pressure to increase recombination efficiencies. of significance, all the plaques tested contained recombinant phages with the desired mutation. furthermore, we show that the crispr-cas engineering system can be used to efficiently introduce a functional methyltransferase gene into a virulent phage genome. finally, synthetic crispr bacteriophage insensitive mutants were constructed by cloning a spacer-repeat unit in a low-copy vector illustrating the possibility to target multiple regions of the phage genome. taken together, this data shows that the crispr-cas system is an efficient and adaptable tool for editing the otherwise intractable genomes of virulent phages and to better understand phage-host interactions.

TI  == the cation diffusion facilitator protein emfa of rhizobium etli belongs to a novel subfamily of mn(2+)/fe(2+) transporters conserved in alpha-proteobacteria.
AB  == manganese (mn(2+)) plays a key role in important cellular functions such as oxidative stress response and bacterial virulence. the mechanisms of mn(2+) homeostasis are not fully understood, there are few data regarding the functional and taxonomic diversity of mn(2+) exporters. our recent phylogeny of the cation diffusion facilitator (cdf) family of transporters classified the bacterial mn(2+)-cdf transporters characterized to date, streptococcus pneumoniae mnte and  deinococcus radiodurans dr1236, into two monophyletic groups. dr1236 was shown to belong to the highly-diverse metal specificity clade vi, together with ttczrb, a  zn(2+)/cd(2+) transporter from thermus thermophilus, the fe(2+) transporter sll1263 from synechocystis sp and eight uncharacterized homologs whose potential  mn(2+)/zn(2+)/cd(2+)/fe(2+) specificities could not be accurately inferred because only eleven proteins were grouped in this clade. a new phylogeny inferred from the alignment of 197 clade vi homologs revealed three novel subfamilies of uncharacterized proteins. remarkably, one of them contained 91 uncharacterized alpha-proteobacteria transporters (46% of the protein data set) grouped into a single subfamily. the mn(2+)/fe(2+) specificity of this subfamily was proposed through the functional characterization of the rhizobium etli rhe_ch03072 gene. this gene was upregulated by mn(2+), zn(2+), cd(2+) and fe(2+) but conferred only mn(2+) resistance to r. etli. the expression of the rhe_ch03072 gene in an e. coli mntp/zitb/znta mutant did not relieve either zn(2+) or mn(2+) stress but slightly increased its fe(2+) resistance. these results indicate that the rhe_ch03072 gene, now designated as emfa, encodes for a bacterial mn(2+)/fe(2+) resistance cdf protein, having orthologs in more than 60 alpha-proteobacterial species.

TI  == energy and ileal digestible amino acid concentrations for growing pigs and performance of weanling pigs fed fermented or conventional soybean meal.
AB  == a new strategy of co-inoculating bacillus subtilis ma139 with streptococcus thermophilus and saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to produce fermented soybean meal (fsbm). three experiments were conducted to determine the concentration of digestible energy (de) and metabolizable energy (me) (exp. 1), apparent ileal digestibility (aid) and standardized ileal digestibility (sid) of amino acids (aa) (exp. 2), and feeding value (exp. 3) of fsbm produced by this new strategy (nfsb) compared with soybean meal (sbm) and conventionally available fsbm (suprotein). in exp. 1, twenty-four barrows (initial body weight [bw] of 32.2 +/-1.7 kg) were randomly allotted to 1 of 4 diets with 6 replicates per diet. a corn basal diet and 3 diets based on a mixture of corn and 1 of 3 soybean products listed above were formulated and the de and me contents were determined  by the difference method. the results showed that there were no differences in de and me between sbm and either fsbm product (p>0.05). in exp. 2, eight barrows (initial bw of 26.8+/-1.5 kg) were fitted with ileal t-cannulaes and used in a replicated 4x4 latin square design. three corn-starch-based diets were formulated using each of the 3 soybean products as the sole source of aa. a nitrogen-free diet was also formulated to measure endogenous losses of aa. the results showed that the sid of all aa except arginine and histidine was similar for nfsb and sbm (p>0.05), but suprotein had greater (p<0.05) sid of most aa except lysine, aspartate, glycine and proline than nfsb. in exp. 3, a total of 144 piglets (initial bw of 8.8+/-1.2 kg) were blocked by weight and fed 1 of 4 diets including a control diet with 24% sbm as well as diets containing 6% and 12% nfsb or 12% suprotein added at the expense of sbm. during d 15 to 28, replacing sbm with 6% nfsb significantly improved average daily gain (adg) and average daily feed intake (adfi) (p<0.05) for nursery piglets. during the overall experiment, adg of piglets fed diets containing 6% nfsb was significantly greater (p<0.05) than that of piglets fed sbm. in conclusion, fermentation with the new strategy did not affect the energy content or the aid and the sid of aa in sbm. however, inclusion of 6% nfsb in diets fed to nursery piglets improved performance after weaning likely as a result of better nutritional status and reduced immunological challenge.

TI  == characterization of an ebosin derivative produced by heterologous gene replacement in streptomyces sp. 139.
AB  == background: ebosin is a novel exopolysaccharide (eps) produced by streptomyces sp. 139 and evidenced to possess an anti-rheumatic arthritis activity in vivo. the ebosin biosynthesis gene cluster (ste) consists of 27 orfs and ste7 has previously been demonstrated to code for a fucosyltransferase, which plays an essential role in the formation of repeating sugar units during ebosin production. aiming to generate derivatives of ebosin for better activity, we replaced ste7 with a gene encoding for a glucosyltransferase (gtf) from streptococcus thermophilus. results: this alteration resulted in a novel ebosin derivative (eps-7 g) with its monosaccharide composition dramatically changed, especially in the proportion of glucose which increased from 1.1% (ebosin) to 84.01% (eps-7 g). in an elisa analysis, eps-7 g exhibited a higher binding activity for il-1r, as a competitor of interleukin-1, than that of ebosin. it also exhibited a higher inhibitory effect on the activity of il-1beta-converting  enzyme and production of il-1beta in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (fls). in addition, experiments with acute inflamed mice induced by croton oil showed a significantly higher anti-inflammatory activity of eps-7 g compared with ebosin.  conclusions: the new ebosin derivative eps-7 g is more bioactive than ebosin evaluated by a series of experiments. this is the first report demonstrating a modification of eps structure via heterologous gene replacement in streptomyces.

TI  == development of a non-dairy probiotic fermented product based on almond milk and inulin.
AB  == a new fermented almond "milk" that combined the properties of both almonds and probiotics was considered to cover the current versatile health-promoting foods'  demand. almond milk fermentation with probiotic lactobacillus reuteri and streptococcus thermophilus was studied by using a central composite design with response surface methodology, and different factors (glucose, fructose, inulin and starters) were optimised to assure high probiotic survivals in the final product. the optimal formulation was physicochemically characterised throughout cold storage (28 days) and both probiotic survivals to in vitro digestion and proteolysis were quantified. results showed that a high probiotic population (>107 cfu/ml) was obtained in the previously optimised almond milk throughout storage time, which correspond to the addition of 0.75 g of glucose/100 ml, 0.75  g of fructose/100 ml, 2 g/100 ml inulin and 6 ml/100 ml inoculum. glucose was used as the main nutrient and the production of mannitol by l. reuteri was detected. the fermentation process increased the viscosity values, forming a weak gel structure, whose physical properties hardly changed. probiotic bacteria notably survived (51%) to the in vitro digestion, surely related to the inulin presence, which would add value to the developed product by enhancing the potential health benefits of its consumption.

TI  == crispr-induced distributed immunity in microbial populations.
AB  == in bacteria and archaea, viruses are the primary infectious agents, acting as virulent, often deadly pathogens. a form of adaptive immune defense known as crispr-cas enables microbial cells to acquire immunity to viral pathogens by recognizing specific sequences encoded in viral genomes. the unique biology of this system results in evolutionary dynamics of host and viral diversity that cannot be fully explained by the traditional models used to describe microbe-virus coevolutionary dynamics. here, we show how the crispr-mediated adaptive immune response of hosts to invading viruses facilitates the emergence of an evolutionary mode we call distributed immunity - the coexistence of multiple, equally-fit immune alleles among individuals in a microbial population. we use an eco-evolutionary modeling framework to quantify distributed immunity and demonstrate how it emerges and fluctuates in multi-strain communities of hosts and viruses as a consequence of crispr-induced coevolution under conditions of low viral mutation and high relative numbers of viral protospacers. we demonstrate that distributed immunity promotes sustained diversity and stability  in host communities and decreased viral population density that can lead to viral extinction. we analyze sequence diversity of experimentally coevolving populations of streptococcus thermophilus and their viruses where crispr-cas is active, and find the rapid emergence of distributed immunity in the host population, demonstrating the importance of this emergent phenomenon in evolving  microbial communities.

TI  == nadh oxidase of streptococcus thermophilus 1131 is required for the effective yogurt fermentation with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2038.
AB  == we previously reported that dissolved oxygen (do) suppresses yogurt fermentation  with an industrial starter culture composed of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) 2038 and streptococcus thermophilus 1131, and also found that reducing the do in the medium prior to fermentation (deoxygenated fermentation) shortens the fermentation time. in this study, we found that deoxygenated fermentation primarily increased the cell number of s. thermophilus  1131 rather than that of l. bulgaricus 2038, resulting in earlier l-lactate and formate accumulation. measurement of the do concentration and hydrogen peroxide generation in the milk medium suggested that do is mainly removed by s. thermophilus 1131. the results using an h2o-forming nadh oxidase (nox)-defective  mutant of s. thermophilus 1131 revealed that nox is the major oxygen-consuming enzyme of the bacterium. yogurt fermentation with the s. thermophilus deltanox mutant and l. bulgaricus 2038 was significantly slower than with s. thermophilus  1131 and l. bulgaricus 2038, and the do concentrations of the mixed culture did not decrease to less than 2 mg/kg within 3 hr. these observations suggest that nox of s. thermophilus 1131 contributes greatly to yogurt fermentation, presumably by removing the do in milk.

TI  == production of folate in oat bran fermentation by yeasts isolated from barley and  diverse foods.
AB  == aims: the focus of the research was to identify yeasts from barley kernels in order to study their folate production capability while maintaining high viscosity caused by soluble fibres in oat bran fermentation. methods and results: the 65 isolated yeasts were characterized by api carbohydrate utilization tests,  and assays for extracellular enzyme activities were the following: amylase, beta-glucanase, cellulase or cmcase, lipase, protease and xylanase. yeasts were identified by partial dna sequencing of the 25s d1/d2 and its1-5.8s-its2 regions. they belonged to the genera aureobasidium, cryptococcus, pseudozyma and rhodotorula. folate production was determined from supernatant and cells grown in a rich laboratory medium or directly from oat bran solution inoculated with the appropriate yeast. food yeasts, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida milleri, kluyveromyces marxianus and galactomyces geotrichum, were used for comparison. most of the yeasts isolated from barley destroyed the solid, viscous structure of the oat bran solution, indicating that they degraded the viscosity-generating soluble fibres, considered to be nutritionally advantageous. the best folate producers were s. cerevisiae, followed by pseudozyma sp., rhodotorula glutinis and k. marxianus. the yeasts maintaining high viscosity were used together with lactic acid bacteria (lab) streptococcus thermophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus  to ferment oat bran solution. none of the yeasts isolated from barley, contrary to s. cerevisiae and c. milleri, produced together with lab significant amounts of folate. conclusions: fermentative yeasts together with lab are potential for use in developing novel high folate content healthy foods and snacks from oat bran. significance and impact of the study: high soluble fibre content and high natural folate content but low energy content food and snack products with pleasant fermentation aroma provide possibilities for new developments in the food industry.

TI  == combination of heterogeneous catalase and superoxide dismutase protects bifidobacterium longum strain ncc2705 from oxidative stress.
AB  == bifidobacteria are generally sensitive to oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ros). to improve oxidative-stress tolerance, the superoxide dismutase (sod) gene from streptococcus thermophilus (stsoda) and the heme-dependent catalase (kat) gene from lactobacillus plantarum (lpkatl) were heterologously expressed in bifidobacterium longum strain ncc2705. three types of strain ncc2705 transformants were obtained: with transgenic sod expression, with  transgenic kat expression, and with coexpression of the two genes. intracellular  expression of the genes and their functional role in oxidative-stress resistance  were evaluated. in response to oxidative stress, b. longum ncc2705/pdp401-lpkatl  (expressing lpkatl) and ncc2705/pdp-kat-sod (coexpressing lpkatl and stsoda) rapidly degraded exogenous h2o2 and the peroxides generated as a byproduct of aerobic cultivation, preventing oxidative damage to dna and rna. individual expression of stsoda or lpkatl both improved b. longum ncc2705 cell viability. survival rate of strain ncc2705 was further improved by combining sod and kat expression. the two enzymes played complementary roles in ros-scavenging pathways, and coexpression led to a synergistic beneficial effect under conditions of intensified oxidative stress. our results illustrate that heterogeneous expression of heme-dependent kat and mn(2+)-dependent sod is functional in the b. longum oxidative-stress response, and synergistic protection is achieved when their expressions are combined.

TI  == the naturally competent strain streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9 as a new tool to  anchor heterologous proteins on the cell surface.
AB  == background: from fundamental studies to industrial processes, synthesis of heterologous protein by micro-organisms is widely employed. the secretion of soluble heterologous proteins in the extracellular medium facilitates their recovery, while their attachment to the cell surface permits the use of the recombinant host cells as protein or peptide supports. one of the key points to carry out heterologous expression is to choose the appropriate host. we propose to enlarge the panel of heterologous secretion hosts by using streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9. this lactic acid bacterium has a generally recognised as safe status, is widely used in the manufacture of yogurts, fermented milks and cheeses, and is easy to transform by natural competence. this study demonstrates  the feasibility of secretion of a heterologous protein anchored to the cell surface by s. thermophilus. for this, we used the cell envelope proteinase (cep)  prth of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 cirm-bia 103. results: using s. thermophilus lmd-9 as the background host, three recombinant strains were constructed: i) a negative control corresponding to s. thermophilus prts- mutant  where the prts gene encoding its cep was partially deleted; ii) a prth+ mutant expressing the l. helveticus prth pro-protein with its own motif (s-layer type) of cell-wall attachment and iii) a prth+wans mutant expressing prth pro-protein with the lpxtg anchoring motif from prts. the prth+ and prth+wans genes expression levels were measured by rt-qpcr in the corresponding mutants and compared to that of prts gene in the strain lmd-9. the expression levels of both  fused prth ceps genes, regardless of the anchoring motif, reached up-to more than 76% of the wild-type prts expression level. ceps were sought and identified on the cell surface of lmd-9 wild-type strain, prth+ and prth+wans mutants using shaving technique followed by peptide identification with tandem mass spectrometry, demonstrating that the heterologous secretion and anchoring of a protein of more than 200 kda was efficient. the anchoring to the cell-wall seems  to be more efficient when the lpxtg motif of prts was used instead of the s-layer motif of prth. conclusions: we demonstrated s. thermophilus lmd-9 could heterologously secrete a high molecular weight protein and probably covalently anchor it to the cell-wall.

AB  == green tea and its constituents are known for a wide range of health-promoting properties. they may exert antimicrobial action but without altering lactic acid  bacteria. the aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of green tea addition on the selected properties of probiotic milks. bioyogurts (fermented with abt-1 coculture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12) and acidophilus milks (fermented with pure l. acidophilus la-5 culture) with addition of 0, 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) green tea infusion (gti) were produced and analyzed for the antioxidant capacity by the "diphenyl picrylhydrazyl" (dpph) and "ferric-reducing antioxidant power" (frap) methods, acidity, the count of starter bacteria, and sensory properties at the 1st, 7th, 14th, and 21st day of cold storage. the 15% addition  of gti to the acidophilus milk significantly reduced the lactic acid production during the whole study. the gti had no impact on the level of s. thermophilus and b. lactis bb-12 in bioyogurts, and its effect on the count of l. acidophilus la-5 depended on the concentration and probiotic milk type. gti similarly and in a dose-dependent manner enhanced the antioxidant capacity of both milk types. there were no significant differences between the sensory notes received for bioyogurts, whereas acidophilus milks with tea were less appreciated by the panelists. in conclusion, green tea could be successfully used as a functional additive for selected probiotic milks enhancing their health benefits, but the proper selection of tea additive and starter culture is recommended.

AB  == competence for natural dna transformation is a tightly controlled developmental process in streptococci. in mutans and salivarius species, the abundance of the central competence regulator sigma(x) is regulated at two levels: transcriptional, by the comrs signaling system via the sigma(x)/comx/sigx-inducing peptide (xip), and posttranscriptional, by the adaptor protein meca and its associated clp atpase, clpc. in this study, we further investigated the mechanism and function of the meca-clpc control system in the salivarius species streptococcus thermophilus. using in vitro approaches,  we showed that meca specifically interacts with both sigma(x) and clpc, suggesting the formation of a ternary sigma(x)-meca-clpc complex. moreover, we demonstrated that meca ultimately targets sigma(x) for its degradation by the clpcp protease in an atp-dependent manner. we also identify a short sequence (18  amino acids) in the n-terminal domain of sigma(x) as essential for the interaction with meca and subsequent sigma(x) degradation. finally, increased transformability of a meca-deficient strain in the presence of subinducing xip concentrations suggests that the meca-clpcp proteolytic complex acts as an additional locking device to prevent competence under inappropriate conditions. a model of the interplay between comrs and meca-clpcp in the control of sigma(x) activity is proposed.

TI  == bacteriophage-insensitive mutants for high quality crescenza manufacture.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is a thermophilic lactic acid bacterium used as starter culture for the manufacture of fermented dairy products. for the production of crescenza and other soft cheeses, sacco has developed and provides  dairies with three different defined blends of s. thermophilus strains. each blend contains two different s. thermophilus strains. the strains were selected based on their unique technological properties as well as different phage profiles. analysis of 133 whey samples collected in 2009-2010 from italian dairies showed a high prevalence (about 50%) of bacteriophage attacks on the blend st020. more specifically, the strain s. thermophilus st1a was found to be the preferred target of the bacteriophages. a bacteriophage insensitive mutant (bim5) of the phage-sensitive strain st1a was successfully developed and used to  substitute strain st1a in the crescenza starter culture st020. the strain bim5 showed identical technological and industrial traits as those of the phage-sensitive strain st1a. the improved resistance of the modified crescenza starter culture st020r was confirmed at italian dairies, and its effectiveness monitored on 122 whey samples collected in 2011-2012. compared to the previous values (2009-2010), the use of the phage-hardened blend st020r allowed reducing of frequency of phage attacks from about 50 to less than 5% of the whey samples investigated.

TI  == genomic insights into high exopolysaccharide-producing dairy starter bacterium streptococcus thermophilus ascc 1275.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus ascc 1275 (st 1275), a typical dairy starter bacterium, yields the highest known amount (~1,000 mg/l) of exopolysaccharide (eps) in milk among the species of s. thermophilus. the addition of this starter  in milk fermentation exhibited texture modifying properties for fermented dairy foods such as yogurt and cheese in the presence of eps as its important metabolite. in this genomic study, a novel eps gene cluster for eps assembly of repeating unit has been reported. it contains two-pair epsc-epsd genes which are  assigned to determine the chain length of eps. this also suggests this organism produces two types of epss - capsular and ropy eps, as observed in our previous studies. additionally, st 1275 appears to exhibit effective proteolysis system and sophisticated stress response systems to stressful conditions, and has the highest number of four separate crispr/cas loci. these features may be conducive  to milk adaptation of this starter and against undesirable bacteriophage infections which leads to failure of milk fermentation. insights into the genome  of st 1275 suggest that this strain may be a model high eps-producing dairy starter.

TI  == the three major types of crispr-cas systems function independently in crispr rna  biogenesis in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == crispr-cas systems are small rna-based immune systems that protect prokaryotes from invaders such as viruses and plasmids. we have investigated the features and biogenesis of the crispr (cr)rnas in streptococcus thermophilus (sth) strain dgcc7710, which possesses four different crispr-cas systems including representatives from the three major types of crispr-cas systems. our results indicate that the crrnas from each crispr locus are specifically processed into divergent crrna species by cas proteins (and non-coding rnas) associated with the respective locus. we find that the csm type iii-a and cse type i-e crrnas are specifically processed by cas6 and cse3 (cas6e), respectively, and retain an 8-nucleotide crispr repeat sequence tag 5' of the invader-targeting sequence. the cse type i-e crrnas also retain a 21-nucleotide 3' repeat tag. the crrnas from the two csn type ii-a systems in sth consist of a 5'-truncated targeting sequence and a 3' tag; however, these are distinct in size between the two. moreover, the  csn1 (cas9) protein associated with one csn locus functions specifically in the production of crrnas from that locus. our findings indicate that multiple crispr-cas systems can function independently in crrna biogenesis within a given  organism - an important consideration in engineering coexisting crispr-cas pathways.

TI  == enzymatic synthesis of bioinformatically predicted microcin c-like compounds encoded by diverse bacteria.
AB  == abstract the trojan horse escherichia coli antibiotic microcin c (mcc) consists of a heptapeptide attached to adenosine through a phosphoramidate linkage. mcc is synthesized by the mccb enzyme, which terminally adenylates the ribosomally synthesized heptapeptide precursor mcca. the peptide part is responsible for mcc  uptake; it is degraded inside the cell to release a toxic nonhydrolyzable aspartyl-adenylate. bionformatic analysis reveals that diverse bacterial genomes  encoding mccb homologues also contain adjacent short open reading frames that may encode mcca-like adenylation substrates. using chemically synthesized predicted peptide substrates and recombinant cognate mccb protein homologs, adenylated products were obtained in vitro for predicted mcca peptide-mccb enzyme pairs from helicobacter pylori, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus johnsonii, bartonella washoensis, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and synechococcus sp. some adenylated products were shown to inhibit the growth of e. coli by targeting aspartyl-trna synthetase, the target of mcc. importance our results prove that mcc-like adenylated peptides are widespread and are encoded by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and by cyanobacteria, opening ways for analyses of physiological functions of these compounds and for creation of microcin c-like antibiotics targeting various bacteria.

TI  == a probiotic preparation duolac-gold ameliorates dextran sulphate sodium-induced mouse colitis by downregulating the expression of il-6.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms that confer a health benefit on the host. duolac-gold is a mixture of six probiotic bacteria containing three species of bifidobacteria, two species of lactobacillus, and streptococcus thermophilus [corrected]. the aim of this study was to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of duolac-gold in an inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) mouse model. ibd was induced by administering 1.5% dextran sulfate sodium (dss) for 10 days. after induction of dss-induced colitis, duolac-gold was orally administered at three different concentrations. interestingly, duolac-gold treatment accelerated ibd healing, and anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by weight loss, length of the colon, and  a microscopic damage score by histology. the expression of inflammatory related cytokines was measured in colon tissues and serum. of these cytokines, the expression of interleukin-6 decreased remarkably after duolac-gold treatment. taken together, these results suggest that duolac-gold treatment is effective in  ibd healing by regulating il-6.

TI  == characterization of teta-like gene encoding for a major facilitator superfamily efflux pump in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == efflux pumps are membrane proteins involved in the active extrusion of a wide range of structurally dissimilar substrates from cells. a multidrug efflux pump named teta belonging to the major facilitator superfamily (mfs) of transporters was identified in the streptococcus thermophilus dsm 20617(t) genome. the teta-like gene was found in the genomes of a number of s. thermophilus strains sequenced to date and in streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198, suggesting a possible horizontal gene transfer event between these two streptococcus species,  which are both adapted to the milk environment. flow cytometry (single-cell) analysis revealed bistable teta activity in the s. thermophilus population, and teta-like gene over-expression resulted in a reduced susceptibility to ethidium bromide, tetracycline, and other toxic compounds even when the efflux pump was over-expressed in a strain naturally lacking teta-like gene.

AB  == currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (ph, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees c), as well as sensory preference among them. decreases in ph (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. only the yogurt  with s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and l. reuteri differed in  firmness. no differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. no changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. counts of s. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. counts of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/ml for 3 wk. probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of l. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/ml for 35 d, of l. casei for 7d, and of l. reuteri for 14 d. we found no significant sensory preference among  the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. however, the yogurt and fermented milk made with l. casei were better accepted. this study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.

TI  == comparative genomics of the dairy isolate streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 against related members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  == background: within the genus streptococcus, only streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. members of the sbsec have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 to the other sbsec genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. results: despite the fact that the sbsec species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus infantarius cj18 and streptococcus pasteurianus atcc 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. in addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of s. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. analysis of the s. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy lactococcus lactis and s. thermophilus as potential donors. in addition, s. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in s. gallolyticus. for example, s. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of s. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy s. infantarius cj18, but also for the blood isolate s. pasteurianus atcc 43144. conclusions: our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of s. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. during this  process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. finally, s. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative sbsec virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  == lactose digestion from yogurt: mechanism and relevance.
AB  == yogurt is traditionally consumed throughout the world among populations who are seemingly unable to digest lactose. this review provides a historical overview of the studies that show lactose digestion and tolerance from yogurt by lactose-intolerant people. the lactose in yogurt is digested more efficiently than other dairy sources of lactose because the bacteria inherent in yogurt assist with its digestion. the bacterial lactase survives the acidic conditions of the stomach, apparently being physically protected within the bacterial cells  and facilitated by the buffering capacity of yogurt. the increasing ph as the yogurt enters the small intestine and a slower gastrointestinal transit time allow the bacterial lactase to be active, digesting lactose from yogurt sufficiently to prevent symptoms in lactose-intolerant people. there is little difference in the lactase capability of different commercial yogurts, because they apparently contain lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus in sufficient quantities (10(8) bacteria/ml). however, lactobacillus acidophilus  appears to require cell membrane disruption to physically release the lactase. compared with unflavored yogurts, flavored yogurts appear to exhibit somewhat reduced lactase activity but are still well tolerated.

TI  == structural and functional analysis of a feob a143s g5 loop mutant explains the accelerated gdp release rate.
AB  == gtpases (g proteins) hydrolyze the conversion of gtp to gdp and free phosphate, comprising an integral part of prokaryotic and eukaryotic signaling, protein biosynthesis and cell division, as well as membrane transport processes. the g protein cycle is brought to a halt after gtp hydrolysis, and requires the release of gdp before a new cycle can be initiated. for eukaryotic heterotrimeric galphabetagamma proteins, the interaction with a membrane-bound g protein-coupled receptor catalyzes the release of gdp from the galpha subunit. structural and functional studies have implicated one of the nucleotide binding sequence motifs, the g5 motif, as playing an integral part in this release mechanism. indeed, a galphas g5 mutant (a366s) was shown to have an accelerated gdp release rate, mimicking a g protein-coupled receptor catalyzed release state. in the present study, we investigate the role of the equivalent residue in the g5 motif (residue a143) in the prokaryotic membrane protein feob from streptococcus thermophilus, which includes an n-terminal soluble g protein domain. the structure of this domain has previously been determined in the apo and gdp-bound states and in the  presence of a transition state analogue, revealing conformational changes in the  g5 motif. the a143 residue was mutated to a serine and analyzed with respect to changes in gtpase activity, nucleotide release rate, gdp affinity and structural  alterations. we conclude that the identity of the residue at this position in the g5 loop plays a key role in the nucleotide release rate by allowing the correct positioning and hydrogen bonding of the nucleotide base.

AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium of major importance to the  dairy industry as it is found in numerous cheeses and is one of the two bacterial species involved in the fermentation of yogurt. bacterial two-component signal transduction systems (tcss) play important roles in the process of bacterial environmental adaptation. s. thermophilus lmd-9 possesses eight such tcs systems; however, their functions have thus far been only poorly investigated. here, we focused on two of the tcss in lmd-9, tcs06 and tcs07, whose encoding genes are located close to each other on the chromosome, and are associated with those of abc transporters. tcs06 homologs are frequently found in lactobacillales, but their function has not yet been determined, while tcs07 and its upstream potential abc transporter are homologous to the bcers/ab system, which is involved in bacitracin resistance in bacillus and streptococcus species. to investigate the function(s) of tcs06 and tcs07, we constructed and characterized  deletion mutants and performed transcriptional analysis in the presence and absence of bacitracin. we show here that both tcs06 and tcs07 regulate the genes  in their close vicinity, in particular those encoding abc transporters. we propose that the response of s. thermophilus to bacitracin includes i) a bacitracin export system, regulated by tcs07 and constituting a bcers/ab-like detoxification module, and ii) the modification of cell-envelope properties via modulation of rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide synthesis, at least partially regulated by tcs06.

AB  == twelve lactic acid bacteria (lab), previously selected in vitro (gaglio et al., 2014), were evaluated in situ for their potential to act as starter cultures for  the continuous four-season production of vastedda-like cheese, made with raw ewes' milk. the strains belonged to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and streptococcus thermophilus. lab were first inoculated in multiple-strain combinations on the basis of their optimal growth temperatures in three process conditions which differed for milk treatment and medium for strain development: process 1, growth  of strains in the optimal synthetic media and pasteurised milk; process 2, growth of strains in whey based medium (wbm) and pasteurised milk; and process 3, growth of strains in wbm and raw milk. the strains that acidified the curds in short time, as shown by a ph drop, were all mesophilic and were then tested in a single inoculum through process 3. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis applied to the colonies isolated from the highest dilutions of samples confirmed the dominance of the added strains after curd acidification, stretching and storage. after 15days of refrigerated storage, the decrease in ph values showed an activity of the mesophilic strains at low temperatures, but only lc. lactis subsp. cremoris pon153, ln. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides pon259 and  pon559 increased their number during the 15days at 7 degrees c. a sensory evaluation indicated that the cheeses obtained by applying protocol 3 and by inoculation with lactococci are the most similar to the protected denomination of origin (pdo) cheese and received the best scores by the judges. thus, the experimental cheeses obtained with raw milk and inoculated with single and multiple combinations of lactococci were subjected to the analysis of the volatile organic compounds (vocs) carried out by a headspace solid phase microextraction (spme) technique coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (gc/ms). the dominance of lactococci over thermophilic lab of raw milk was verified during summer production and, based on the combination of voc profiles and sensory evaluation of the final cheeses, the multi-strain lactococcus culture resulted in the most suitable starter preparation for the full-year production of vastedda-like cheese.

AB  == the objective was to study folate production of yeast strains, bacteria isolated  from oat bran, and selected lactic acid bacteria as well as one propionibacterium in oat and barley based models. simultaneously, we aimed at sustaining the stability of viscosity, representing the physicochemical state of beta-glucan. total folate contents were determined microbiologically and vitamers for selected samples by uhplc. folate in yeast cells comprised mainly 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate. folate production by microbes in ypd medium was different to that in cereal fermentations where vitamers included 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate and formylated derivatives. microbes producing significant amounts of folate without affecting viscosity were saccharomyces cerevisiae alko743 and candida milleri abm4949 among yeasts and pseudomonas sp. on8 and janthinobacterium sp. rb4 among bacteria. net folate production was up to 120 ng/g after 24 h fermentation and could increase during 2-week storage. glucose addition increased the proportion of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. streptococcus thermophilus abm5097, lactobacillus reuteri, and propionibacterium  sp. abm5378 produced folate but in lower concentrations. both endogenous and added microbes contribute to folate enhancement. selection of microbes with folate producing capability and limited hydrolytic activity will enable the development of products rich in folate and beta-glucan.

TI  == [the influence of symbiotics in multi-organ failure: randomised trial].
AB  == background and objective: to assess whether the administration of symbiotic preparations in patients with multi-organ failure (mof) diminishes the evolution  of the failure, the inflammatory response generated, the colonization pattern and the intensive care unit (icu) infectious illness. patients and method: randomized and controlled trial. all patients with mof were included. neutropenia and acute  pancreatitis patients were excluded. a symbiotic (simbiotic drink) was administered via enteral feeding during the first 7 days. variables of interest were: sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) score evolution, systemic concentrations of lactate, fibrinogen and d-dimer; skin and mucosa colonization and infectious disease register. results: eighty-nine patients were included; 46  in the symbiotic group (sg) and 43 in the control group (cg). there were 68.5% males, with a median age of 69 years. there were no significant differences in the patients' fundamental characteristics (medical history, age, reason for admission, severity scores), nor in the length of icu stay or in mortality. comparing the sg with the cg, there were lower lactate levels on the second day,  more fibrinogen levels on the days 5 and 7, and lower d-dimer levels on the day 7. eight hundred and ninety-five cultures were performed for colonization assessment, with isolation of 528 microorganisms. no differences in microbiological resistance were found; there were more colonization in the sg by  candida in mucous membranes after the third day; this situation resolved after stopping symbiotic administration. twenty-two patients suffered an infectious disease in icu, 14 in sg (42.4%) and 19 in cg (57.6%). although no differences were found in the microbiological pattern, there was a predominance of candida spp. over other microorganisms (4 vs. 0 cases). conclusions: the symbiotic preparation simbiotic drink, administered in mof, results in differences to improve the early lactate levels and late fibrinogen/d-dimer levels as well as mucosa colonization by candida. there were no differences in the icu evolution.

TI  == reduction of the off-flavor volatile generated by the yogurt starter culture including streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in soymilk.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus establish a symbiotic relationship in milk; however, s. thermophilus predominantly grows in soymilk. this study determined that excess diacetyl was notably generated mainly by s. thermophilus in soymilk, and this flavor compound  created an unpleasant odor in fermented soymilk. the addition of l-valine to soymilk reduced the amount of diacetyl and increased the levels of acetoin during fermentation by s. thermophilus . in addition, it was found that the expression of the ilvc gene was repressed and that of the als and aldb genes was stimulated  in s. thermophilus by l-valine. sensory evaluations with the triangle difference  test and a preference test showed that the soymilk fermented with l-valine was significantly preferred compared with that without l-valine. in this study, we successfully controlled the metabolic flux of s. thermophilus in soymilk and produced more favorable fermented soymilk without the use of genetically modified lactic acid bacteria strains.

TI  == short communication: survival of the characteristic microbiota in probiotic fermented camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks during refrigerated storage.
AB  == the objective of this study was to monitor the viability during storage of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in probiotic cultured dairy foods made from pasteurized camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks fermented by an abt-type culture. the products manufactured were stored at 4 degrees c for 42d. microbiological analyses were performed at weekly intervals. streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 was the most numerous culture component in all 4 products both at the beginning and at the end of storage. the viable counts of streptococci showed no significant decline in fermented camel milk throughout the entire storage period. the initial numbers of lb. acidophilus la-5 were over 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of strep. thermophilus chcc 742/2130. with the progress of time, a slow and constant decrease was observed in lactobacilli counts; however, the final viability percentages of this organism did not differ  significantly in the probiotic fermented milks tested. the cultured dairy foods made from cow, sheep, and goat milks had comparable b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 counts on d 0, exceeding by approximately 0.5 log10 cycle those in the camel milk-based product. no significant losses occurred in viability of bifidobacteria in fermented camel, cow, and sheep milks during 6wk of refrigerated storage. in conclusion, all 4 varieties of milk proved to be suitable raw materials for the manufacture of abt-type fermented dairy products that were microbiologically safe and beneficial for human consumption. it was suggested that milk from small ruminants be increasingly used to produce probiotic fermented dairy foods. the development of camel milk-based probiotic cultured milks appears to be even more  promising because new markets could thus be conquered. it must be emphasized, however, that further microbiological and sensory studies, technology development activities, and market research are needed before such food products can be successfully commercialized.

TI  == current taxonomy of phages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == phages infecting lactic acid bacteria have been the focus of significant research attention over the past three decades. through the isolation and characterization of hundreds of phage isolates, it has been possible to classify phages of the dairy starter and adjunct bacteria lactococus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, leuconostoc spp., and lactobacillus spp. among these, phages of l. lactis have been most thoroughly scrutinized and serve as an excellent model system to address issues that arise when attempting taxonomic classification of phages infecting other lab species. here, we present an overview of the current taxonomy of phages infecting lab genera of industrial significance, the methods employed in these taxonomic efforts and how these may be employed for the taxonomy of phages of currently underrepresented and emerging phage species.

TI  == petit suisse from black soybean: bioactive compounds and antioxidant properties during development process.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant properties, bioactive compounds and  other physico-chemical parameters from black soybean and its derivatives over 30  days under refrigeration at 4 degrees c and develop a probiotic petit suisse produced from black soybean. the soymilk showed the highest levels of isoflavones (109 mg/100 g), total phenolics (600 mg/100 g) and total anthocyanins (388 mg/100 g) with the highest response in the tests with dpph* and abts+* on a dry basis. there was a significant increase (p </= 0.05) in antioxidant activity during storage due to the hydrolysis of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones in soymilk sample, having a strong linear correlation between the concentration of isoflavone aglycones and the antioxidant activity for abts+* (r = 0.9437, 0.9624  and 0.9992) and dpph* (r = 0.9865, 0.9978 and 0.9911), respectively, for soymilk, quark and petit suisse. the conversion of isoflavone was influenced directly by the characteristics of each sample, inhibiting or promoting the action of the enzyme. the petit suisse developed is an alternative for consumers, providing isoflavones and anthocyanins, possessing probiotic average counts (10(8) cfu g(-)(1)) during storage.

TI  == optimisation of oat milk formulation to obtain fermented derivatives by using probiotic lactobacillus reuteri microorganisms.
AB  == functional advantages of probiotics combined with interesting composition of oat  were considered as an alternative to dairy products. in this study, fermentation  of oat milk with lactobacillus reuteri and streptococcus thermophilus was analysed to develop a new probiotic product. central composite design with response surface methodology was used to analyse the effect of different factors  (glucose, fructose, inulin and starters) on the probiotic population in the product. optimised formulation was characterised throughout storage time at 4 in  terms of ph, acidity, beta-glucan and oligosaccharides contents, colour and rheological behaviour. all formulations studied were adequate to produce fermented foods and minimum dose of each factor was considered as optimum. the selected formulation allowed starters survival above 10(7)/cfu ml to be considered as a functional food and was maintained during the 28 days controlled. beta-glucans remained in the final product with a positive effect on viscosity. therefore, a new probiotic non-dairy milk was successfully developed in which high probiotic survivals were assured throughout the typical yoghurt-like shelf life.

TI  == microbial biodiversity in cheese consortia and comparative listeria growth on surfaces of uncooked pressed cheeses.
AB  == the study set out to determine how changes in the microbial diversity of a complex antilisterial consortium from the surface of st-nectaire cheese modify its antilisterial activities. on the basis of the microbial composition of a natural complex consortium named tr15 (truefood consortium 15), three new consortia of different species and strain compositions were defined: tr15-sc (58  isolates from tr15 collection), tr15-m (pools of isolates from selective counting media) and tr15-bhi (pools of isolates from bhi medium). their antilisterial activities on the surfaces of uncooked pressed cheese made with pasteurised milk  were compared with the activity of complex consortium tr15 and a control cheese inoculated only with starter culture (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii). the natural consortium tr15 was the most inhibitory, followed by reconstituted consortium tr15-bhi. the dynamics of the cheese rind microbial flora were monitored by counting on media and by isolate identification using 16s rdna sequencing and direct 16s rdna single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. the combination of these methods showed that rind with natural consortium tr15 had greater microbial diversity and different microbial dynamics  than cheese rinds with reconstituted consortia. cheese rind with the natural consortium showed higher citrate consumption and the highest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids, connected with high levels of lactic acid bacteria such  as carnobacterium maltaromaticum, vagococcus fluvialis, enterococcus gilvus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, brochothrix thermosphacta and lactococcus lactis, ripening bacteria such as arthrobacter nicotianae/arilaitensis, and gram negative bacteria (pseudomonas psychrophila and enterobacter spp.). the highest l. monocytogenes count was on rind with tr15-m and was positively associated with the highest ph value, high succinic and citric acid contents, and the highest levels of marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans and gram positive catalase positive bacteria represented by staphylococcus vitulinus, brevibacterium linens, microbacterium gubbeenense and brachybacterium tyrofermentans. the results show that the species composition of consortium is more important than the number of species. it is likely that inhibition mechanisms differ from one consortium to another; investigating gene expression will be an effective way to elucidate microbial interactions in cheese.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

AB  == many commercial sanitizers and disinfectants have been used over the years to control microbial contamination but their efficacy on phages is often unknown. here, 23 commercial chemical products, including 21 food-grade sanitizers were tested against virulent dairy phages. these food-grade chemicals included oxidizing agents, halogenated agents, alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds, anionic acids, iodine-based acids, and an amphoteric chemical. phage p008 was first exposed to each sanitizer for 2 and 15min at room temperature and at two different concentrations, namely the lowest and highest no-rinse sanitizing concentrations. organic matter (whey or milk) was also added to the testing solutions. at the end of the exposure period, the test solution was neutralized and the number of infectious phages was determined by plaque assays. the five most efficient sanitizers against phage p008 (<4 log of inactivation) were then tested against virulent lactococcal phages p008, cb13, af6, p1532 of the 936 group, p001 (c2), q54, and 1358 as well as lactobacillus plantarum phage b1 and streptococcus thermophilus phage 2972 using the same protocol. the oxidizing agents and the quaternary ammonium compounds were the most efficient against all  phages although phages cb13 and p1532 were less sensitive to these chemicals than the other phages. this study may help in the selection of appropriate chemicals for controlling phage contamination in industrial factories and research laboratories.

TI  == food environments select microorganisms based on selfish energetic behavior.
AB  == nutrient richness, and specifically the abundance of mono- and disaccharides that characterize several food matrixes, such as milk and grape juice, has allowed the speciation of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts with a high fermentation capacity instead of energetically favorable respiratory metabolism. in these environmental contexts, rapid sugar consumption and lactic acid or ethanol production, accumulation, and tolerance, together with the ability to propagate in the absence of oxygen, are several of the "winning" traits that have apparently evolved and become specialized to perfection in these fermenting microorganisms.  here, we summarize and discuss the evolutionary context that has driven energetic metabolism in food-associated microorganisms, using the dairy species lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus among prokaryotes and the bakers' yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae among eukaryotes as model organisms.

TI  == microbiological, physico-chemical, nutritional and sensory characterization of traditional matsoni: selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures  to extend its shelf-life.
AB  == matsoni, a traditional georgian fermented milk, has variable quality and stability besides a short shelf-life (72-120 h at 6 degrees c) due to inadequate  production and storage conditions. to individuate its typical traits as well as select and exploit autochthonous starter cultures to standardize its overall quality without altering its typicality, we carried out a thorough physico-chemical, sensorial and microbial characterization of traditional matsoni. a polyphasic approach, including a culture-independent (pcr-dgge) and two pcr culture-dependent methods, was employed to study the ecology of matsoni.  overall, the microbial ecosystem of matsoni resulted largely dominated by streptococcus (s.) thermophilus and lactobacillus (lb.) delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. high loads of other lactic acid bacteria species, including lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei and leuconostoc (leuc.) lactis were found to occur as well. a selected autochthonous multiple strain culture (amsc) composed of one lb. bulgaricus, one lb. paracasei and one s. thermophilus strain, applied for the pilot-scale production of traditional matsoni, resulted the best in terms of enhanced shelf-life (one month), sensorial and nutritional quality without altering its overall typical quality. this amsc is at disposal of smes who need to exploit and standardize the overall quality of this traditional fermented milk, preserving its typicality.

TI  == adaptation of the haloarcula hispanica crispr-cas system to a purified virus strictly requires a priming process.
AB  == the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (crispr)-cas system  mediates adaptive immunity against foreign nucleic acids in prokaryotes. however, efficient adaptation of a native crispr to purified viruses has only been observed for the type ii-a system from a streptococcus thermophilus industry strain, and rarely reported for laboratory strains. here, we provide a second native system showing efficient adaptation. infected by a newly isolated virus hhpv-2, haloarcula hispanica type i-b crispr system acquired spacers discriminatively from viral sequences. unexpectedly, in addition to cas1, cas2 and cas4, this process also requires cas3 and at least partial cascade proteins,  which are involved in interference and/or crispr rna maturation. intriguingly, a  preexisting spacer partially matching a viral sequence is also required, and spacer acquisition from upstream and downstream sequences of its target sequence  (i.e. priming protospacer) shows different strand bias. these evidences strongly  indicate that adaptation in this system strictly requires a priming process. this requirement, if validated also true for other crispr systems as implied by our bioinformatic analysis, may help to explain failures to observe efficient adaptation to purified viruses in many laboratory strains, and the discrimination mechanism at the adaptation level that has confused scientists for years.

AB  == the ternary cas9-crrna-tracrrna complex (cas9t) of the type ii crispr (clustered  regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-cas (crispr-associated) system functions as an mg2+-dependent rna-directed dna endonuclease that locates its dna target guided by the crrna (crispr rna) in the tracrrna-crrna structure and introduces a double-strand break at a specific site in dna. the simple modular organization of cas9t, where specificity for the dna target is encoded by a small crrna and the cleavage reaction is executed by the cas9 endonuclease, provides a  versatile platform for the engineering of universal rna-directed dna endonucleases. by altering the crrna sequence within the cas9t complex, programmable endonucleases can be designed for both in vitro and in vivo applications. cas9t has been recently employed as a gene-editing tool in various  eukaryotic cell types. using streptococcus thermophilus cas9t as a model system,  we demonstrate the feasibility of cas9t as a programmable molecular tool for in vitro dna manipulations.

TI  == genomic impact of crispr immunization against bacteriophages.
AB  == crispr (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) together with  cas (rispr-associated) genes form the crispr-cas immune system, which provides sequence-specific adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements in bacteria  and archaea. immunity is acquired by the integration of short stretches of invasive dna as novel 'spacers' into crispr loci. subsequently, these immune markers are transcribed and generate small non-coding interfering rnas that specifically guide nucleases for sequence-specific cleavage of complementary sequences. among the four crispr-cas systems present in streptococcus thermophilus, crispr1 and crispr3 have the ability to readily acquire new spacers following bacteriophage or plasmid exposure. in order to investigate the impact of building crispr-encoded immunity on the host chromosome, we determined the genome sequence of a bim (bacteriophage-insensitive mutant) derived from the dgcc7710 model organism, after four consecutive rounds of bacteriophage challenge. as expected, active crispr loci evolved via polarized addition of several novel spacers following exposure to bacteriophages. although analysis of  the draft genome sequence revealed a variety of snps (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and indels (insertions/deletions), most of the in silico differences were not validated by sanger re-sequencing. in addition, two snps and two small indels were identified and tracked in the intermediate variants. overall, building crispr-encoded immunity does not significantly affect the genome, which allows the maintenance of important functional properties in isogenic crispr mutants. this is critical for the development and formulation of  sustainable and robust next-generation starter cultures with increased industrial lifespans.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic survivability in yogurt exposed to cold chain interruption.
AB  == in this research, the survival of probiotic microorganisms in yogurts stored at room temperature (cold chain interruption conditions) was studied. milk inoculated with yogurt bacteria (mixed culture of streptococcus thermophilus and  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) and a single probiotic culture (l. acidophilus la-5 or bifidobacterium lactis bb- 12 or l. rhamnosus hn001 or l. paracasei lpc-37) were incubated till ph of 4.5 was reached. probiotic yogurts were stored at two different temperatures including cold (control) and room temperatures (5 and 20 degrees c, respectively). changes in ph decrease, titratable acidity increase and redox potential increase as well as the viability of probiotics per 6 h intervals during an assumptive interrupted cold storage (24 h) were monitored. the survival of probiotics was strongly dependent on the storage temperature and remarkable viability loss occurred in room temperature compared to refrigerated storage. in addition, the survivability was dependent on probiotic strain. among our experimental strains, b. lactis bb-12 showed the less resistance to be stored at 20 degrees c (24 h) and referring to the recommended minimum numbers of 10(7) cfu ml(-) (1), l. rhamnosus hn001 was the most suitable  probiotic strain to be used in probiotic yogurts especially in countries having high possibility of cold chain interruption during storage.

TI  == probiotic effects on late-onset sepsis in very preterm infants: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == background and objective: late-onset sepsis frequently complicates prematurity, contributing to morbidity and mortality. probiotics may reduce mortality and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in preterm infants, with unclear effect on late-onset sepsis. this study aimed to determine the effect of administering a specific combination of probiotics to very preterm infants on culture-proven late-onset sepsis. methods: a prospective multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial compared daily administration of a probiotic combination (bifidobacterium infantis, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium lactis, containing 1 x 10(9) total organisms) with placebo (maltodextrin) in infants born before 32 completed weeks' gestation weighing <1500 g. the primary outcome was at least 1 episode of definite late-onset sepsis. results: between october 2007 and november 2011, 1099 very preterm infants from australia and new zealand were randomized. rates of definite late-onset sepsis (16.2%), nec of bell stage 2 or more (4.4%), and mortality (5.1%) were low in controls, with high breast milk feeding rates (96.9%). no significant difference in definite late-onset sepsis or all-cause mortality was found, but this probiotic combination reduced nec of bell stage 2 or more (2.0% versus 4.4%; relative risk 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.93, p = .03; number needed to treat 43, 95% confidence interval 23 to 333). conclusions: the probiotics b infantis, s thermophilus, and b lactis significantly reduced nec of  bell stage 2 or more in very preterm infants, but not definite late-onset sepsis  or mortality. treatment with this combination of probiotics appears to be safe.

TI  == genetically engineered immunomodulatory streptococcus thermophilus strains producing antioxidant enzymes exhibit enhanced anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == the aims of this study were to develop strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) having both immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties and to evaluate their anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro, in different cellular models, and in vivo, in a mouse model of colitis. different lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus strains were cocultured with primary cultures of mononuclear cells. analysis of the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by these cells after coincubation with candidate bacteria revealed that l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 864 and s. thermophilus crl 807 display the highest anti-inflammatory profiles in vitro. moreover, these results were confirmed in vivo by the determination of the cytokine profiles in large intestine samples of mice fed with these strains. s. thermophilus crl 807 was then transformed with two different plasmids harboring the genes encoding catalase (cat) or superoxide dismutase (sod) antioxidant enzymes, and the anti-inflammatory effects of recombinant streptococci were evaluated in a mouse model of colitis induced by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (tnbs). our results showed a decrease in weight loss, lower liver microbial translocation, lower macroscopic and microscopic damage scores, and modulation of the cytokine production in the large intestines of mice treated with either cat- or sod-producing streptococci compared to those in mice treated with the wild-type strain or control mice without any treatment. furthermore, the greatest anti-inflammatory activity was observed in mice receiving a mixture of both cat-  and sod-producing streptococci. the addition of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus  crl 864 to this mixture did not improve their beneficial effects. these findings  show that genetically engineering a candidate bacterium (e.g., s. thermophilus crl 807) with intrinsic immunomodulatory properties by introducing a gene expressing an antioxidant enzyme enhances its anti-inflammatory activities.

TI  == use of microparticulated whey protein concentrate, exopolysaccharide-producing streptococcus thermophilus, and adjunct cultures for making low-fat italian caciotta-type cheese.
AB  == low-fat caciotta-type cheeses were manufactured with partially skim milk (fat content of ~0.3%) alone (lfc); with the supplementation of 0.5% (wt/vol) microparticulated whey protein concentrate (mwpc) (lfc-mwpc); with mwpc and exopolysaccharides (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus st446 (lfc-mwpc-eps); and with mwpc, eps-producing strain st446, and lactobacillus plantarum lp and lactobacillus rhamnosus lra as adjunct cultures (lfc-mwpc-eps-a). the non-eps-producing isogenic variant streptococcus thermophilus st042 was used for making full-fat caciotta-type cheese (ffc), lfc,  and lfc-mwpc. cheeses were characterized based on compositional, microbiological, biochemical, texture, volatile components (purge and trap, and solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), and sensory analyses. compared with ffc and lfc (51.6 +/- 0.7 to 53.0 +/- 0.9%), the other cheese variants retained higher levels of moisture (60.5 +/- 1.1 to 67.5 +/- 0.5%). the mwpc mainly contributed to moisture retention. overall, all lfc had approximately one-fourth (22.6 +/- 0.8%) of the fat of ffc. hardness of cheeses slightly varied over 7d of ripening. microbial eps positively affected cheese texture, and the texture of lfc without mwpc or microbial eps was excessively firm. free amino acids were at the highest levels in lfc treatments (2,705.8 +/-  122 to 3,070.4 +/- 123 mg/kg) due to the addition of mwpc and the peptidase activity of adjunct cultures. aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, sulfur compounds, and short- to medium-chain carboxylic acids differentiated lfc variants and ffc. the  sensory attributes pleasant to taste, intensity of flavor, overall acceptability, and pleasant to chew variously described lfc-mwpc-eps and lfc-mwpc-eps-a. based on the technology options used, low-fat caciotta-type cheese (especially ripened  for 14 d) has promising features to be further exploited as a suitable alternative to the full-fat variant.

TI  == viability of probiotic lactobacillus casei in yoghurt: defining the best processing step to its addition.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms capable of producing beneficial effects on its host when consumed in adequate amounts. to exert these effects, foods must contain probiotic microorganisms in populations above 10(6) cfu/g or ml throughout its shelf life. one of the strategies to ensure high population of probiotics in fermented milk is to add them during or after the fermentation process separately from the starter cultures. the objective of this study was to  investigate the behavior of the probiotic microorganism lactobacillus casei added to yoghurt in different stages of production. yoghurts with l. casei were produced at different stages: before addition of starter (streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus),  added together with this culture and at the end of fermentation. yoghurt without  probiotic added was produced as a control. the products were stored at 4 degrees  c and analyzed after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage. in these periods, the populations ofprobiotic and starter cultures were enumerated and the parameters ph and acidity were analyzed. the results were evaluated using analysis of variance and tukey's test, both at 5% significance level. l. casei remained viable in populations of more than 10(8) cfu / g during 21 days of storage, which is suitable to define the formulations as probiotics. when the different stages of the addition of probiotics in yoghurts were evaluated there was no statistical difference between the formulations (p < 0.05) for populations of l. casei except for the first day of storage.

AB  == background: this study aimed to investigate the mechanism of the probiotic vsl#3  in acute alcoholic intestinal injury, and evaluate the effect of vsl#3, glutamine,vsl#3+glutamine and heat-killed vsl#3 therapy in a rat model. methods:  six- to eight-week-old male wild-type rats were divided into seven groups. to establish the acute alcohol liver disease model, rats received three doses of corn starch dissolved in pbs/40% alcohol administered intra-gastrically every 12  hours. treatment groups received an intra-gastric dose of vsl#3, glutamine, heat-killed vsl#3, or vsl#3+glutamine 30 minutes prior to alcohol administration. the placebo group was treated with pbs prior to alcohol administration. tnfalpha  and endotoxin in plasma was measured by elisa and tachypleus ameboctye lysate assays, and electron microscopy, western blotting, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to identify the mechanisms of vsl#3 in the regulation of epithelial permeability. results: first, compared with control group, endotoxin and tnfalpha in alcohol group was obviously high. at the same time, in vsl#3 group,the expression of endotoxin and tnfalpha obviously lower than the alcohol group. and the trends of the expression of tight junction proteins in these groups were reversed with the change of endotoxin and tnfalpha. second, compared the groups of vsl#3 with glutamine,vsl#3+glutamine and heat-killed vsl#3,we found that both vsl#3 and heat-killed vsl#3, glutamine were  as effective as vsl#3+glutamine in the treatment of acute alcohol liver disease,  the expression of endotoxin and tnfalpha were lower than the alcohol group, and tight junction proteins were higher than the alcohol group whereas the expression of tight junction proteins were higher in vsl#3 + glutamine group than either agent alone, but have no significant difference. conclusion: we conclude that vsl#3 treatment can regulate the ecological balance of the gut microflora, preventing passage of endotoxin and other bacterial products from the gut lumen into the portal circulation and down-regulating the expression of tnfalpha, which could otherwise down-regulate the expression of tight junction proteins and increase epithelial permeability.

TI  == prevalence and comparison of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus in raw and fermented dairy products from east and west africa.
AB  == streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus are members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) associated with human infections. sbsec-related endocarditis was  furthermore associated with rural residency in southern europe. sbsec members are increasingly isolated as predominant species from fermented dairy products in europe, asia and africa. african variants of sii displayed dairy adaptations to lactose metabolism paralleling those of streptococcus thermophilus including genome decay. in this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of sii and possibly other sbsec members in dairy products of east and west africa in order to identify their habitat, estimate their importance in dairy fermentation processes and determine geographic areas affected by this potential health risk.  presumptive sbsec members were isolated on semi-selective m17 and sm agar media.  subsequent genotypic identification of isolates was based on rep-pcr fingerprinting and sbsec-specific16s rrna gene pcr assay. detailed identification was achieved through application of novel primers enhancing the binding stringency in partial groes/groel gene amplification and subsequent dna sequencing. the presence of s. thermophilus-like lacs and lacz genes in the sbsec isolates was determined to elucidate the prevalence of this dairy adaptation. isolates (n = 754) were obtained from 72 raw and 95 fermented milk samples from cote d'ivoire and kenya on semi-selective agar media. colonies of sii were not detected from raw milk despite high microbial titers of approximately 10(6)cfu/ml on m17 agar medium. however, after spontaneous milk fermentation sii was genotypically identified in 94.1% of kenyan samples and 60.8% of kenyan isolates. sii prevalence in cote d'ivoire displayed seasonal variations in samples from 32.3% (june) to 40.0% (dec/jan) and isolates from 20.5% (june) to 27.7% (dec/jan) present at titers of 10(6)-10(8)cfu/ml. lacs and lacz genes were detected in all  kenyan and 25.8% (june) to 65.4% (dec/jan) of ivorian sii isolates. regional differences in prevalence of sii and dairy adaptations were observed, but no clear effect of dairy animal, fermentation procedure and climate was revealed. conclusively, the high prevalence of sii in kenya, cote d'ivoire in addition to somalia, sudan and mali strongly indicates a pivotal role of sii in traditional african dairy fermentations potentially paralleling that of typical western dairy species s. thermophilus. putative health risks associated with the consumption of high amounts of live sii and potential different degrees of evolutionary adaptation or ecological colonization require further epidemiologic and genomic investigations, particularly in africa.

TI  == influence of casein hydrolysates on exopolysaccharide synthesis by streptococcus  thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.
AB  == background: a lot of interesting research has been undertaken to enhance the yield of exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab). the objective of this study was to determine the influence of casein hydrolysates (ch) with molecular weight less than 3 kda on cell viability, eps synthesis and the enzyme activity involved in eps synthesis during the co-culturing of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in mrs broth for 72 h at 37 +/- 0.1 degrees c. results: the highest eps yield (150.1 mg  l(-)(1)) was obtained on ch prepared with papain (chp) at 48 h. at 24 h, eps were composed of galactose, glucose and rhamnose in a molar ratio of 1.0:2.4:1.5. the  monosaccharide composition changed with extension of the fermentation time. the activities of alpha-phosphoglucomutase, uridine 5'-diphosphate (udp)-glucose pyrophosphorylase and udp-galactose 4-epimerase were associated with eps synthesis. moreover, the activities of beta-phosphoglucomutase and deoxythymadine 5'-diphosphate (dtdp)-glucose pyrophosphorylase involved in rhamnose synthesis were very low at the exponential growth phase and could not be detected during other given periods. conclusion: the influence of different ch (<3 kda) on lab viability, eps production, eps monomeric composition and activity levels of key metabolic enzymes was distinct. besides, their influence was related to the distribution of amino acids.

TI  == hydrolysis of milk-derived bioactive peptides by cell-associated extracellular peptidases of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the trend to confer new functional properties to fermented dairy products by supplementation with bioactive peptides is growing in order to encounter the challenge of health-promoting foods. but these functional ingredients have not to be hydrolysed by proteases of bacteria used in the manufacture of these products. one of the two yoghurt bacteria, streptococcus thermophilus, has long been considered as weakly proteolytic since its only cell wall-associated subtilisin-like protease, called prts, is not always present. nevertheless, a recent study pointed out a possible peptidase activity in certain strains. in this present study, the stability of milk-derived bioactive peptides, e.g. the anxiolytic peptide, alphas1-cn-(f91-97), in the presence of two different s. thermophilus strains with prts+ or prts- phenotype was studied. both strains appeared to be capable of hydrolysing the alphas1-cn-(f91-97) and other bioactive peptides by recurrent removal of n-terminal residues. the hydrolysis was neither  due to intracellular peptidases nor to htra protease. results obtained showed that the observed activity originates from the presence at the surface of both strains of an extracellular aminopeptidase activity. moreover, a cell wall-associated x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase activity was also highlighted when  beta-casomorphin-7 was used as substrate. all of these findings suggest that, in  order to use fermented milks as vector of bioactive peptides, the stability of these bioactive peptides in this kind of products implies to carefully characterize the potential action of the surface proteolytic enzymes of s. thermophilus.

AB  == protein interactions are essential elements for the biological machineries underlying biochemical and physiological mechanisms indispensable for microorganism life. by using mono-dimensional blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1d-bn-page), two-dimensional blue native/urea-page (2d-bn/urea-page) and two-dimensional blue native/sds-page (2d-bn/sds-page), membrane protein complexes of streptococcus thermophilus were resolved and visualized. protein complex and oligomer constituents were then identified by nlc-esi-lit-ms/ms. in total, 65 heteromeric and 30 homomeric complexes were observed, which were then associated with 110 non-redundant bacterial proteins. protein machineries involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, molecular uptake, energy metabolism, cell division, protein secretion, folding and chaperone activities were highly represented in electrophoretic profiles; a number of homomeric moonlighting proteins were also identified. information on hypothetical proteins was also derived. parallel genome sequencing unveiled that the genes coding for the enzymes involved in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis derive from two separate clusters, generally showing high variability between bacterial strains,  which contribute to a unique, synchronized and active synthetic module. the approach reported here paves the way for a further functional characterization of these protein complexes and will facilitate future studies on their assembly and  composition during various growth conditions and in different mutant backgrounds, with important consequences for biotechnological applications of this bacterium in dairy productions. biological significance: combined proteomic procedures have been applied to the characterization of heteromultimeric and homomeric protein complexes from the membrane fraction of s. thermophilus. protein machineries involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, molecular uptake, energy metabolism, cell division, protein secretion, folding and chaperone activities were identified; information on hypothetical and moonlighting proteins were also derived. this study is original in the lactic bacteria context and may be considered as preliminary to a deeper functional characterization of the corresponding protein complexes. due to the large use of s. thermophilus as a starter for dairy productions, the data reported here may facilitate future investigations on protein complex assembly and composition under different experimental conditions or for bacterial strains having specific biotechnological applications.

TI  == effect of prebiotic carbohydrates on growth, bile survival and cholesterol uptake abilities of dairy-related bacteria.
AB  == background: three strains of lactic acid bacteria and one probiotic bifidobacterium strain sourced from milk origin were considered to select for the best synbiotic-like combination for cholesterol uptake ability. for that purpose, fermentative characteristics, bile salt hydrolase activity, bile survival and cholesterol removal were assessed in the presence of different carbohydrates. results: carbohydrate fermentability was highly variable among the different strains, and lactulose was the only prebiotic to favour growth of all strains, whereas pectin led to low population regardless of the strain. bile survival of bacteria could be improved by the preferred carbon source and was related to their bile salt hydrolase activities. all together, our results showed that the most advantageous synbiotic-like combinations to achieve cholesterol uptake abilities were lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lb 340 with raffinose, streptococcus thermophilus ta040 or lactobacillus rhamnosus lbre-lsas with lactulose, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12 with mannitol. conclusion: the suggested synbiotics may represent new promising functional dairy additives.

TI  == utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  == human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are not digested in the proximal intestine. in distal intestine, hmos collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the hmos is not well defined. here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated hmos in anaerobic culture. this allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific hmos on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. most bifidobacteria spp. and bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-l-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (scfas) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl), 3-fl, and lactodifucotetraose (ldft). lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258 exhibited slight growth, ph reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-fl or 3-fl, but not ldft. supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-sl) and 6'-sl promoted moderate growth of bifidobacterium longum jcm7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, atcc15708, bacteroides vulgatus atcc8482, and b. thetaiotaomicron atcc29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, scfa, or both. lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830 also consumed 6'-sl. in contrast, clostridium spp., l. rhamnosus atcc53103, e. faecalis atcc29200, staphylococcus spp., enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli k12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. specific bifidobacteria and bacteroides differentially digest specific individual hmos, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. this suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.

AB  == carnobacterium maltaromaticum is a lactic acid bacterium isolated from soft cheese. the objective of this work was to study its potential positive impact when used in cheese technology. phenotypic and genotypic characterization of six  strains of c. maltaromaticum showed that they belong to different phylogenetic groups. although these strains lacked the ability to coagulate milk quickly, they were acidotolerant. they did not affect the coagulation capacity of starter lactic acid bacteria, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus, used in  dairy industry. the impact of c. maltaromaticum lma 28 on bacterial flora of cheese revealed a significant decrease of psychrobacter sp. concentration, which  might be responsible for cheese aging phenomena. an experimental plan was carried out to unravel the mechanism of inhibition of psychrobacter sp. and listeria monocytogenes and possible interaction between various factors (cell concentration, nacl, ph and incubation time). cellular concentration of c. maltaromaticum lma 28 was found to be the main factor involved in the inhibition  of psychrobacter sp. and l. monocytogenes.

TI  == effects of polysaccharide isolated from streptococcus thermophilus crl1190 on human gastric epithelial cells.
AB  == eps1190 was isolated from skim milk fermented with stretococcus thermophilus crl1190. the polysaccharide consisted of 33% glucose and 66% galactose with 1,4-  and 1,4,6-galactose residues as main building blocks beside a high amount of 1,4-linked glucose. the polymer was characterized additionally concerning viscosity and zeta potential. eps1190 stimulated cellular vitality and proliferation of human stomach ags cells and human buccal kb cells significantly. eps1190 stimulated phagocytosis rate of murine macrophages raw264.7 significantly. no-release or anti-inflammatory effects by inhibition of lps-induced no release were not observed. confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that eps1190 is partially internalized into ags cells via endosomes. the bioadhesive absorption of fitc-labeled eps1190 into the mucus layer on the apical side of the epithelium using histological tissue sections from human stomach was  observed. specific interaction of eps1190 with mucin can be excluded as shown by  microviscosimetry studies. eps1190 increased the adhesion of h. pylori to ags cells, which resulted in increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines tnfa, il-6 and il-8. summarizing, eps1190 seems to stimulate epithelial cell regeneration and immunological innate defense mechanisms, which again can rationalized the use of this polysaccharide as cytoprotective compound in probiotioc preparations.

TI  == the thioredoxin system in the dental caries pathogen streptococcus mutans and the food-industry bacterium streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the streptococcus genus includes the pathogenic species streptococcus mutans, the main responsible of dental caries, and the safe microorganism streptococcus thermophilus, used for the manufacture of dairy products. these facultative anaerobes control the levels of reactive oxygen species (ros) and indeed, both s. mutans and s. thermophilus possess a cambialistic superoxide dismutase, the key enzyme for a preventive action against ros. to evaluate the properties of a crucial mechanism for repairing ros damages, the molecular and functional characterization of the thioredoxin system in these streptococci was investigated. the putative genes encoding its protein components in s. mutans and s. thermophilus were analysed and the corresponding recombinant proteins were purified. a single thioredoxin reductase was obtained from either s. mutans (smtrxb) or s. thermophilus (sttrxb1), whereas two thioredoxins were prepared from either s. mutans (smtrxa and smtrxh1) or s. thermophilus (sttrxa1 and sttrxa2). both smtrxb and sttrxb1 reduced the synthetic substrate dtnb in the presence of nadph, whereas only smtrxa and sttrxa1 accelerated the insulin reduction in the presence of dtt. to reconstitute an in vitro streptococcal thioredoxin system, the combined activity of the thioredoxin components was tested through the insulin precipitation in the absence of dtt. the assay functions with a combination of smtrxb or sttrxb1 with either smtrxa or sttrxa1.  these results suggest that the streptococcal members of the thioredoxin system display a direct functional interaction between them and that these protein components are interchangeable within the streptococcus genus. in conclusion, our data prove the existence of a functioning thioredoxin system even in these microaerophiles.

TI  == efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of candida-associated stomatitis.
AB  == this study aimed at evaluating the short-term efficacy and safety of probiotics as an aid in the treatment of candida-associated stomatitis in a randomised controlled trial. a total of 65 patients were randomly assigned to receive oral local antifungal agents alone (gargle 2% sodium bicarbonate solution for 30 s, wait 10 min and then apply 2% nystatin paste) or these agents plus local probiotics (the mixture of bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) three times per day for 4 weeks. parameters related to hyperaemia, visual analogue scale scores, culture of resting saliva and a lingual dorsum swab and adverse reactions were assessed or recorded in the beginning, middle and end of treatment. although the baseline characteristics of  the participants were similar, both groups showed a significant reduction in pain level and hyperaemia on the tongue mucosa (p = 0.000) after 4-week application. however, despite the reduction in hyperaemia in the probiotic group, these improvements did not display statistically significant differences. the detection rate of candida spp. was 100% before treatment and 8.21% in the experimental group and 34.6% in the control group after treatment. the detection rate of candida spp. decreased (p = 0.000) in both groups and was significantly lower in  the probiotic group than the control group (p = 0.038). other analysed micro-organisms, including the decreased detection rate for lactobacillus spp. (p = 0.049) and the increased detection rate for staphylococcus epidermidis (p = 0.019), did not display consistent change trends in the probiotics group. compared with conventional antifungal therapies for oral candidiasis, the inclusion of locally administered probiotics helped improve certain clinical conditions and reduced the prevalence of candida spp., although the impact of probiotics on oral bacterial species remains to be further studied.

TI  == efficient genome engineering in human pluripotent stem cells using cas9 from neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == genome engineering in human pluripotent stem cells (hpscs) holds great promise for biomedical research and regenerative medicine. recently, an rna-guided, dna-cleaving interference pathway from bacteria [the type ii clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (crispr)-crispr-associated (cas) pathway]  has been adapted for use in eukaryotic cells, greatly facilitating genome editing. only two crispr-cas systems (from streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus thermophilus), each with their own distinct targeting requirements  and limitations, have been developed for genome editing thus far. furthermore, limited information exists about homology-directed repair (hdr)-mediated gene targeting using long donor dna templates in hpscs with these systems. here, using a distinct crispr-cas system from neisseria meningitidis, we demonstrate efficient targeting of an endogenous gene in three hpsc lines using hdr. the cas9 rna-guided endonuclease from n. meningitidis (nmcas9) recognizes a 5'-nnnngatt-3' protospacer adjacent motif (pam) different from those recognized by cas9 proteins from s. pyogenes and s. thermophilus (spcas9 and stcas9, respectively). similar to spcas9, nmcas9 is able to use a single-guide rna (sgrna) to direct its activity. because of its distinct protospacer adjacent motif, the n. meningitidis crispr-cas machinery increases the sequence contexts amenable to rna-directed genome editing.

TI  == effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: we are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. objective: this study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. methods: this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. the multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) cfu), l. casei (7 x 10(9) cfu), l. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), l. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) cfu), bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) cfu), b. longum (7 x 10(9) cfu), streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (gsh). results: between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (fpg) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in fpg (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group  and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. we observed a significant increase in homa-ir (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). mean changes in serum hs-crp were significantly different between the two  groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group,  p = 0.02). probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma gsh  levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). conclusion:  in conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in fpg and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-crp and an increase in plasma total gsh.

TI  == acid induced gelation of soymilk, comparison between gels prepared with lactic acid bacteria and glucono-delta-lactone.
AB  == the objective of this work was to compare the gelation of soymilk particles induced by the acidification of a commercial starter culture with that resulting  by addition of glucono-delta-lactone (gdl). structure formation was followed using rheology, and the microstructure was observed by confocal microscopy. acidification of lactic acid bacteria resulted in a higher gelation ph (ph 6.29+/-0.05) compared to that of a gel induced by gdl (ph 5.9+/-0.04). this difference was attributed to the longer time available for rearrangements of the  soymilk particles in soymilk with starter cultures compared to the fast acidification by gdl. in spite of the earlier gelation ph, there were no observed differences in the final gel stiffness measured at ph 5.1, the value of tan delta, the frequency dependence and the linear viscoelastic range of the gels measured at the final ph. microstructural observations also showed a similar protein network structure.

TI  == probiotics for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates: an 8-year retrospective cohort study.
AB  == what is known and objective: probiotic therapy has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in premature infants in several  international studies using various probiotic agents. the purpose of this study(*) is to describe our experience of using probiotic therapy in preventing nec in infants with very low birth weight (vlbw) in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) and to evaluate whether our records provide evidence of effectiveness for probiotic therapy. methods: in a retrospective cohort study, the efficacy of  probiotic therapy in preventing nec in vlbw infants was investigated via chart review. a probiotic administration protocol using a three-strain (streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium infantis and bifidobacterium bifidum) supplement was implemented in august 2007. patients admitted to the nicu from august 2003 through july 2011 were screened. primary outcomes are the morbidity and mortality of nec. the secondary outcomes were severity of nec and incidence of where infant feeds were stopped but nec was not diagnosed (nec scare). results and discussion: there was a significant increased baseline risk of nec development in the probiotics group, including younger gestational age, higher incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (pda) and use of indomethacin. the incidence of nec is similar  between the control group (2.8%) and probiotics group (2.4%) (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.42, 3.12). mortality of nec is also not statistically different. incidence of nec scare was decreased from 2.8% in control group to 1.4% in probiotics group, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.38). what is known and conclusion: our findings  suggest that probiotics are safe in nec prevention in vlbw infants. we had no cases of infection related to the strains of bacteria used in our product. with the low incidence of nec (2.8%) and nec scare (2.8%) in our cohort, we do not have enough power to detect any change in outcome, particularly as our study was  observational. however, it is hoped that our data give useful information for others on probiotic prophylactic therapy in the routine clinical management of vlbw infants.

TI  == effects of streptococcus thermophilus th-4 in a rat model of doxorubicin-induced  mucositis.
AB  == background: mucositis is a debilitating intestinal side effect of chemotherapeutic regimens. probiotics have been considered a possible preventative treatment for mucositis. streptococcus thermophilus th-4 (th-4), a newly identified probiotic, has been shown to partially alleviate mucositis induced by administration of the antimetabolite chemotherapy drug, methotrexate in rats; likely mediated through a mechanism of folate production. however, its effects against other classes of chemotherapy drug have yet to be determined. aims: the authors investigated the effects of th-4 in a rat model of mucositis induced by the anthracycline chemotherapy drug, doxorubicin. methods: gastrointestinal damage was induced in female dark agouti rats (148.3 +/- 1.5 g)  by intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (20 mg/kg). animals recieved a daily  oral gavage of th-4 at 10(9) cfu/ml or skim milk (vehicle) from days 0 to 8. at day 6, rats were injected with either saline or doxorubicin. at kill, small intestinal tissues were collected for determination of sucrase and myeloperoxidase (mpo) activities and histological assessment. results: body weight was significantly decreased by doxorubicin compared with normal controls (p < 0.05). histological parameters, such as crypt depth and villus height, were  also significantly decreased by doxorubicin. th-4 partially prevented the loss of body weight induced by doxorubicin (2.3% compared with 4%), but provided no further therapeutic benefit. conclusions: the minimal amelioration of doxorubicin-induced mucositis by th-4 further supports folate production as a likely mechanism of th-4 action against methotrexate-induced mucositis. further studies into th-4 are required to confirm its applicability to other conventional chemotherapy regimens.

TI  == [effect of probiotics on the dynamics of gastrointestinal symptoms of food allergy to cow's milk protein in infants].
AB  == the problem of food allergy to cow's milk protein in children is highly important. the aim of this study was to estimate the effect of bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 (1small ha, cyrillic109 cfu) and streptococcus thermophilus th-4 (1small ha, cyrillic108 cfu) administration on gastrointestinal symptoms of cow's milk allergy in infants. we conducted an open randomized prospective clinical study. 60 infants aged of 3-12 months with the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and allergy to cow's milk protein were enrolled. children were divided into 2 groups, one of which received probiotics during 4 weeks. results were estimated after 4 and 8 weeks of study. we found significant impact on reducing the frequency of constipation in infants who received the probiotics in complex treatment. after 4 weeks of treatment constipation was absent in 85.71% infants who received probiotics as compared to 48.15% in the control group (small er, cyrillic=0.02),  after 8 weeks the same numbers were 92.86% vs. 62.96% accordingly (p=0.04). significant differences between the groups were also determined by the incidences of infantile colic through 4 and 8 weeks and on diarrhea through 8 weeks of studies. it is possible to draw a conclusion that administration of probiotics in addition to elimination diet and base treatment to infants with atopic dermatitis and cow's milk allergy improves clinical symptoms of the disease and decreases gastrointestinal clinical manifestations of cow's milk allergy.

TI  == bacterial lysates in food allergy prevention.
AB  == purpose of review: in the concept of food allergy prevention, no successful strategy could be identified until now. although interventional trials using probiotics, prebiotics, hydrolyzed formula and bacterial lysates early in infancy were found to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis, no effect on food sensitization and allergy could be shown. recent findings: studies in a farming environment showed that early contact to livestock, bacteria and moulds may upregulate the immune responses regulated via toll-like receptors and thus prevent allergy. there is increasing evidence that the unbalanced composition of  the human microbiome on human skin and mucosal surfaces may be a key player in the development of inflammatory diseases like allergy and asthma. however, during the last 5 years, this concept could not yet be verified in the interventional trials. there are few studies using bacterial lysates, for example, escherichia coli plus enterococcus faecalis in prosymbioflor and heat-killed bifidobacterium  breve and streptococcus thermophilus; however, food allergy prevalence could not  be reduced by these interventions. summary: during the last 5 years, new interventional trials addressed the use of bacterial lysates. there was only an effect on eczema in the prosymbioflor trial, whereas the trial using b. breve and s. thermophilus in a cow's milk formula showed a slight reduction of food sensitization at the age of 12 months. however, these strategies need further investigation and success seems to be restricted to certain subpopulations.

TI  == probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing conditioned pathogens in ascites.
AB  == aim: to investigate the benefits of probiotics treatment in septic rats. methods: the septic rats were induced by cecal ligation and puncture. the animals of control, septic model and probiotics treated groups were treated with vehicle and mixed probiotics, respectively. the mixture of probiotics included bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus.  we observed the survival of septic rats using different amounts of mixed probiotics. we also detected the bacterial population in ascites and blood of experimental sepsis using cultivation and real-time polymerase chain reaction. the severity of mucosal inflammation in colonic tissues was determined. results:  probiotics treatment improved survival of the rats significantly and this effect  was dose dependent. the survival rate was 30% for vehicle-treated septic model group. however, 1 and 1/4 doses of probiotics treatment increased survival rate significantly compared with septic model group (80% and 55% vs 30%, p < 0.05). the total viable counts of bacteria in ascites decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (5.20 +/- 0.57 vs 9.81  +/- 0.67, p < 0.05). the total positive rate of hemoculture decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (33.3% vs 100.0%, p < 0.05). the population of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in ascites of probiotics treated group were decreased significantly compared with that of septic model group (3.93 +/- 0.73 vs 8.80 +/- 0.83, p < 0.05; 2.80 +/- 1.04 vs 5.39 +/- 1.21, p < 0.05). with probiotics treatment, there was a decrease in the scores of inflammatory cell infiltration into the intestinal mucosa in septic animals (1.50 +/- 0.25 vs 2.88 +/- 0.14, p < 0.01). conclusion: escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus may be primary pathogens in septic rats. probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing these conditioned pathogens.

TI  == rapid assay to assess colonization patterns following in-vivo probiotic ingestion.
AB  == background: colonization of the intestine with some microorganisms has been shown to have beneficial health effects. the association of bacteria with its human host starts soon after birth; however in infants born prematurely establishment of normal intestinal flora is interrupted with colonization with potential pathogenic organisms probiotic supplementation may therefore be beneficial to the health of preterm infants. as most probiotic organisms are difficult to culture,  confirmation of their colonization after supplementation is difficult. in this study, rapid qpcr assays for detection of presence of probiotic species in the intestine by faecal sampling is described in both preterm infant and adult participants. findings: probiotic colonization was determined using qpcr directed at amplification of organisms present in the ingested probiotic streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. infantis. overall, differential detection of probiotic strains in faeces were found between adult and preterm infants, with 50% of infants continuing to shed at least two probiotic strains three weeks after probiotic ingestion had ceased.  conclusions: this study demonstrated rapid assessment of the preterm infant gut for colonization with probiotic strains using real-time pcr. this method would be of great importance in studies of probiotics in prevention of diseases and adverse clinical outcomes.

TI  == crispr-cas and restriction-modification systems are compatible and increase phage resistance.
AB  == bacteria have developed a set of barriers to protect themselves against invaders  such as phage and plasmid nucleic acids. different prokaryotic defence systems exist and at least two of them directly target the incoming dna: restriction-modification (r-m) and crispr-cas systems. on their own, they are imperfect barriers to invasion by foreign dna. here, we show that r-m and crispr-cas systems are compatible and act together to increase the overall phage  resistance of a bacterial cell by cleaving their respective target sites. furthermore, we show that the specific methylation of phage dna does not impair crispr-cas acquisition or interference activities. taken altogether, both mechanisms can be leveraged to decrease phage contaminations in processes relying on bacterial growth and/or fermentation.

AB  == as in the case of probiotic functional foods in recent years, demand has increased notably for light or diet foods with added sweeteners. however, little  is known about the effect of different sweeteners on the microorganisms present.  thus, the objective of the current study was to establish the ideal sucrose concentration and equivalent concentrations of different sweeteners and to determine, by microbiological analyses, the influence of these compounds on the viability of the starter and probiotic cultures used in the production of strawberry-flavored petit suisse cheese during its shelf life. the ideal sucrose  concentration was determined using the just-about-right (jar) scale, and the equivalent concentrations of the sweeteners were subsequently determined by the magnitude estimation method. microbiological analyses were also carried out to check the viability of the cultures during the product's shelf life. the results  showed that the compounds neotame (nutrasweet, chicago, il) and stevia presented, respectively, the greatest and least sweetening power of the sweeteners tested. none of the sweeteners used in this study exerted a negative effect on the viability of the starter or probiotic cultures, and thus we were able to obtain a probiotic, functional food with reduced calorie content.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis reveals the coexistence of interfamily and interspecies horizontal gene transfer in streptococcus thermophilus strains isolated from the  same yoghurt.
AB  == horizontal gene transfer (hgt) is an important evolutionary mechanism that has shaped prokaryotic genomes. for streptococcus thermophilus, there is no direct evidence that the bacteria might acquire a second paralog from a different origin in the same niche. in this study, we found that four isolates of s. thermophilus  (b, c, e and f) from the same yoghurt contained two putative homologs of the eno  genes (eno-1 and eno-2) and two putative homologs of the guab genes (guab-1 and guab-2). both eno-1 and guab-1 shared 100% nucleotide identity among the four isolates, and with isolate a and s. thermophilus nd03. phylogenetic and nucleotide divergence analyses indicated that guab-2 of these isolates may have been acquired from species in the genus streptococcus, while eno-2 of isolates b  and c may have been acquired from a donor in the genus streptococcus. the eno-2 genes of isolates e and f may have been acquired from a donor in the enterococcus genera. relative synonymous codon usage analysis confirmed the eno-2 genes of isolates e and f as being acquired from a donor in genus enterococcus. this study provides evidence that interfamily and interspecies hgt occur in s. thermophilus  strains isolated from the same niche.

TI  == diversity of thermophilic bacteria in raw, pasteurized and selectively-cultured milk, as assessed by culturing, pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing.
AB  == thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab) species, such as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus helveticus, enjoy worldwide economic importance as dairy starters. to assess the diversity of thermophilic bacteria in milk, milk samples were enriched in thermophilic organisms through a stepwise procedure which included pasteurization of milk at 63 degrees c for 30 min (pm samples) and pasteurization followed by incubation at 42 degrees c for 24 h (ipm samples). the microbial composition of these samples was analyzed by culture-dependent (at 42 degrees c) and culture-independent (pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons) microbial techniques. the results were then compared to those obtained for their corresponding starting raw milk counterparts (rm samples). twenty different species were scored by culturing among 352 isolates purified from the counting plates and identified by  molecular methods. mesophilic lab species (lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae) were dominant (87% of the isolates) among the rm samples. however, s. thermophilus and lb. delbrueckii were found to be the dominant recoverable organisms in both pm and ipm samples. the dgge profiles of rm and pm samples were found to be very similar; the most prominent bands belonging to lactococcus, leuconostoc and streptococcus species. in contrast, just three dgge bands were obtained for ipm samples, two of which were assigned to s. thermophilus. the pyrosequencing results scored 95 operational taxonomic units (otus) at 3% sequence divergence in an rm sample, while only 13 were encountered in two ipm samples. this technique identified leuconostoc citreum as the dominant microorganism in the rm sample, while s. thermophilus constituted more than 98% of the reads in the ipm samples. the procedure followed in this study allowed to  estimate the bacterial diversity in milk and afford a suitable strategy for the isolation of new thermophilic lab strains, among which adequate starters might be selected.

AB  == amino acid residues that are important for metal binding and catalysis in gram-positive phosphotyrosine phosphatases were identified in the wzh protein of  streptococcus thermophilus mr-1c by using sequence comparisons. a his-tagged fusion wzh protein was purified from escherichia coli cultures and tested for phosphatase activity against synthetic phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine-threonine peptides. purified wzh released 2316.5 +/- 138.7 pmol po4.min(-1).mug(-1) from phosphotyrosine peptide-1 and 2345.7 +/- 135.2 pmol po4.min(-1).mug(-1) from phosphotyrosine peptide-2. the presence of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate decreased purified wzh activity by 45%-50% at 1 mmol.l(-1), 74%-84% at 5 mmol.l(-1), and by at least 88% at 10 mmol.l(-1). purified wzh had no detectable activity against the phosphoserine-threonine peptide. these results clearly establish that s. thermophilus mr-1c wzh functions as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase that could function to remove phosphate groups from proteins involved in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, including the protein tyrosine kinase wze and priming glycosyltransferase.

TI  == x-ray structure of a superinfection exclusion lipoprotein from phage tp-j34 and identification of the tape measure protein as its target.
AB  == lipoproteins of temperate phage are a broad family of membrane proteins encoded in the lysogeny module of temperate phages. expression of the ltp(tp-j34) gene of temperate streptococcus thermophilus phage tp-j34 interferes with phage infection at the stage of triggering dna release and injection into the cell. here, we report the first structure of a superinfection exclusion protein. we have expressed and determined the x-ray structure of ltp(tp-j34). the soluble domain of ltp(tp-j34) is composed of a tandem of three-helix helix-turn-helix (hth) domains exhibiting a highly negatively charged surface. by isolating mutants of lactococcal phage p008wt with reduced sensitivities to ltp(tp-j34) and by genome  sequencing of such mutants we obtained evidence supporting the notion that ltp(tp-j34) targets the phage's tape measure protein (tmp) and blocks its insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane.

TI  == characterization of new exopolysaccharides produced by coculturing of l. kefiranofaciens with yoghurt strains.
AB  == this project was designed to study the coculturing affect of exopolysaccharide (eps) producing strains lactobacillus kefiranofaciens (l.k) zw3, with non eps producing strains l. bulgaricus (l.b) and streptococcus thermophilus (s.t) in three different combinations: l.k+l.b, l.k+s.t, and l.k+l.b+s.t. ftir analysis revealed presence of strong stretch in regions of 3400, 2900 and 1647cm(-1) which is characteristic of a typical polysaccharide. co-cultured epss were composed of  glucose, galactose, arabinose and xylose; and their sugar compositions were different from zw3 polysaccharide that was mainly composed of gluco-galactan. peak temperature for l.k+l.b, l.k+s.t, l.k+s.t+l.b and zw3 polymers were 90.59, 87.61, 95.18 and 97.38 degrees c, respectively. thermal analysis revealed degradation temperature of 326.44, 294.6, 296.7 and 299.62 degrees c for l.k+l.b, l.k+s.t, l.k+s.t+l.b and zw3 polymers, respectively. sem and afm analysis divulged that three cocultured epss had different surface morphology than zw3 polymer. since co-cultured polymers have different structure than the polymer produced exclusively by eps producing strain, it can be safely concluded from the study that co-culturing can be one way to change the structure of polymers. coculturing of l. kefiranofaciens with non-eps producing strains resulted in yoghurt with increased viscosity and delayed syneresis.

TI  == incorporation of soybean by-product okara and inulin in a probiotic soy yoghurt:  texture profile and sensory acceptance.
AB  == background: this study evaluated the effect of inulin and okara flour on textural and sensory properties of probiotic soy yoghurt (sy) throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees c. employing a 2(2) design, four formulations of sy produced from soymilk and fermented with an abt-4 culture (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 and streptococcus thermophilus) were studied: sy-c (control); sy-i (with inulin); sy-o (with okara); sy-io (with inulin + okara). results: the addition of okara and the refrigerated storage led to significant differences in the instrumental texture parameters of sy (p < 0.05). inulin and okara did not affect sy sensory acceptability (p > 0.05), but there was a tendency for higher scores in the presence of inulin. on the other hand, the storage period, particularly at 21 days, was unfavourable regarding the acceptance of the different sy. conclusion: the results showed that the addition  of okara flour and the storage were significant factors to increase firmness of the soy yoghurts. sy acceptability was not affected by the incorporation of inulin or okara. these results suggest that okara, discarded as industrial waste, may be used in probiotic soy yoghurt, helping to increase the nutritional and functional properties without altering its acceptability.

TI  == diversity of streptococcus thermophilus in bacteriocin production; inhibitory spectrum and occurrence of thermophilin genes.
AB  == the bacteriocin-producing streptococcus thermophilus strains that can dominate in natural dairy ecosystems, may also enhance safety in products obtained from natural cultures. in this study, we sought to identify bacteriocin production and bacteriocin genes in 75 strains of dairy and plant origin. the strains were tested for antimicrobial activity against pathogens or pathogen models, spoiling  bacteria, and lactic acid bacteria associated with dairy products. all strains moderately inhibited staphylococcus aureus p310, none inhibited listeria innocua  lmg 11387(t) or clostridium tyrobutyricum lmg 1285(t). in addition, 14 were active against one or more indicators in addition to s. aureus p310. inhibition of other starter bacteria was more common than the inhibition of unwanted microorganisms. the involvement of a proteinaceous compound was ascertained in all cases. results suggested that the selection of bacteriocinogenic s. thermophilus strains for use in biopreservation must take into account the effects exerted on other lactic acid bacteria. pcr detection of thermophilin genes proved unreliable in predicting antimicrobial activity. for s. thermophilus pri36 and pri45, with relevant inhibitory features, the identity of the bacteriocin genes present in the thermophilin 9 cluster was defined, thus revealing novel variants for this genome region.

TI  == high-throughput analysis of type i-e crispr/cas spacer acquisition in e. coli.
AB  == in escherichia coli, the acquisition of new crispr spacers is strongly stimulated by a priming interaction between a spacer in crispr rna and a protospacer in foreign dna. priming also leads to a pronounced bias in dna strand from which new spacers are selected. here, ca. 200,000 spacers acquired during e. coli type i-e  crispr/cas-driven plasmid elimination were analyzed. analysis of positions of plasmid protospacers from which newly acquired spacers have been derived is inconsistent with spacer acquisition machinery sliding along the target dna as the primary mechanism responsible for strand bias during primed spacer acquisition. most protospacers that served as donors of newly acquired spacers during primed spacer acquisition had an aag protospacer adjacent motif, pam. yet, the introduction of multiple aag sequences in the target dna had no effect on the choice of protospacers used for adaptation, which again is inconsistent with the  sliding mechanism. despite a strong preference for an aag pam during crispr adaptation, the aag (and ctt) triplets do not appear to be avoided in known e. coli phages. likewise, pam sequences are not avoided in streptococcus thermophilus phages, indicating that crispr/cas systems may not have been a strong factor in shaping host-virus interactions.

TI  == significant effect of ca2+ on improving the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria (lab) has been extensively investigated due to its highly practical significance. reconstituted skim milk (rsm) has been found to be one of the most effective protectant wall materials for microencapsulating microorganisms during convective drying, such as spray drying. in addition to proteins and carbohydrate, rsm is rich in calcium. it is not clear which component is critical in the rsm protection mechanism. this study investigated the independent effect of calcium. ca(2+) was added to lactose solution to examine its influence on the heat resistance of lactobacillus rhamnosus zy, lactobacillus casei zhang, lactobacillus plantarum p8 and streptococcus thermophilus nd03. the results showed that certain ca(2+) concentrations enhanced the heat resistance of the lab strains to different extents, that is produced higher survival and shorter regrowth lag times of the bacterial cells. in some cases, the improvements were dramatic. more scientifically insightful and more intensive instrumental study of the ca(2+) behavior around and in the cells should be carried out in the near future. in the meantime, this work may lead to the development of more cost-effective wall materials with ca(2+) added as a prime factor.

TI  == diversity of human small intestinal streptococcus and veillonella populations.
AB  == molecular and cultivation approaches were employed to study the phylogenetic richness and temporal dynamics of streptococcus and veillonella populations in the small intestine. microbial profiling of human small intestinal samples collected from four ileostomy subjects at four time points displayed abundant populations of streptococcus spp. most affiliated with s. salivarius, s. thermophilus, and s. parasanguinis, as well as veillonella spp. affiliated with v. atypica, v. parvula, v. dispar, and v. rogosae. relative abundances varied per subject and time of sampling. streptococcus and veillonella isolates were cultured using selective media from ileostoma effluent samples collected at two time points from a single subject. the richness of the streptococcus and veillonella isolates was assessed at species and strain level by 16s rrna gene sequencing and genetic fingerprinting, respectively. a total of 160 streptococcus and 37 veillonella isolates were obtained. genetic fingerprinting differentiated  seven streptococcus lineages from ileostoma effluent, illustrating the strain richness within this ecosystem. the veillonella isolates were represented by a single phylotype. our study demonstrated that the small intestinal streptococcus  populations displayed considerable changes over time at the genetic lineage level because only representative strains of a single streptococcus lineage could be cultivated from ileostoma effluent at both time points.

TI  == crrna and tracrrna guide cas9-mediated dna interference in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the cas9-crrna complex of the streptococcus thermophilus dgcc7710 crispr3-cas system functions as an rna-guided endonuclease with crrna-directed target sequence recognition and protein-mediated dna cleavage. we show here that an additional rna molecule, tracrrna (trans-activating crispr rna), co-purifies with the cas9 protein isolated from the heterologous e. coli strain carrying the s. thermophilus dgcc7710 crispr3-cas system. we provide experimental evidence that tracrrna is required for cas9-mediated dna interference both in vitro and in vivo. we show that cas9 specifically promotes duplex formation between the precursor crrna (pre-crrna) transcript and tracrrna, in vitro. furthermore, the housekeeping rnase iii contributes to primary pre-crrna-tracrrna duplex cleavage  for mature crrna biogenesis. rnase iii, however, is not required in the processing of a short pre-crrna transcribed from a minimal crispr array containing a single spacer. finally, we show that an in vitro-assembled ternary cas9-crrna-tracrrna complex cleaves dna. this study further specifies the molecular basis for crrna-based re-programming of cas9 to specifically cleave any target dna sequence for precise genome surgery. the processes for crrna maturation and effector complex assembly established here will contribute to the  further development of the cas9 re-programmable system for genome editing applications.

AB  == the physicochemical determinants governing the temperature-dependent adhesion of  streptococcus thermophilus to abiotic surfaces are identified under physiological condition for cells either lacking or not the rgg0182 transcriptional regulator involved in their thermal adaptation. for that purpose, the wild type lmg18311 strain and deltargg0182 mutant were imaged using highly resolved atomic force microscopy (afm) at various cell growth temperatures (42 to 55 degrees c). the corresponding hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the cells was quantitatively addressed via the measurement by chemical force microcopy of their adhesion to a  reference hydrophobic surface. analysis of force-separation distance curves further allowed us to discriminate cell surfaces according to the presence or absence of biopolymers. these results were interpreted in relation to the measured adhesion of the deltargg0182 mutant onto the hydrophobic wall of microwells in the temperature range from 46 to 52 degrees c. it is evidenced that the viscoelastic deltargg0182 cell envelop behaves as a thermo-responsive film whose hydrophobicity increases with increasing temperature, thereby favoring cell attachment to hydrophobic surfaces. regardless cell growth temperature, wild-type cells do not attach to hydrophobic surfaces and the presence of the rgg0182 transcriptional regulator is associated with the synthesis of hydrophilic cell surface biopolymers. throughout, the impact of electrostatics on bioadhesion is ruled out upon examination of electrohydrodynamic cell properties at 50 degrees c.

TI  == comparative genome analysis of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius cj18, an african fermented camel milk isolate with adaptations to dairy environment.
AB  == background: streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex associated with several human and animal infections. sii is a predominant bacterium in spontaneously fermented  milk products in africa. the genome sequence of sii strain cj18 was compared with that of other streptococcus species to identify dairy adaptations including genome decay such as in streptococcus thermophilus, traits for its competitiveness in spontaneous milk fermentation and to assess potential health risks for consumers. results: the genome of sii cj18 harbors several unique regions in comparison to sii atcc baa-102t, among others an enlarged exo- and capsular polysaccharide operon; streptococcus thermophilus-associated genes; a region containing metabolic and hypothetical genes mostly unique to cj18 and the  dairy isolate streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus; and a second oligopeptide transport operon. dairy adaptations in cj18 are reflected by a high  percentage of pseudogenes (4.9%) representing genome decay which includes the inactivation of the lactose phosphotransferase system (laciiabc) by multiple transposases integration. the presence of lacs and lacz genes is the major dairy  adaptation affecting lactose metabolism pathways also due to the disruption of laciiabc.we constructed mutant strains of lacs, lacz and laciiabc and analyzed the resulting strains of cj18 to confirm the redirection of lactose metabolism via lacs and lacz.natural competence genes are conserved in both sii strains, but cj18 contains a lower number of crispr spacers which indicates a reduced defense  capability against alien dna. no classical streptococcal virulence factors were detected in both sii strains apart from those involved in adhesion which should be considered niche factors. sii-specific virulence factors are not described. several sii-specific regions encoding uncharacterized proteins provide new leads  for virulence analyses and investigation of the unclear association of dairy and  clinical sii with human diseases. conclusions: the genome of the african dairy isolate sii cj18 clearly differs from the human isolate atcc baa-102t. cj18 possesses a high natural competence predisposition likely explaining the enlarged genome. metabolic adaptations to the dairy environment are evident and especially lactose uptake corresponds to s. thermophilus. genome decay is not as advanced as in s. thermophilus (10-19%) possibly due to a shorter history in dairy fermentations.

TI  == the population and evolutionary dynamics of phage and bacteria with crispr-mediated immunity.
AB  == clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr), together with associated genes (cas), form the crispr-cas adaptive immune system, which can provide resistance to viruses and plasmids in bacteria and archaea. here, we use  mathematical models, population dynamic experiments, and dna sequence analyses to investigate the host-phage interactions in a model crispr-cas system, streptococcus thermophilus dgcc7710 and its virulent phage 2972. at the molecular level, the bacteriophage-immune mutant bacteria (bims) and crispr-escape mutant phage (cems) obtained in this study are consistent with those anticipated from an iterative model of this adaptive immune system: resistance by the addition of novel spacers and phage evasion of resistance by mutation in matching sequences or flanking motifs. while crispr bims were readily isolated and cems generated at high rates (frequencies in excess of 10(-6)), our population studies indicate that there is more to the dynamics of phage-host interactions and the establishment of a bim-cem arms race than predicted from existing assumptions about phage infection and crispr-cas immunity. among the unanticipated observations are: (i) the invasion of phage into populations of bims resistant by the acquisition of one (but not two) spacers, (ii) the survival of sensitive bacteria despite the presence of high densities of phage, and (iii) the maintenance of phage-limited communities due to the failure of even two-spacer bims to become established in populations with wild-type bacteria and phage. we attribute (i) to incomplete resistance of single-spacer bims. based on the results of additional modeling and experiments, we postulate that (ii) and (iii)  can be attributed to the phage infection-associated production of enzymes or other compounds that induce phenotypic phage resistance in sensitive bacteria and kill resistant bims. we present evidence in support of these hypotheses and discuss the implications of these results for the ecology and (co)evolution of bacteria and phage.

TI  == consumption of fermented milk product with probiotic modulates brain activity.
AB  == background & aims: changes in gut microbiota have been reported to alter signaling mechanisms, emotional behavior, and visceral nociceptive reflexes in rodents. however, alteration of the intestinal microbiota with antibiotics or probiotics has not been shown to produce these changes in humans. we investigated whether consumption of a fermented milk product with probiotic (fmpp) for 4 weeks by healthy women altered brain intrinsic connectivity or responses to emotional attention tasks. methods: healthy women with no gastrointestinal or psychiatric symptoms were randomly assigned to groups given fmpp (n = 12), a nonfermented milk product (n = 11, controls), or no intervention (n = 13) twice daily for 4 weeks. the fmpp contained bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis, streptococcus thermophiles, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and lactococcus lactis subsp lactis. participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after the intervention to measure brain response to an emotional faces attention task and resting brain activity. multivariate and region of interest analyses were performed. results: fmpp intake was associated with reduced task-related response of a distributed functional network (49% cross-block covariance; p = .004) containing affective, viscerosensory, and somatosensory cortices. alterations in  intrinsic activity of resting brain indicated that ingestion of fmpp was associated with changes in midbrain connectivity, which could explain the observed differences in activity during the task. conclusions: four-week intake of an fmpp by healthy women affected activity of brain regions that control central processing of emotion and sensation.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics in preventing episodes of acute otitis media in high-risk children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == background: several studies have suggested that probiotics (prob) and/or prebiotics (preb) could reduce the burden of infection in infants and toddlers. we aimed to determine whether follow-up formula supplemented with prob and preb could reduce the risk of acute otitis media (aom). methods: in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from november 2007 to april 2009, 37 pediatricians in france enrolled children 7 to 13 months of age with high risk of aom who were randomly assigned to receive follow-up formula supplemented with prob (streptococcus thermophilus ncc 2496, streptococcus salivarius dsm 13084, lactobacillus rhamnosus lpr cgmcc 1.3724) and preb (raftilose/raftiline) or follow-up formula alone (placebo). during 12 months, the 2 groups were compared for number of aom episodes diagnosed (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes by  the poisson model (incidence rate ratio [irr]) or logistic regression (odds ratio; and 95% confidence interval [95% ci]) after adjustment on covariates of interest. results: we enrolled 224 children (112 in each group). all children were vaccinated (4 doses) with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; demographic characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. in total, 486 aom episodes were reported, 249 and 237 in the treatment and control groups, respectively. the treatment and control groups did not differ in incidence of aom (irr 1.0, 95% ci: 0.8-1.2), lower respiratory tract infections (irr 0.9, 0.7-1.2) or number of antibiotic treatment courses (irr = 1.0, 95% ci: 0.8-1.2). treatment was not associated with recurrent aom (odds ratio 1.0, 95% ci: 0.5-1.7). with regard to gastrointestinal disorders, both formulas were well tolerated. conclusion: the prob and preb included in follow-up formula given to children at  7 to 13 months of age did not reduce the risk of aom, recurrent aom, antibiotic use or lower respiratory tract infections at 1 year.

TI  == monitoring lactic acid production during milk fermentation by in situ quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  == when fermenting milk, lactic bacteria convert part of alpha- and beta-lactoses into d- and l- lactic acids, causing a ph decrease responsible for casein coagulation. lactic acid monitoring during fermentation is essential for the control of dairy gel textural and organoleptic properties, and is a way to evaluate strain efficiency. currently, titrations are used to follow the quantity of acids formed during jellification of milk but they are not specific to lactic  acid. an analytical method without the use of any reagent was investigated to quantify lactic acid during milk fermentation: in situ quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. two methods using in situ quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were compared: (1) d- and l-lactic acids content determination, using the resonance of their methyl protons, showing an increase from 2.06 +/- 0.02 to 8.16 +/- 0.74 g/l during 240 min of fermentation; and (2) the determination of the alpha- and beta-lactoses content,  decreasing from 42.68 +/- 0.02 to 30.76 +/- 1.75 g/l for the same fermentation duration. the ratio between the molar concentrations of produced lactic acids and consumed lactoses enabled cross-validation, as the value (2.02 +/- 0.18) is consistent with lactic acid bacteria metabolism.

TI  == extracellular life cycle of coms, the competence-stimulating peptide of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == in streptococci, comx is the alternative sigma factor controlling the transcription of the genes encoding the genetic transformation machinery. in streptococcus thermophilus, comx transcription is controlled by a complex consisting of a transcriptional regulator of the rgg family, comr, and a signaling peptide, coms, which controls comr activity. following its initial production, coms is processed, secreted, and imported back into the cell by the ami oligopeptide transporter. we characterized these steps and the partners interacting with coms during its extracellular circuit in more detail. we identified the mature form of coms and demonstrated the involvement of the membrane protease eep in coms processing. we found that coms was secreted but probably not released into the extracellular medium. natural competence was first discovered in a chemically defined medium without peptides. we show here that the presence of a high concentration of nutritional peptides in the medium prevents the triggering of competence. in milk, the ecological niche of s. thermophilus, competence was found to be functional, suggesting that the concentration of nutritional peptides was too low to interfere with comr activation. the kinetics  of expression of the coms, comr, and comx genes and of a late competence gene, dpra, in cultures inoculated at different initial densities revealed that the activation mechanism of comr by coms is more a timing device than a quorum-sensing mechanism sensu stricto. we concluded that the coms extracellular  circuit facilitates tight control over the triggering of competence in s. thermophilus.

TI  == strong bias in the bacterial crispr elements that confer immunity to phage.
AB  == clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cas systems provide adaptive immunity against phage via spacer-encoded crispr rnas that are complementary to invasive nucleic acids. here, we challenge streptococcus thermophilus with a bacteriophage, and used pcr-based metagenomics to monitor phage-derived spacers daily for 15 days in two experiments. spacers that target the host chromosome are infrequent and strongly selected against, suggesting autoimmunity is lethal. in experiments that recover over half a million spacers,  we observe early dominance by a few spacer sub-populations and rapid oscillations in sub-population abundances. in two crispr systems and in replicate experiments, a few spacers account for the majority of spacer sequences. nearly all phage locations targeted by the acquired spacers have a proto-spacer adjacent motif (pam), indicating pams are involved in spacer acquisition. we detect a strong and reproducible bias in the phage genome locations from which spacers derive. this may reflect selection for specific spacers based on location and effectiveness.

TI  == assembly and mechanism of a group ii ecf transporter.
AB  == energy-coupling factor (ecf) transporters are a recently discovered family of primary active transporters for micronutrients and vitamins, such as biotin, thiamine, and riboflavin. found exclusively in archaea and bacteria, including the human pathogens listeria, streptococcus, and staphylococcus, ecf transporters may be the only means of vitamin acquisition in these organisms. the subunit composition of ecf transporters is similar to that of atp binding cassette (abc)  importers, whereby both systems share two homologous atpase subunits (a and a'),  a high affinity substrate-binding subunit (s), and a transmembrane coupling subunit (t). however, the s subunit of ecf transporters is an integral membrane protein, and the transmembrane coupling subunits do not share an obvious sequence homology between the two transporter families. moreover, the subunit stoichiometry of ecf transporters is controversial, and the detailed molecular interactions between subunits and the conformational changes during substrate translocation are unknown. we have characterized the ecf transporters from thermotoga maritima and streptococcus thermophilus. our data suggests a subunit stoichiometry of 2s:2t:1a:1a' and that s subunits for different substrates can be incorporated into the same transporter complex simultaneously. in the first crystal structure of the a-a' heterodimer, each subunit contains a novel motif called the q-helix that plays a key role in subunit coupling with the t subunits. taken together, these findings suggest a mechanism for coupling atp binding and hydrolysis to transmembrane transport by ecf transporters.

TI  == in vitro reconstitution of cascade-mediated crispr immunity in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-encoded immunity in type i systems relies on the cascade (crispr-associated complex for antiviral defence) ribonucleoprotein complex, which triggers foreign dna degradation by an accessory cas3 protein. to establish the mechanism for adaptive immunity provided by the streptococcus thermophilus crispr4-cas (crispr-associated) system (st-crispr4-cas), we isolated an effector complex (st-cascade) containing 61-nucleotide crispr rna (crrna). we show that st-cascade, guided by crrna, binds in vitro to a matching proto-spacer if a proto-spacer adjacent motif (pam) is present. surprisingly, the pam sequence determined from binding analysis is promiscuous and limited to a single nucleotide (a or t) immediately upstream (-1 position) of the proto-spacer. in the presence of a correct pam, st-cascade binding to the target dna generates an  r-loop that serves as a landing site for the cas3 atpase/nuclease. we show that cas3 binding to the displaced strand in the r-loop triggers dna cleavage, and if  atp is present, cas3 further degrades dna in a unidirectional manner. these findings establish a molecular basis for crispr immunity in st-crispr4-cas and other type i systems.

TI  == increasing antioxidant activity of procyanidin extracts from the pericarp of litchi chinensis processing waste by two probiotic bacteria bioconversions.
AB  == litchi chinensis pericarp from litchi processing waste is an important plant source of a-type procyanidins, which were considered a natural dietary supplement because of their high biological activity in vivo. litchi pericarp oligomeric procyanidins (lpopcs) did not selectively modify the growth of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus casei -01 at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/ml, and it was demonstrated that the two strains could transform procyanidins during  their log period of growth by two different pathways. s. thermophilus was able to metabolize procyanidin a2 to its isomer, and l. casei could decompose flavan-3-ols into 3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, m-coumaric acid, and p-coumaric acid. the total antioxidant capability (t-aoc) of lpopcs before and after microbial incubation was estimated, and the results suggested that probiotic bacteria bioconversion is a feasible and efficient method to convert litchi pericarp procyanidins to a more effective antioxidant agent.

TI  == high-resolution heteronuclear multidimensional nmr of proteins in living insect cells using a baculovirus protein expression system.
AB  == recent developments in in-cell nmr techniques have allowed us to study proteins in detail inside living eukaryotic cells. in order to complement the existing protocols, and to extend the range of possible applications, we introduce a novel approach for observing in-cell nmr spectra using the sf9 cell/baculovirus system. high-resolution 2d (1)h-(15)n correlation spectra were observed for four model proteins expressed in sf9 cells. furthermore, 3d triple-resonance nmr spectra of  the streptococcus protein g b1 domain were observed in sf9 cells by using nonlinear sampling to overcome the short lifetime of the samples and the low abundance of the labeled protein. the data were processed with a quantitative maximum entropy algorithm. these were assigned ab initio, yielding approximately  80% of the expected backbone nmr resonances. well-resolved noe cross peaks could  be identified in the 3d (15)n-separated noesy spectrum, suggesting that structural analysis of this size of protein will be feasible in sf9 cells.

TI  == mechanism of competence activation by the comrs signalling system in streptococci.
AB  == in many streptococci, competence for natural dna transformation is regulated by the rgg-type regulator comr and the pheromone coms, which is sensed intracellularly. we compared the comrs systems of four model streptococcal species using in vitro and in silico approaches, to determine the mechanism of the comrs-dependent regulation of competence. in all systems investigated, comr was shown to be the proximal transcriptional activator of the expression of key competence genes. efficient binding of comr to dna is strictly dependent on the presence of the pheromone (c-terminal coms octapeptide), in contrast with other streptococcal rgg-type regulators. the 20 bp palindromic comr-box is the minimal  genetic requirement for binding of comr, and its sequence directly determines the expression level of genes under its control. despite the apparent species-specific specialization of the comr-coms interaction, mutagenesis of coms residues from streptococcus thermophilus highlighted an unexpected permissiveness with respect to its biological activity. in agreement, heterologous coms, and even primary sequence-unrelated, casein-derived octapeptides, were able to induce competence development in s. thermophilus. the lack of stringency of coms sequence suggests that competence of a specific streptococcus species may be modulated by other streptococci or by non-specific nutritive oligopeptides present in its environment.

TI  == effect of lactic fermentation on the total phenolic, saponin and phytic acid contents as well as anti-colon cancer cell proliferation activity of soymilk.
AB  == in an attempt to develop healthy dietary adjuncts, soymilk was fermented simultaneously with streptococcus thermophilus 14085 and bifidobacterium infantis 14603 at 37 degrees c for 24 h. it was found that lactic fermentation reduced the content of saponins and phytates, which possess antinutritional activity, and enhanced the total phenolic content as well as antitumor cell proliferation effect of soymilk against ht-29 and caco-2 cells. the original antitumor cell component, starter organisms, and antitumor cell bioactive principles formed in soymilk during fermentation, might all have contributed to the enhanced antitumor activity of fermented soymilk. the antiproliferative effect of the extracts varied with extraction solvent. extracts obtained from fermented soymilk with 80% methanol exhibited the highest suppression effect on the proliferation of ht-29 and caco-2 cells. this study further stresses the potential of developing soymilk as a healthy dietary adjunct possessing enhanced anticancer activity through the  use of lactic fermentation.

TI  == development of a multiplex real time pcr to detect thermophilic lactic acid bacteria in natural whey starters.
AB  == a multiplex real time pcr (mrealt-pcr) useful to rapidly screen microbial composition of thermophilic starter cultures for hard cooked cheeses and to compare samples with potentially different technological properties was developed. novel primers directed toward phes gene were designed and optimized for multiple detection of lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus fermentum. the assay was based on sybr green chemistry followed by melting curves analysis. the method was then evaluated for applications in the specific detection of the 4 lactic acid bacteria (lab) in 29 different natural whey starters for parmigiano reggiano cheese production. the results obtained by mrealt-pcr were also compared with those obtained on the same samples by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and length-heterogeneity pcr (lh-pcr). the mrealt-pcr developed in this study, was found to be effective for analyzing species present in the samples with an average sensitivity down to less than 600 copies of dna and therefore sensitive enough to detect even minor lab community members of thermophilic starter cultures. the assay was able to describe the microbial population of all the different natural whey starter samples analyzed, despite their natural variability. a higher number of whey starter samples with s. thermophilus and l.  fermentum present in their microbial community were revealed, suggesting that these species could be more frequent in parmigiano reggiano natural whey starter  samples than previously shown. the method was more effective than lh-pcr and fish and, considering that these two techniques have to be used in combination to detect the less abundant species, the mrealt-pcr was also faster. providing a single step sensitive detection of l. helveticus, l. delbrueckii, s. thermophilus and l. fermentum, the developed mrealt-pcr could be used for screening thermophilic starter cultures and to follow the presence of those species during  ripening of derived dairy products. a major increase in understanding the starter culture contribution to cheese ecosystem could be harnessed to control cheese ripening and flavor formation.

TI  == changes in fatty acid profile of feta cheese including conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == background: during the last two decades much attention has been given to conjugated linoleic acid (cla) because of its potentially beneficial biological effects. cheese is one of the major dietary sources of cla. however, the cla content of greek cheeses is variable and affected by many factors. fatty acid analysis of feta cheese, made of sheep's milk, was conducted at different stages  of the manufacturing process in order to monitor and explain fatty acid and especially cla changes. results: cla content in fresh milk and during the early stages of manufacture was 0.66 +/- 0.02 g 100 g(-)(1) fatty acids; it increased during the ripening process (0.75 +/- 0.06 g 100 g(-)(1) fatty acids) and decreased during storage (0.52 +/- 0.15 g 100 g(-)(1) fatty acids). saturated fatty acids (sfa), increased after 37 and 48 days of aging, while monounsaturated fatty acids (mufa) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa), showed the opposite tendency. conclusion: cla content significantly increased during the ripening stages and decreased during aging (p </= 0.05). cla is not stable during manufacture and storage of feta cheese, a fact which should be resolved, since this biologically active substance can be obtained from the diet.

AB  == isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase is an essential enzyme in those living organisms such as pathogenic strains of streptococcus and staphylococcus genera which rely on the mevalonate pathway for the production of isoprenoids. the pathogens contain type 2 idi in contrast to human that contains type 1 idi. therefore, the type 2 idi may be a potential target for the therapy of some infectious diseases. in the current study, a virtual screening by docking was performed among 2000 chemicals from cococo library to find a specific inhibitor for type 2 idis. to this end, the structures of the type 2 idis of bacillus licheniformis, pseudomonas stutzeri, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were molded using comparative modeling and hidden markov model (hmm) based prediction. the predicted models were evaluated based on q-mean and prosa score.  molegro virtual docker with moldock scoring function was used for measuring the binding affinity of the found inhibitor to the active site of the models. also the inhibition effect of the compound was virtually tested on the crystallography-solved structures of the sulfolobus shibatae and thermus thermophilus type 2 idis as well as the escherichia coli type 1 idi. finally, the inhibition effect of the found inhibitor was virtually tested on the human type 1 idi. interestingly, the results suggest that the inhibitor efficiently binds to and inhibits the bacterial idis especially the type 2 idis of pathogens while it  is not inhibiting the human idi.

TI  == effect of formic acid on exopolysaccharide production in skim milk fermentation by lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus oll1073r-1.
AB  == in yogurt, the formation of formate by streptococcus thermophilus stimulates the  activity of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus). however, there have been no reports how formic acid acts on the exopolysaccharide (eps) production of l. bulgaricus. here, the effect of formate on the eps production in skim milk by l. bulgaricus oll1073r-1 was investigated. after incubation for 24 hr with 100 mg/l formate, cell proliferation and lactic acid production were accelerated. the viable and total cell numbers were increased about ten- and four-fold, respectively. the amount of eps in culture with formate (~116 microg/ml) was also four-fold greater than that of the control (~27 microg/ml). although elongation of cells was observed at 6 hr of cultivation in both cultures, cells cultivated with formate returned to a normal shape after incubation for 24 hr. the sensitivity to cell wall hydrolase and composition of surface layer proteins, as well as the cell membrane fatty acid composition of l. bulgaricus oll1073r-1, were not influenced by formate. however, differences were  observed in intracellular fatty acid compositions and sensitivity to antibiotics. cell length and surface damage returned to normal in cultures with formate. these observations suggest that formic acid is necessary for normal cell growth of l. bulgaricus oll1073r-1 and higher eps production.

TI  == bacteriophages in food fermentations: new frontiers in a continuous arms race.
AB  == phage contamination represents an important risk to any process requiring bacterial growth, particularly in the biotechnology and food industries. the presence of unwanted phages may lead to manufacturing delays, lower quality product, or, in the worst cases, total production loss. thus, constant phage monitoring and stringent application of the appropriate control measures are indispensable. in fact, a systematic preventive approach to phage contamination [phage analysis and critical control points (paccp)] should be put in place. in this review, sources of phage contamination and novel phage detection methods are described, with an emphasis on bacterial viruses that infect lactic acid bacteria used in food fermentations. recent discoveries related to antiphage systems that  are changing our views on phage-host interactions are highlighted. finally, future directions are also discussed.

TI  == isolation and identification of the microbiota of danish farmhouse and industrially produced surface-ripened cheeses.
AB  == for studying the microbiota of four danish surface-ripened cheeses produced at three farmhouses and one industrial dairy, both a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach were used. after dereplication of the initial set of 433 isolates by (gtg)5-pcr fingerprinting, 217 bacterial and 25 yeast isolates were identified by sequencing of the 16s rrna gene or the d1/d2 domain of the 26s rrna gene, respectively. at the end of ripening, the cheese core microbiota of the farmhouse cheeses consisted of the mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab) starter cultures lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and leuconostoc mesenteorides as well as non-starter lab including different lactobacillus spp. the cheese from the industrial dairy was almost exclusively dominated by lb. paracasei. the surface bacterial microbiota of all four cheeses were dominated by corynebacterium spp. and/or brachybacterium spp. brevibacterium spp. was found to be subdominant compared to other bacteria on the farmhouse cheeses, and no brevibacterium spp. was found on the cheese from the industrial dairy, even though b. linens was used as surface-ripening culture. moreover, gram-negative bacteria identified as alcalignes faecalis and proteus vulgaris were found on one of the farmhouse cheeses. the surface yeast microbiota consisted primarily of one dominating species for each cheese. for the farmhouse cheeses, the dominant yeast species were yarrowia lipolytica, geotrichum spp. and debaryomyces hansenii, respectively, and for the cheese from the industrial dairy, d. hansenii was the dominant yeast species. additionally, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis revealed that streptococcus thermophilus was present in the farmhouse raw milk cheese analysed in this study. furthermore, dgge bands corresponding to vagococcus carniphilus, psychrobacter spp. and lb. curvatus on the cheese surfaces indicated that these bacterial species may play a role in cheese ripening.

TI  == sos response activation and competence development are antagonistic mechanisms in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus includes species that either contain or lack the lexa-like repressor (hdir) of the classical sos response. in streptococcus pneumoniae, a species which belongs to the latter group, sos response inducers (e.g., mitomycin c [mc] and fluoroquinolones) were shown to induce natural transformation, leading to the hypothesis that dna damage-induced competence could contribute to genomic  plasticity and stress resistance. using reporter strains and microarray experiments, we investigated the impact of the sos response inducers mitomycin c  and norfloxacin and the role of hdir on competence development in streptococcus thermophilus. we show that both the addition of sos response inducers and hdir inactivation have a dual effect, i.e., induction of the expression of sos genes and reduction of transformability. reduction of transformability results from two different mechanisms, since hdir inactivation has no major effect on the expression of competence (com) genes, while mitomycin c downregulates the expression of early and late com genes in a dose-dependent manner. the downregulation of com genes by mitomycin c was shown to take place at the level of the activation of the comrs signaling system by an unknown mechanism. conversely, we show that a comx-deficient strain is more resistant to mitomycin c and norfloxacin in a viability plate assay, which indicates that competence development negatively affects the resistance of s. thermophilus to dna-damaging  agents. altogether, our results strongly suggest that sos response activation and competence development are antagonistic processes in s. thermophilus.

AB  == homeostasis in the stomach environment is maintained by the balance of protective factors such as gastric mucus and aggressive factors such as gastric acid, stress, alcohol, and drugs. an overload of aggressive factors that upsets this balance can induce gastric injury. fermented milk that contains bifidobacterium bifidum bf-1 (bf-1), a probiotic strain, and streptococcus thermophilus yit 2021  (st) is known to improve helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis in humans. here, we investigated the gastroprotective potential of bf-1 in a rat model of acid-ethanol-induced acute gastric injury to fully elucidate its potential compared with st. living bf-1, st, or vehicle was orally administrated to rats, and acid-ethanol gastric injury was induced 2h later. the gastric injury rate was determined and shown to be significantly lower in the bf-1 group than in the vehicle group, which showed a similar level to the st group. the production of gastric mucin and the expression of several target genes associated with protection and inflammation were examined before and after induction of gastric injury. interestingly, mucin 5ac (muc5ac) gene expression in gastric corpus samples and gastric mucin production in stomach samples from the bf-1 group, but  not the st group, were significantly higher than those in the respective samples  from the vehicle group. these findings indicate that bf-1 has the potential to provide gastroprotection, alleviating acute gastric injury by enhancing the production of gastric mucin in a rat model.

AB  == probiotics which are non-pathogenic live microorganisms ingested along with food  or as dietary supplements, are thought to be beneficial to the host by supporting the microbial balance in digestive system. various studies suggest that the effects of probiotics on the intestinal mucosa and immunity are protective against bacterial translocation. we aimed to investigate bacterial translocation  related to the amount of co2 insufflation given during laparoscopy and the effect of probiotic bacteria in an experimental peritonitis model. in this study 60 wistar rats were used in six groups consisting of 10 rats. group 1, 3 and 5 consisted of the rats that were fed without probiotics, while the rats in group 2, 4, and 6 were fed with water containing 5 x 108 cfu/ml probiotic bacteria complex (bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus) for 15 days. to generate experimental peritonitis, 2 x 107 cfu/ml escherichia coli atcc 25922 was inoculated intraperitoneally to all of the rats.  thereafter, laparoscopy was applied in all groups. application in group 1 and group 2 was without co2; group 3 and group 4 with 14 mmhg co2 insufflation, and group 5 and group 6 with 20 mmhg co2 insufflation. blood samples were taken in 2nd, 4th, and 6th hours. mesenteric lymph node, liver and spleen samples were taken at 6th hour when the rats were sacrificed and then these were evaluated microbiologically with qualitative and quantitative methods. bacterial translocation and bacteremia were found in the rats that were undergone experimental peritonitis during laparoscopy. all positive tissue and blood cultures yielded e.coli. the highest level of bacterial translocation was found to be in mesenteric lymph nodes (in 3/10, 6/10 and 10/10 in groups 1, 3 and 5 fed without probiotics, respectively; in 2/10, 3/10 and 4/10 in groups 2, 4 and 6 fed with probiotics, respectively). the bacterial translocation rates were found to be related to the increased co2 insufflation. it was found that probiotic bacteria were more effective for decreasing bacterial translocation rates and bacteremia in the groups that were given high co2 pressure during laparoscopy. it was also found that these results were correlated with bacterial translocation per gram of tissue. as an example, the quantitative bacterial growth values detected in mesenteric lymph node were 5.4 +/- 2.9 x 103, 10.6 +/- 3.3 x 103 and  21.5 +/- 12.4 x 103 cfu/g in groups 1, 3 and 5, fed without probiotics, respectively; and 2.0 +/- 1.3 x 103, 3.8 +/- 1.9 x 103 and 9.0 +/- 3.1 x 103 cfu/g in groups 2, 4 and 6, fed with probiotics, respectively. our data emphasized that probiotic bacteria may be used as prophylactic agents for the prevention of bacterial translocation during laparoscopy, however comprehensive and clinical studies are needed to support these experimental results.

TI  == effect of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on insulin resistance in pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == background/objectives: owing to excess body weight and increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines primarily during the third trimester, pregnancy is associated with elevated insulin resistance. to our knowledge, no report is available indicating the effects of probiotic yoghurt consumption on serum insulin levels in pregnant women. this study was designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on insulin resistance and serum insulin levels of iranian pregnant women. subjects/methods: in this randomized controlled clinical trial, 70 primigravida pregnant women with singleton pregnancy at their third trimester were participated. we randomly assigned participants to consume 200 g per day of conventional (n=33) or the probiotic group (n=37) for 9 weeks. the probiotic yoghurt was a commercially available product prepared with the starter cultures of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, enriched with probiotic culture of two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus la5) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium  animalis bb12) with a total of min 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units. fasting blood  samples were taken at baseline and after 9-week intervention to measure fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin levels. homeostatic model assessment of insulin  resistance (homa-ir) was used to calculate insulin resistance score. results: although consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks did not affect serum insulin levels and homa-ir score, significant differences were found comparing changes in these variables between probiotic and conventional yogurts (changes from baseline in serum insulin levels: +1.2+/-1.2 vs +5.0+/-1.1 muiu/ml, respectively, p=0.02;  and in homa-ir score: -0.2+/-0.3 vs 0.7+/-0.2, respectively, p=0.01). conclusions: it is concluded that in contrast to conventional yogurt, daily consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks maintains serum insulin levels and might help pregnant women prevent developing insulin resistance.

TI  == blpc-regulated bacteriocin production in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus b59671 produces a bacteriocin with anti-pediococcal activity, but genes required for its production are not characterized. genome sequencing of s. thermophilus has identified a genetic locus encoding a quorum sensing (qs) system that regulates production of class ii bacteriocins. however,  in strains possessing this gene cluster, production of bacteriocin like peptides  (blp) was only observed when excess pheromone was provided. pcr analysis revealed this strain possessed blpc, which encodes the 30-mer qs pheromone. to investigate if blpc regulates bacteriocin production in s. thermophilus b59671, an integrative vector was used to replace blpc with a gene encoding for kanamycin resistance and the resulting mutant did not inhibit the growth of pediococcus acidilactici. constitutive expression of blpc from a shuttle vector restored the  bacteriocin production, confirming the blp gene cluster is essential for bacteriocin activity in s. thermophilus b59671.

TI  == structural aspects of the interaction of dairy phages with their host bacteria.
AB  == knowledge of phage-host interactions at a fundamental level is central to the design of rational strategies for the development of phage-resistant strains that may be applied in industrial settings. phages infecting lactic acid bacteria, in  particular lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus, negatively impact on dairy fermentation processes with serious economic implications. in recent years a wealth of information on structural protein assembly and topology has become available relating to phages infecting escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and lactococcus lactis, which act as models for structural analyses of dairy phages. in this review, we explore the role of model tailed phages, such as t4 and spp1, in advancing our knowledge regarding interactions between dairy phages  and their hosts. furthermore, the potential of currently investigated dairy phages to in turn serve as model systems for this particular group of phages is discussed.

TI  == macedovicin, the second food-grade lantibiotic produced by streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198.
AB  == streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 was found to produce a second lantibiotic named macedovicin in addition to macedocin. macedovicin was purified to homogeneity and mass spectrometric analysis identified a peptide of approximately 3.4 kda. partial n-terminal sequence analysis and tandem mass spectrometry revealed that macedovicin was identical to bovicin hj50 and thermophilin 1277 produced by streptococcus bovis and streptococcus thermophilus, respectively. macedovicin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, several food spoilage species (e.g. clostridium spp.) and oral streptococci. we determined the complete biosynthetic gene cluster of macedovicin. even though the gene clusters  of macedovicin, thermophilin 1277 and bovicin hj50 were almost identical at the nucleotide level, there were important differences in their predicted genes and proteins. bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics were also found to be encoded by streptococcus suis strains sc84 and d12, enterococcus columbae plch2, clostridium perfringens jgs1721 and several bacillus strains. all these lantibiotics contained a number of conserved amino acids that may be important for their biosynthesis and activity, while phylogenetic analysis supported their dispersion by horizontal gene transfer. in conclusion, the production of multiple bacteriocins may enhance the bio-protective potential of s. macedonicus during food fermentation.

TI  == the susceptibility of streptococcus thermophilus 14085 to organic acid, simulated gastric juice, bile salt and disinfectant as influenced by cold shock treatment.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is a thermophilic lactic acid bacterium which is used  as the starter organism for the fermentation of yoghurt and some cheese. in the present study, s. thermophilus bcrc 14085 was subjected to cold shock treatment by exposure at 10 degrees c for 2 h. the effect of cold shock on the susceptibility of s. thermophilus in subsequent lethal stress environments such as simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0-3.0), bile solution (2.0%) and various organic acids (0.75 m, ph 3.5) including propionic, lactic, acetic, citric and tartaric acid was investigated. in addition, the survival of cold-shocked and non-shocked  s. thermophilus exposed to disinfectants, clidox-s and quatricide, were compared. results revealed that cold shock enhanced the tolerance of s. thermophilus in the presence of simulated gastric juice (ph 2.5 and 2.8), while in bile solution, the population increase of cold-shocked cells is higher than that of non-shocked cells after 12 h of incubation. furthermore, the susceptibility of s. thermophilus, regardless of cold shock, to organic acid varied with the kinds of  organic acid examined. the cold-shocked s. thermophilus showed a significantly less survival (p < 0.05) than that of the non-shocked cells when exposed to lactic or acetic acid. furthermore, cold shock reduced the survival of s. thermophilus when exposed to quatricide but not clidox-s.

TI  == analysis of microbial diversity on deli slicers using polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technologies.
AB  == cross-contamination of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria from food-contact surfaces to food products is a serious public health issue. bacteria may survive  and attach to food-contact surfaces by residual food components and/or background bacteria which may subsequently transfer to other food products. deli slicers, generally used for slicing ready-to-eat products, can serve as potential sources  for considerable bacterial transfer. the objective of this study was to assess the extent and distribution of microbial diversity of deli slicers by identification of pathogenic and background bacteria. slicer-swab samples were collected from restaurants in arkansas and texas in the united states. ten surface areas for each slicer were swabbed using sterile sponges. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was applied to investigate the fingerprint of samples, and each band was further identified by sequence analysis. pseudomonads  were identified as the dominant bacteria followed by enterobacteriaceae family, and lactic acid bacteria such as lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus were also found. bacterial distribution was similar for all surface  areas, while the blade guard exhibited the greatest diversity. this study provides a profile of the microbial ecology of slicers using dgge to develop more specific sanitation practices and to reduce cross-contamination during slicing.

TI  == phages of lactic acid bacteria: the role of genetics in understanding phage-host  interactions and their co-evolutionary processes.
AB  == dairy fermentations are among the oldest food processing applications, aimed at preservation and shelf-life extension through the use of lactic acid bacteria (lab) starter cultures, in particular strains of lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus spp. and leuconostoc spp. traditionally this was performed by continuous passaging of undefined cultures from a finished  fermentation to initiate the next fermentation. more recently, consumer demands on consistent and desired flavours and textures of dairy products have led to a more defined approach to such processes. dairy (starter) companies have responded to the need to define the nature and complexity of the starter culture mixes, and dairy fermentations are now frequently based on defined starter cultures of low complexity, where each starter component imparts specific technological properties that are desirable to the product. both mixed and defined starter culture approaches create the perfect environment for the proliferation of (bacterio)phages capable of infecting these lab. the repeated use of the same starter cultures in a single plant, coupled to the drive towards higher and consistent production levels, increases the risk and negative impact of phage infection. in this review we will discuss recent advances in tracking the adaptation of phages to the dairy industry, the advances in understanding lab phage-host interactions, including evolutionary and genomic aspects.

TI  == phage mutations in response to crispr diversification in a bacterial population.
AB  == interactions between bacteria and their coexisting phage populations impact evolution and can strongly influence biogeochemical processes in natural ecosystems. periodically, mutation or migration results in exposure of a host to  a phage to which it has no immunity; alternatively, a phage may be exposed to a host it cannot infect. to explore the processes by which coexisting, co-evolving  hosts and phage populations establish, we cultured streptococcus thermophilus dgcc7710 with phage 2972 and tracked crispr (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) diversification and host-phage co-evolution in a population derived from a colony that acquired initial crispr-encoded immunity. after 1 week of co-culturing, the coexisting host-phage populations were metagenomically characterized using 454 flx titanium sequencing. the evolved genomes were compared with reference genomes to identify newly incorporated spacers in s. thermophilus dgcc7710 and recently acquired single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in phage 2972. following phage exposure, acquisition of immune elements (spacers) led to a genetically diverse population with multiple subdominant strain lineages. phage mutations that circumvented three early immunization events were localized in the proto-spacer adjacent motif (pam) or near the pam end of the proto-spacer, suggesting a strong selective advantage for the phage that mutated in this region. the sequential fixation or near fixation of these single mutations indicates selection events so severe that single phage  genotypes ultimately gave rise to all surviving lineages and potentially carried  traits unrelated to immunity to fixation.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

AB  == background: soy milk is one of the common soy-based foods in asia. in this study  the effects of soy milk fermented with selected probiotics on nitric oxide (no)-mediated vascular relaxation factors in cell model systems were investigated. results: soy milk fermented with lactobacillus plantarum twk10 or streptococcus thermophilus bcrc 14085 for 48 h showed a greater transformation of glucoside isoflavones to aglycone isoflavones (p < 0.05). an increase in aglycone isoflavones in ethanol extracts from fermented soy milk stimulated no production  and endothelial no synthase (enos) activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. it also had a stimulating effect on superoxide anion scavenging and prostaglandin e(2) production. in addition, it enhanced mrna expression of the e-prostanoid 4 receptor in rat thoracic aorta smooth muscle cells. moreover, a small amount of o(2)(-) induced by water extracts from fermented soy milk at low  concentration (1 mg ml(-)(1)) increased the content of calcium ions and activated enos, thereby promoting no production and the coupling state of enos. conclusion: soy milk fermented with selected probiotics promotes the relaxation factors of vascular endothelial cells and can be applied in the development of functional foods.

TI  == fatty acid profile, trans-octadecenoic, alpha-linolenic and conjugated linoleic acid contents differing in certified organic and conventional probiotic fermented milks.
AB  == development of dairy organic probiotic fermented products is of great interest as they associate ecological practices and benefits of probiotic bacteria. as organic management practices of cow milk production allow modification of the fatty acid composition of milk (as compared to conventional milk), we studied the influence of the type of milk on some characteristics of fermented milks, such as acidification kinetics, bacterial counts and fatty acid content. conventional and organic probiotic fermented milks were produced using bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis hn019 in co-culture with streptococcus thermophilus ta040 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lb340. the use of organic milk led to a higher acidification rate and cultivability of lactobacillus bulgaricus. fatty  acids profile of organic fermented milks showed higher amounts of trans-octadecenoic acid (c18:1, 1.6 times) and polyunsaturated fatty acids, including cis-9 trans-11, c18:2 conjugated linoleic (cla-1.4 times), and alpha-linolenic acids (ala-1.6 times), as compared to conventional fermented milks. these higher levels were the result of both initial percentage in the milk and increase during acidification, with no further modification during storage. finally, use of bifidobacteria slightly increased cla relative content in the conventional fermented milks, after 7 days of storage at 4 degrees c, whereas no  difference was seen in organic fermented milks.

AB  == the yoghurt bacteria, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, are alleged to have beneficial effects on human health. the objective of this study was to characterise growth, biochemical activity and competitive behaviour of these two bacteria in vitro and in vivo. s. thermophilus lmd-9 and l. bulgaricus atcc 11842 growth and lactate production were monitored in different media and in the gastrointestinal tract (git) of germ-free rats. in  vitro, particularly in milk, s. thermophilus had a selective growth advantage over l. bulgaricus. the git of germ-free rats not supplemented with lactose was colonised by s. thermophilus but not by l. bulgaricus. both bacteria were able to colonise the git of germ-free rats supplemented with 45 g/l lactose in their drinking water. however, if germ-free rats were inoculated with a mixture of the  two bacteria and were supplemented with lactose, s. thermophilus rapidly and extensively colonised the git (1010 cfu/g faeces) at the expense of l. bulgaricus, which remained in most cases at levels <102 cfu/g faeces. s. thermophilus specifically produced l-lactate, while l. bulgaricus produced only d-lactate, both in vitro and in vivo. s. thermophilus showed competitive and growth advantage over l. bulgaricus in vitro as well as in vivo in the git of germ-free rats and, accordingly, l-lactate was the main lactate isomer produced.

TI  == cas9-crrna ribonucleoprotein complex mediates specific dna cleavage for adaptive  immunity in bacteria.
AB  == clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (crispr)/crispr-associated (cas) systems provide adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids in bacteria and archaea. the silencing of invading nucleic acids is executed by ribonucleoprotein complexes preloaded with small, interfering crispr rnas (crrnas) that act as guides for targeting and degradation of foreign nucleic acid. here, we demonstrate that the cas9-crrna complex of the  streptococcus thermophilus crispr3/cas system introduces in vitro a double-strand break at a specific site in dna containing a sequence complementary to crrna. dna cleavage is executed by cas9, which uses two distinct active sites, ruvc and hnh, to generate site-specific nicks on opposite dna strands. results demonstrate that the cas9-crrna complex functions as an rna-guided endonuclease with rna-directed  target sequence recognition and protein-mediated dna cleavage. these findings pave the way for engineering of universal programmable rna-guided dna endonucleases.

TI  == exopolysaccharides modify functional properties of whey protein concentrate.
AB  == the objective of this research was to produce whey protein concentrate (wpc) with modified functionality using exopolysaccharide- (eps) producing cultures. two different eps-producing cultures, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris jfr and streptococcus thermophilus, producing eps1 and eps2 respectively, were used in this study. one eps-nonproducing commercial cheese culture (dvs 850; chr. hansen, milwaukee, wi) was used as the control. reconstituted sweet whey powder was used  in this study to eliminate variations from fresh whey. cultures grown overnight in reconstituted wpc (10% wt/vol) were added, directly or after overnight cooling (cooled eps), at 2% (wt/vol) to 6% (wt/wt) solution of reconstituted whey. whey was then high-temperature, short-time pasteurized at 75 degrees c for 35s and ultrafiltered to a volume reduction factor of 5. ultrafiltered whey (retentate) was spray dried at inlet and outlet air temperatures of 200 and 90 degrees c, respectively, to obtain wpc. in general, the solubility of wpc was higher at ph 7 than at ph 3. whey protein concentrate containing eps2 exhibited higher protein solubility than did wpc containing no eps. also, the presence of eps in wpc decreased protein denaturation. the emulsifying ability of wpc containing eps was higher than that in control. addition of eps to wpc significantly enhanced its gelling ability. foam overrun and hydrophobicity of wpc were not affected by addition of eps. in conclusion, data obtained from this study show that eps modify wpc functionality. the extent of modification depends on the type of eps.  cooling of culture containing eps before its addition to whey further reduced wpc protein denaturation and increased its solubility at ph 7 and gel hardness.

TI  == protein domain repetition is enriched in streptococcal cell-surface proteins.
AB  == tandem repetition of domain in protein sequence occurs in all three domains of life. it creates protein diversity and adds functional complexity in organisms. in this work, we analyzed 52 streptococcal genomes and found 3748 proteins contained domain repeats. proteins not harboring domain repeats are significantly enriched in cytoplasm, whereas proteins with domain repeats are significantly enriched in cytoplasmic membrane, cell wall and extracellular locations. domain repetition occurs most frequently in s. pneumoniae and least in s. thermophilus and s. pyogenes. duf1542 is the highest repeated domain in a single protein, followed by rib, cw_binding_1, g5 and hemolysincabind. 3d structures of 24 repeat-containing proteins were predicted to investigate the structural and functional effect of domain repetition. several repeat-containing streptococcal cell surface proteins are known to be virulence-associated. surface-associated tandem domain-containing proteins without experimental functional characterization may be potentially involved in the pathogenesis of streptococci  and deserve further investigation.

AB  == yogurt starter cultures may consist of multiple strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (lb) and streptococcus thermophilus (st). conventional plating methods for monitoring lb and st levels during yogurt manufacture do not allow for quantification of individual strains. the objective  of the present work was to develop a quantitative pcr method for quantification of individual strains in a commercial yogurt starter culture. strain-specific primers were designed for 2 st strains (st dgcc7796 and st dgcc7710), 1 lb strain (dgcc4078), and 1 lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis strain (ll; dgcc4550). primers for the individual st and lb strains were designed to target unique dna sequences in clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats. primers  for ll were designed to target a putative mannitol-specific iibc component of the phosphotransferase system. following evaluation of primer specificity, standard curves relating cell number to cycle threshold were prepared for each strain individually and in combination in yogurt mix, and no significant differences in  the slopes were observed. strain balance data was collected for yogurt prepared at 41 and 43 degrees c to demonstrate the potential application of this method.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria isolated from chinese yogurts.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of 43 strains of lactic  acid bacteria, isolated from chinese yogurts made in different geographical areas, to 11 antibiotics (ampicillin, penicillin g, roxithromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, lincomycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, neomycin, and gentamycin). the 43 isolates (18 lactobacillus bulgaricus and 25 streptococcus thermophilus) were identified at species level and were typed by random amplified polymorphic dna analysis. thirty-five genotypically different strains were detected and their antimicrobial resistance  to 11 antibiotics was determined using the agar dilution method. widespread resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline, tetracyclines, lincomycin, streptomycin, neomycin, and gentamycin was found among the 35 strains tested. all of the strep. thermophilus strains tested were susceptible to penicillin g and roxithromycin, whereas 23.5 and 64.7% of lb. bulgaricus strains, respectively, were resistant. all of the strep. thermophilus and lb. bulgaricus strains were found to be resistant to kanamycin. the presence of the corresponding resistance genes in the resistant isolates was investigated through pcr, with the following genes detected: tet(m) in 1 lb. bulgaricus and 2 strep. thermophilus isolates, ant(6) in 2 lb. bulgaricus and 2 strep. thermophilus isolates, and aph(3')-iiia in 5 lb. bulgaricus and 2 strep. thermophilus isolates. the main threat associated with these bacteria is that they may transfer resistance genes to pathogenic bacteria, which has been a major cause of concern to human and animal health. to our knowledge, the aph(3')-iiia and ant(6) genes were found in lb. bulgaricus and strep. thermophilus for the first time. further investigations are required to analyze whether the genes identified in lb. bulgaricus and strep. thermophilus isolates might be horizontally transferred to other species.

TI  == cleavage of phage dna by the streptococcus thermophilus crispr3-cas system.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus, similar to other bacteria and archaea, has developed  defense mechanisms to protect cells against invasion by foreign nucleic acids, such as virus infections and plasmid transformations. one defense system recently described in these organisms is the crispr-cas system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats loci coupled to crispr-associated genes). two s. thermophilus crispr-cas systems, crispr1-cas and crispr3-cas, have been shown to actively block phage infection. the crispr1-cas system interferes by cleaving foreign dsdna entering the cell in a length-specific and orientation-dependant manner. here, we show that the s. thermophilus crispr3-cas  system acts by cleaving phage dsdna genomes at the same specific position inside  the targeted protospacer as observed with the crispr1-cas system. only one cleavage site was observed in all tested strains. moreover, we observed that the  crispr1-cas and crispr3-cas systems are compatible and, when both systems are present within the same cell, provide increased resistance against phage infection by both cleaving the invading dsdna. we also determined that overall phage resistance efficiency is correlated to the total number of newly acquired spacers in both crispr loci.

TI  == lactic acid production by streptococcus thermophilus alters clostridium difficile infection and in vitro toxin a production.
AB  == antibiotic treatment to treat specific infections has the potential to effectively target the offending microbe as well as other microbes that colonize  sites within a host. antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) is a classic example resulting from disruption of host microbial communities; 20% of patients with aad are likely to become colonized with clostridium difficile. restoration of a "normal" microbial community within the host using probiotic bacteria is one approach to circumvent aad and c. difficile infection. the goals of this study were to assess the interactions between streptococcus thermophilus, a potential probiotic organism and c. difficile using both in vitro and in vivo systems. exposure of c. difficile to filtered supernatants from s. thermophilus showed a dose-dependent, bactericidal effect due to lactic acid. additional studies show that levels of lactic acid (10 mm) that did not inhibit bacterial growth had the  potential to decrease tcda expression and tcda release into the extracellular milieu. in vivo, treatment with viable s. thermophilus significantly increased luminal levels of lactate in the cecum compared with uv-irradiated s. thermophilus. in the context of infection with c. difficile, mice treated with viable s. thermophilus exhibited 46% less weight loss compared with untreated controls; moreover, less pathology, diarrhea, and lower detectable toxin levels in cecal contents were evident more often in s. thermophillus treated mice. a significant, inverse correlation (spearman r = -0.942, p = 0.017) between the levels of luminal lactate and abundance of c. difficile were noted suggesting that lactate produced by s. thermophilus is a factor impacting the progression of c. difficile infection in the murine system.

TI  == human monocyte-derived dendritic cells from leukoreduction system chambers after  plateletpheresis are functional in an in vitro co-culture assay with intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == the dendritic cells (dc) found in the intestine are involved both in the maintenance of tolerance towards commensal microbiota, and in the generation of protective immune responses against pathogens, thus contributing to gut immune homeostasis. there is an increasing interest in the use of lactic acid bacteria (lab) as probiotics; among their beneficial effects we highlight the modulation of the immune system which is one of their fundamental properties. as these effects are strain-dependent, it is important to have in vitro systems that include dc and intestinal epithelial cells (iec), which are crucial for intestinal homeostasis, to identify candidates by means of bacterial screening. obtaining enough human cells, necessary to simultaneously test several bacteria,  is a major challenge for researchers. in this study we analyzed the usefulness of the cellular fraction retained in leukoreduction system chambers following plateletpheresis (pp) as a source of dc. we compared the capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) from buffy coats (bc) or pp to generate dc using a short differentiation protocol. the functionality of the dc obtained was analyzed in co-cultures together with intestinal epithelial ht-29 cells, stimulating with  lps alone or with two lab commonly used in the food industry, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii. dc surface markers cd86, hla-dr and cytokine production were measured. the behavior of dc derived from pp was similar to the behavior observed for dc derived from bc. when we tested the response of dc to bacteria, we found significant differences in cytokine secretion, especially for il-10, suggesting that the system has the ability to discriminate  lab with different immunomodulatory properties. we also found that dc derived from both sources displayed a similar ability to phagocyte bacteria. in conclusion, we hereby propose a modification of the two-day protocol for obtaining human dc previously described, using pp as an alternative source of pbmc, to be used in co-culture systems with iec. the novelty of this protocol is  the combination of the blood monocyte source with a simple and fast differentiation method to obtain dc, and their use in a combined culture with iec and lab to model microbial-host interaction. since the initial pp volume is ten times lower than that of bc, the use of pp minimizes biological residue generation and reagent consumption. in addition, monocyte-derived dc from pp were suitable for use in co-culture assays as a first screening step to study the immunomodulatory properties of lab.

TI  == identification, structural, and biochemical characterization of a group of large  csn2 proteins involved in crispr-mediated bacterial immunity.
AB  == many prokaryotic organisms acquire immunity against foreign genetic material by incorporating a short segment of foreign dna called spacer into chromosomal loci, termed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crisprs). the encoded rnas are processed into small fragments that guide the silencing of the invading genetic elements. the crispr-associated (cas) proteins are the main executioners of these processes. herein, we report the crystal structure of stu0660 of streptococcus thermophilus, a cas protein involved in the acquisition  of new spacers. by homotetramerization, stu0660 forms a central channel which is  decorated with basic amino acids and binds linear double-stranded dna (dsdna), but not circular dsdna. despite undetectably low sequence similarity, two n-terminal domains of stu0660 are similar to the entire structure of an enterococcus faecalis csn2 protein, which also forms a homotetramer and binds dsdna. thus, this work identifies a previously unknown group of stu0660-like csn2 proteins ( approximately 350 residues), which are larger than the known canonical csn2 proteins ( approximately 220 residues) by containing an extra c-terminal domain. the commonly present central channel in the two subgroups appears as a design to selectively interact with linear dsdna.

AB  == the effects of the expression of a small heat shock protein (shsp) gene from streptococcus thermophilus on stress resistance in lactococcus lactis under different environmental stresses were investigated in this study. pmg36e-shsp, an expression vector, was first constructed by inserting a shsp open reading frame (orf) cloned from s. thermophilus strain st-qc into pmg36e. then, a food-grade expression vector, pmg-shsp, was generated by deleting the erythromycin resistance gene from pmg36e-shsp. the transformation rate of pmg-shsp was comparable to that of pmg36e-shsp when each of these two vectors was introduced into l. lactis. these results demonstrated that the shsp orf could successfully used as a food-grade selection marker in both pmg-shsp and pmg36e-shsp. furthermore, the growth characteristics were almost the same between l. lactis ml23 transformants harboring pmg36e or pmg-shsp. the survival rate of l. lactis ml23 expressing the shsp orf were increased to 0.032%, 0.006%, 0.0027%, 0.03%, and 0.16% under the following environmental stresses: heat, acid, ethanol, bile salt and h2o2, respectively. these results indicated that the expression of the shsp gene in the food-grade vector pmg-shsp conferred resistance to environmental stresses without affecting the growth characteristics of l. lactis ml23.

AB  == the crispr/cas system, comprised of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats along with their associated (cas) proteins, protects bacteria and archaea from viral predation and invading nucleic acids. while the mechanism  of action for this acquired immunity is currently under investigation, the response of cas protein expression to phage infection has yet to be elucidated. in this study, we employed shotgun proteomics to measure the global proteome expression in a model system for studying the crispr/cas response in s. thermophilus dgcc7710 infected with phage 2972. host and viral proteins were simultaneously measured following inoculation at two different multiplicities of  infection and across various time points using two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. thirty-seven out of forty predicted viral proteins were detected, including all proteins of the structural virome and viral effector proteins. in total, 1,013 of 2,079 predicted s. thermophilus proteins were detected, facilitating the monitoring of host protein synthesis changes in response to virus infection. importantly, cas proteins from all four crispr loci in the s. thermophilus dgcc7710 genome were detected, including loci  previously thought to be inactive. many cas proteins were found to be constitutively expressed, but several demonstrated increased abundance following  infection, including the signature cas9 proteins from the crispr1 and crispr3 loci, which are key players in the interference phase of the crispr/cas response. altogether, these results provide novel insights into the proteomic response of s. thermophilus, specifically crispr-associated proteins, upon phage 2972 infection.

TI  == alternating access mechanism in the pot family of oligopeptide transporters.
AB  == short chain peptides are actively transported across membranes as an efficient route for dietary protein absorption and for maintaining cellular homeostasis. in mammals, peptide transport occurs via pept1 and pept2, which belong to the proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter, or pot family. the recent crystal structure of a bacterial pot transporter confirmed that they belong to the major  facilitator superfamily of secondary active transporters. despite the functional  characterization of pot family members in bacteria, fungi and mammals, a detailed model for peptide recognition and transport remains unavailable. in this study, we report the 3.3-a resolution crystal structure and functional characterization  of a pot family transporter from the bacterium streptococcus thermophilus. crystallized in an inward open conformation the structure identifies a hinge-like movement within the c-terminal half of the transporter that facilitates opening of an intracellular gate controlling access to a central peptide-binding site. our associated functional data support a model for peptide transport that highlights the importance of salt bridge interactions in orchestrating alternating access within the pot family.

TI  == short communication: effect of oxygen on symbiosis between lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) and streptococcus thermophilus are traditionally used for the manufacture of yogurt. it is said that a symbiotic relationship exists between strep. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus and this decreases fermentation time. it is well known that l. bulgaricus is stimulated by the formate produced by strep. thermophilus, and strep. thermophilus is stimulated by free amino acids and peptides liberated from milk proteins by l. bulgaricus in symbiotic fermentation. we found that acid production by starter culture lb81 composed of l. bulgaricus 2038 and strep. thermophilus 1131 was greatly accelerated by decreasing dissolved oxygen (do) to  almost 0 mg/kg in the yogurt mix (reduced dissolved oxygen fermentation) and that do interferes with the symbiotic relationship between l. bulgaricus 2038 and strep. thermophilus 1131. we attributed the acceleration of acid production of lb81 by reduced dissolved oxygen fermentation mainly to the acceleration of formate production and the suppression of acid production of lb81 by do mainly to the suppression of formate production.

AB  == the milk protein proteose peptone component 3 (pp3, also known as lactophorin) is a small phosphoglycoprotein, which is exclusively expressed in the lactating mammary gland. a 23-residue synthetic peptide (lactophoricin, lpcin s), corresponding to the c-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix of pp3, has previously been shown to permeabilize membranes and display antibacterial activity. lactophorin readily undergoes proteolytic cleavage in milk and during dairy processing, and it has been suggested that pp3-derived peptides are part of milk's endogenous defense system against bacteria. here, we report that a 26-residue c-terminal peptide (lpcin p) can be generated by trypsin proteolysis of pp3 and that structural and functional studies of lpcin p indicate that the peptide has antibacterial properties. the lpcin p showed alpha-helical structure  in both anionic and organic solvents, and the amount of alpha-helical structure was increased in the presence of lipid vesicles. oriented circular dichroism showed that lpcin p oriented parallel to the membrane surface. however, the peptide permeabilized calcein-containing vesicles efficiently. lpcin p displayed  antibacterial activity against streptococcus thermophilus, but not against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the pp3 full-length protein did not display the same properties, which could indicate that pp3 functions as a precursor protein that upon proteolysis, releases a bioactive antibacterial peptide.

AB  == the high nutritional value of whey makes it an interesting substrate for the development of fermented foods. the aim of this work was to evaluate the growth and proteolytic activity of sixty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria in whey to further formulate a starter culture for the development of fermented whey-based beverages. fermentations were performed at 37 degrees c for 24 h in 10 and 16% (w/v) reconstituted whey powder. cultivable populations, ph, and proteolytic activity (o-phthaldialdehyde test) were determined at 6 and 24 h incubation. hydrolysis of whey proteins was analysed by tricine sds-page. a principal component analysis (pca) was applied to evaluate the behaviour of strains. forty-six percent of the strains grew between 1 and 2 deltalog cfu/ml while 19% grew less than 0.9 deltalog cfu/ml in both reconstituted whey solutions. regarding the proteolytic activity, most of the lactobacilli released amino acids and small peptides during the first 6 h incubation while streptococci consumed the amino acids initially present in whey to sustain growth. whey proteins were degraded by the studied strains although to different extents. special attention  was paid to the main allergenic whey protein, beta-lactoglobulin, which was degraded the most by lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636 and lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 656. the strain variability observed and the pca applied in this study allowed selecting appropriate strains able to improve the nutritional characteristics (through amino group release and protein degradation) and storage (decrease in ph) of whey.

AB  == enterococci constitute a significant component of the lactic acid bacteria normally present in the intestinal microflora and include strains that produce bacteriocins. the genetic determinants for durancin gl in enterococcus durans 41d were identified on the 8347 bp plasmid pdgl1 by plasmid curing experiments. pdgl1 contained nine putative orfs, with orf1 and orf2 encoding plasmid replication proteins, and orf3 and orf6 showing high similarity to genes encoding mobilization proteins. the predicted protein encoded by orf4 showed 74 % identity to baca, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecalis. the deduced dura protein contained the conserved motif yygng, suggesting that durancin gl is a typical subclass iia bacteriocin. orf5 was shown to share 85 % identity to the immunity protein bacb of enterococcus faecalis. orf9 displayed 87 % sequence identity to a conserved hypothetical protein of unknown function. to further clarify the minimum requirement for durancin gl production, a 547 bp fragment containing the durab gene was fitted with the streptococcus thermophilus p(2201)  promoter and then subcloned and heterologously expressed in s. thermophilus st128. the result demonstrated that the cloned fragment contained all the genetic components required for durancin gl production.

TI  == effect of homogenization on the properties and microstructure of mozzarella cheese from buffalo milk.
AB  == background: the name pasta filata refers to a unique plasticizing and texturing treatments of the fresh curd in hot water that imparts to the finished cheese its characteristic fibrous structure and melting properties. mozzarella cheese made from standardized homogenized and non-homogenized buffalo milk with 3 and 1.5%fat. the effect of homogenization on rheological, microstructure and sensory  evaluation was carried out. material and methods: fresh raw buffalo milk and starter cultures of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were used. the coagulants were calf rennet powder (ha-la). standardized buffalo milk was homogenized at 25 kg/cm2 pressure after heating to  60 degrees c using homogenizer. milk and cheese were analysed. microstructure of  the cheese samples was investigated either with an application of transmission or scanning electron microscope. statistical analyses were applied on the obtained data. results: soluble nitrogen total volatile free fatty acids, soluble tyrosine and tryptophan increased with using homogenized milk and also, increased with relatively decrease in case of homogenized mozzarella cheese. meltability of mozzarella cheese increased with increasing the fat content and storage period and decrease with homogenization. mozzarella cheese firmness increased with homogenization and also, increased with progressing of storage period. flavour score, appearance and total score of mozzarella cheese increased with homogenization and storage period progress, while body and texture score decreased with homogenization and increased with storage period progress. microstructure of mozzarella cheese showed the low fat cheese tends to be harder, more crumbly and less smooth than normal. curd granule junctions were prominent in non-homogenized milk cheese. conclusion: homogenization of milk cheese caused  changes in the microstructure of the mozzarella cheese. microstructure studies of cheese revealed that cheese made from homogenized milk is smoother and has a finer texture than non-homogenized but is also, firmer and more elastic.

TI  == monitoring of the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == soy sauce is a traditional seasoning produced through the fermentation of soybeans and wheat using microbes. in this study, the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process were analyzed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). the bacterial dgge profile indicated that the bacterial microbes in the koji were weissella cibaria (weissella confusa, weissella kimchii, weissella salipiscis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus iners, or streptococcus thermophilus), staphylococcus gallinarum (or staphylococcus xylosus), and staphylococcus kloosii. in addition to these bacteria, tetragenococcus halophilus was also detected in the mash during lactic acid fermentation. the fungal dgge profile indicated that the fungal microbes in the koji were not only aspergillus oryzae but also several yeasts. in the mash, zygosaccharomyces rouxii appeared in the early fermentation stage, candida etchellsii (or candida nodaensis) and candida versatilis were detected at the middle fermentation stage, and candida etchellsii was detected at the mature fermentation stage. these results suggest that the microbial communities present during the soy sauce manufacturing process change drastically throughout its production. this is the first report to reveal the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process using a culture-independent method.

TI  == novel streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius variants harboring lactose metabolism genes homologous to streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) commonly associated with human and animal infections. we elucidated the lactose metabolism of s. infantarius subsp.  infantarius predominant in african fermented milk products. s. infantarius subsp. infantarius isolates (n = 192) were identified in 88% of spontaneously fermented  camel milk suusac samples (n = 24) from kenya and somalia at log(1)(0) 8.2-8.5 cfu ml(-)(1). african s. infantarius isolates excreted stoichiometric amounts of  galactose when grown on lactose, exhibiting a metabolism similar to streptococcus thermophilus and distinct from their type strain. african s. infantarius subsp. infantarius cj18 harbors a regular gal operon with 99.7-100% sequence identity to s. infantarius subsp. infantarius atcc baa-102(t) and a gal-lac operon with 91.7-97.6% sequence identity to s. thermophilus, absent in all sequenced sbsec strains analyzed. the expression and functionality of lacz was demonstrated in a  beta-galactosidase assay. the gal-lac operon was identified in 100% of investigated s. infantarius isolates (n = 46) from suusac samples and confirmed in malian fermented cow milk isolates. the african s. infantarius variant potentially evolved through horizontal gene transfer of an s. thermophilus-homologous lactose pathway. safety assessments are needed to identify any putative health risks of this novel s. infantarius variant.

TI  == the viability and intestinal epithelial cell adhesion of probiotic strain combination--in vitro study.
AB  == to be effective, probiotic bacteria must exhibit a number of functional characteristics, including the resistance to gastric acidity and the ability to adhere to the intestinal epithelium. in this study, we examined in vitro the viability of lactic acid bacteria (lab) combination after exposure to low ph, and the adhesion of lab to caco-2 cells during coincubation of 9 bacterial strains. to test bacterial viability, 6 commercially available products were incubated in  0.1 n hcl at ph 1.2 for 60 min. the greatest growth inhibition was noted for the  non-capsulated product containing the lactobacillus rhamnosus strain (log reduction of cfu = 6.4), and the best survival observed for the product containing 9 bacterial strains, equipped with a modern capsule made according to  the multi-resistant encapsulation technology (log reduction of cfu = 0.1). in the adhesion experiment, the combination of 9 bacterial strains was added to 17-day-old caco-2 cell culture for 90 min. the greatest efficiency of adhesion was observed for the inoculum containing 5.5x10(8) cfu/ml/9.6 cm(2) of caco-2 and the dose of probiotic bacteria of 190 cells per one caco-2 cell. as a result, approximately 157 bacterial cells adhered to one caco-2 cell. the results indicate that the combination of 9 bacterial strains in the examined product is characterized as highly adhesive.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == effect of chemico-physical parameters on the histidine decarboxylase (hdca) enzymatic activity in streptococcus thermophilus pri60.
AB  == in this study the activity of the histidine decarboxylase (hdca) of streptococcus thermophilus pri60 was determined during growth and in crude enzyme preparations  to evaluate its hazardousness in dairy products. the effect of different ph values, lactose availability, nacl concentration, and growth temperature on histamine production was evaluated in m17 medium during 168 h incubation. in each case, the production of histamine increased concomitantly with the cell number with a relatively small further rise during the stationary phase. in all cultures the maximum histamine levels were reached at the end of active growth. histamine  was detectable (10 to 55 mg/l) even when growth was strongly inhibited. the hdca  enzyme in crude cell-free extracts was mostly active at acidic ph values common in dairy products. nacl concentrations lower than 5% did not affect its activity. the enzyme was quite resistant to heat treatments resembling low pasteurization,  but was inactivated at 75 degrees c for 2 min. given the features of the enzyme studied, efforts must be dedicated to a thorough risk analysis and development of strategies to contrast the presence of histaminogenic s. thermophilus strains in  products from raw or mildly heat-treated milk. practical application: during its  growth streptococcus thermophilus can produce histamine over a wide range of conditions encountered in cheesemaking and cheese ripening. the histidine-decarboxylase is even more active in cell-free extract and histamine can be accumulated independently of cell viability.

TI  == molecular analysis of the glutamate decarboxylase locus in streptococcus thermophilus st110.
AB  == gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) is generated from glutamate by the action of glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad) and characterized by hypotensive, diuretic, and tranquilizing effects in humans and animals. the production of gaba by lactic acid starter bacteria would enhance the functionality of fermented dairy foods including cheeses and yogurt. the survey of 42 strains of the yogurt starter culture streptococcus thermophilus by pcr techniques indicated the presence of a  glutamate decarboxylase gene (gadb) in 16 strains. dna sequencing data indicated  that the gad/gaba antiporter locus (gadb/gadc) in gad(+) s. thermophilus strains  is flanked by transposase elements (5' and 3') and positioned between the luxs (5') and the hd-superfamily hydrolase genes (3'). the pcr amplification product of a ca. 2-kb genomic fragment that included the gadb and its putative promoter region was inserted into a shuttle vector, which was used to transform escherichia coli dh5alpha. subsequently, the recombinant plasmid pmeu5a-1/gadb (7.24 kb) was electrotransformed into the gad-negative strain s. thermophilus st128. the st128 transformants carrying the plasmid-encoded gadb produced functional gad enzyme as evidenced by the conversion of glutamate to gaba at a rate similar to strains with the gadb/gadc operon located on the chromosome. the  results demonstrated the potential to impart to non-gaba-producing strains of s.  thermophilus and other lactic acid bacteria the gad(+) phenotype that improves their appeal in possible applications in the development of health-promoting functional foods.

TI  == determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages collected from different regions of turkey by using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. in the culture-independent detection, 10 different species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analysis of the 16s rrna gene v3 region. among these species, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most dominant one in the kefir grains, while lactococcus  lactis was found to be significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. in the culture-dependent detection, the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16s rdna full-length sequencing. according to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated species were l. lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus kefiri, respectively. only 3 species, which are  l. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. this study  showed that the combination of both methods is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in kefir grains and kefir beverages. practical application: due to their artisan- and region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food products. therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable effects on the product characteristics artisan dairy products are a candidate source of such microorganisms. for this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions  of turkey were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular  methods.

TI  == properties of a putative cambialistic superoxide dismutase from the aerotolerant  bacterium streptococcus thermophilus strain lmg 18311.
AB  == the aerotolerance of the lactic - fermentative bacterium streptococcus thermophilus is mainly based on the key antioxidant function of superoxide dismutase (stsod). in this work, the comparison of recombinant stsod (rstsod) forms obtained from two different initiation triplets indicated that the enzyme from s. thermophilus strain lmg 18311 spans 201 residues. rstsod is organised as  a homodimer, even though protein aggregates are formed in concentrated solutions. the capability of binding and exchanging fe or mn in the active site classifies rstsod as a putative cambialistic enzyme; the moderate preference for iron is counteracted by a 1.5-fold higher activity measured for the mn-containing form. the enzyme is thermostable, being its half-inactivation time 10 min at 73.5 degrees c; the energetic parameters of the heat inactivation process are regulated by the level of mn cofactor. the effect of mn content on the rstsod sensitivity towards inhibitors and inactivators was also evaluated. sodium azide  acts as a weak inhibitor of rstsod and its mn content does not greatly affect this sensitivity. concerning the physiological inactivator hydrogen peroxide, the mn-enriched rstsod displays a great resistance; a moderate sensitivity is instead observed in the presence of a low mn content. contrary to hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxynitrite is a powerful inactivator, a behaviour enhanced in the mn-enriched enzyme. all these results were compared with the corresponding data previously reported for the cambialistic sod from the taxonomically related s. mutans. in s. thermophilus the regulation of the enzyme functions by the mn content appears less relevant with respect to s. mutans.

TI  == a survey of the bacterial composition of kurut from tibet using a culture-independent approach.
AB  == kurut (fermented yak milk) made by natural fermentation is a very important dairy food for the local people in tibet (china). it is important to fully understand the bacterial composition of kurut for quality improvement and industrial production. because more than 99% of prokaryotes cannot be cultured and identified by methods currently used in taxonomy, we applied a culture-independent approach to explore the microbial biodiversity of this traditional food. in this study, a bacterial 16s rrna gene clone library, including 460 clones, was constructed using total dna extracted from 30 samples of kurut. after screening by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis, 56 operational taxonomic units (otu) with unique rflp patterns were obtained. then, 1 representative sequence of every otu was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. the representative phylotypes were affiliated with 5 groups, including lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and acetobacter. in addition, nearly one-third of the representative clones (132 clones) had low similarity to species in genbank (<97%), and these phylotypes were regarded as unknown bacteria. the characteristics of kurut are determined not only by lactic acid bacteria well known by the culture-dependent approach but also by bacteria that have not yet been identified.

TI  == development of marine probiotics: prospects and approach.
AB  == the term probiotics stands for bacterial strain acting for the upliftment of beneficial gut microflora as well as restricting the growth of decay or disease causing bacteria and other agents. they protect us from disease causing microorganisms and are vital for the digestion of nutrients and food. researchers are now trying to explore the possibilities of therapeutic applications of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease, treating diarrhea, eczema prevention in children, and reducing bladder cancer recurrence and urinary tract infections. the best known probiotic strains are bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococcus thermophilus and can be found in food products such as yoghurts, fermented and unfermented milk, miso, tempeh, and some juices and soy beverages.  thus, as a substitute to the use of antibiotics, the dietary supplementation with probiotic bacteria is being widely employed in the aquaculture industry. this chapter is an attempt to shift the paradigm of research in probiotic area to the  marine environment and to find ways of expanding the research in marine probiotics development.

TI  == improved acid stress survival of lactococcus lactis expressing the histidine decarboxylation pathway of streptococcus thermophilus chcc1524.
AB  == degradative amino acid decarboxylation pathways in bacteria generate secondary metabolic energy and provide resistance against acid stress. the histidine decarboxylation pathway of streptococcus thermophilus chcc1524 was functionally expressed in the heterologous host lactococcus lactis nz9000, and the benefits of the newly acquired pathway for the host were analyzed. during growth in m17 medium in the ph range of 5-6.5, a small positive effect was observed on the biomass yield in batch culture, whereas no growth rate enhancement was evident. in contrast, a strong benefit for the engineered l. lactis strain was observed in acid stress survival. in the presence of histidine, the pathway enabled cells to  survive at ph values as low as 3 for at least 2 h, conditions under which the host cells were rapidly dying. the flux through the histidine decarboxylation pathway in cells grown at physiological ph was under strict control of the electrochemical proton gradient (pmf) across the membrane. ionophores that dissipated the membrane potential (deltapsi) and/or the ph gradient (deltaph) strongly increased the flux, whereas the presence of glucose almost completely inhibited the flux. control of the pmf over the flux was exerted by both deltapsi and deltaph and was distributed over the transporter hdcp and the decarboxylase hdca. the control allowed for a synergistic effect between the histidine decarboxylation and glycolytic pathways in acid stress survival. in a narrow ph range around 2.5 the synergism resulted in a 10-fold higher survival rate.

TI  == quantitative proteomic analysis of bacterial enzymes released in cheese during ripening.
AB  == due to increasingly available bacterial genomes in databases, proteomic tools have recently been used to screen proteins expressed by micro-organisms in food in order to better understand their metabolism in situ. while the main objective  is the systematic identification of proteins, the next step will be to bridge the gap between identification and quantification of these proteins. for that purpose, a new mass spectrometry-based approach was applied, using isobaric tagging reagent for quantitative proteomic analysis (itraq), which are amine specific and yield labelled peptides identical in mass. experimental swiss-type cheeses were manufactured from microfiltered milk using streptococcus thermophilus itg st20 and lactobacillus helveticus itg lh1 as lactic acid starters. at three ripening times (7, 20 and 69 days), cheese aqueous phases were extracted and enriched in bacterial proteins by fractionation. each sample, standardised in protein amount prior to proteomic analyses, was: i) analysed by 2d-electrophoresis for qualitative analysis and ii) submitted to trypsinolysis, and labelled with specific itraq tag, one per ripening time. the three labelled samples were mixed together and analysed by nano-lc coupled on-line with esi-qtof mass spectrometer. thirty proteins, both from bacterial or bovine origin, were identified and efficiently quantified. the free bacterial proteins detected were  enzymes from the central carbon metabolism as well as stress proteins. depending  on the protein considered, the quantity of these proteins in the cheese aqueous extract increased from 2.5 to 20 fold in concentration from day 7 to day 69 of ripening.

AB  == in streptococcus thermophilus, the comrs regulatory system governs the transcriptional level of comx expression and, hence, controls the early stage of  competence development. the present work focuses on the posttranslational control of the activity of the sigma factor comx and, therefore, on the late stage of competence regulation. in silico analysis performed on the s. thermophilus genome revealed the presence of a homolog of meca (meca(st)), which codes for the adaptor protein that is involved in comk degradation by clpcp in bacillus subtilis. using reporter strains and microarray experiments, we showed that meca(st) represses late competence genes without affecting the early competence stage under conditions that are not permissive for competence development. in addition, this repression mechanism was found not only to act downstream of comx  expression but also to be fully dependent on the presence of a functional comx gene. this negative control was similarly released in strains deleted for clpc, meca, and clpc-meca. under artificial conditions of comx expression, we next showed that the abundance of comx is higher in the absence of meca or clpc. finally, results of bacterial two-hybrid assays strongly suggested that meca interacts with both comx and clpc. based on these results, we proposed that clpc  and meca act together in the same regulatory circuit to control the abundance of  comx in s. thermophilus.

TI  == biology and genome sequence of streptococcus mutans phage m102ad.
AB  == m102ad is the new designation for a streptococcus mutans phage described in 1993  as phage m102. this change was necessitated by the genome analysis of another s.  mutans phage named m102, which revealed differences from the genome sequence reported here. additional host range analyses confirmed that s. mutans phage m102ad infects only a few serotype c strains. phage m102ad adsorbed very slowly to its host, and it cannot adsorb to serotype e and f strains of s. mutans. m102ad adsorption was blocked by c-specific antiserum. phage m102ad also adsorbed equally well to heat-treated and trypsin-treated cells, suggesting carbohydrate receptors. saliva and polysaccharide production did not inhibit plaque formation. the genome of this siphophage consisted of a linear, double-stranded, 30,664-bp dna molecule, with a gc content of 39.6%. analysis of the genome extremities indicated the presence of a 3'-overhang cos site that was 11 nucleotides long. bioinformatic analyses identified 40 open reading frames, all in the same orientation. no lysogeny-related genes were found, indicating that phage m102ad is strictly virulent. no obvious virulence factor gene candidates were found. twelve proteins were identified in the virion structure by mass spectrometry. comparative genomic analysis revealed a close relationship between s. mutans phages m102ad and m102 as well as with streptococcus thermophilus phages. this study also highlights the importance of conducting research with biological materials obtained from recognized microbial collections.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == deletion of the murein hydrolase cbpd reduces transformation efficiency in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == recently it has been shown that streptococcus thermophilus is competent for natural genetic transformation. this property is widespread among streptococci and may include all members of the genus. upon entering the competent state, streptococci start transcribing a number of competence-specific genes whose products are required for binding, uptake and processing of transforming dna. in  addition to the core competence genes, competent streptococci express a number of accessory genes that are dispensable for transformation in the laboratory, but presumably play an important role under natural conditions. in streptococcus pneumoniae, one of these accessory genes encodes a competence-specific murein hydrolase termed cbpd. experimental evidence indicates that pneumococcal cbpd is  part of a predatory mechanism that lyses noncompetent sister cells or members of  closely related species in order to release homologous dna that can be taken up by the competent attacker cells. competent s. thermophilus lmg18311 cells produce a cbpd-like protein, stu0039, which might have the same or a similar function. in the present study we have characterized this protein and shown that it is a murein hydrolase with a novel type of cell surface-binding domain. furthermore, we show that stu0039 is rapidly inactivated by h(2)o(2) produced during aerobic growth of s. thermophilus. we propose that this inactivation mechanism has evolved for self-protection purposes to prevent extensive autolysis in a competent population. interestingly, in contrast to pneumococcal cbpd, which does not affect the transformation properties of the producer strain, deletion of stu0039 reduces the transformability of s. thermophilus.

TI  == cytokine profile and induction of t helper type 17 and regulatory t cells by human peripheral mononuclear cells after microbial exposure.
AB  == the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics were assessed following exposure of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), cord blood cells and the spleen-derived monocyte/macrophage cell line crl-9850 to lactobacillus acidophilus lavri-a1, lb. rhamnosus gg, exopolysaccharides (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus st1275, bifidobacteriun longum bl536, b. lactis b94 and escherichia coli tg1 strains. the production of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by pbmc following bacterial stimulation was measured, using live, heat-killed or mock gastrointestinal tract (git)-exposed bacteria, and results show that (i) all bacterial strains investigated induced significant  secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from pbmc-derived monocytes/macrophages; and (ii) cytokine levels increased relative to the expansion of bacterial cell numbers over time for cells exposed to live cultures. bifidobacteria and s. thermophilus stimulated significant concentrations of transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta, an interleukin necessary for the differentiation of regulatory t cells (t(reg) )/t helper type 17 (th17) cells and, as such, the study further examined the induction of th17 and t(reg) cells after pbmc exposure to selected bacteria for 96 h. data show a significant increase in the numbers of both cell types in the exposed populations, measured by cell surface marker expression and by cytokine production. probiotics have been shown to induce cytokines from a range of immune cells following ingestion of these organisms. these studies suggest that probiotics' interaction with immune-competent cells produces a cytokine milieu, exerting immunomodulatory effects on local effector cells, as well as potently inducing differentiation of  th17 and t(reg) cells.

TI  == the influence of selected prebiotics on the growth of lactic acid bacteria for bio-yoghurt production.
AB  == background: prebiotics are a category of nutritional com-pounds grouped together, not necessarily by structural similarities, but by ability to promote the growth  of spe-cific beneficial (probiotic) gut bacteria. fructooligosaccharides (fos) and inulin are among the most famous prebiotic compounds. in order to improve viability of probiotic bacteria during storage, fermented food should be supplemented with prebiotics. material and methods: yoghurts were produced from skimmed milk powder and prebiotics (fos, inulin or resistant starch), which were  added at concentrations of 1%, 2% and 3%. yoghurts were stored in +4 degrees c for three weeks. every week each kind of fermented drink was examined in order to check the growth of lactic acid bacteria. apparent viscosity and texture of bio-yoghurt were determinated during refrigerated storage. results: the fos and inulin addition to yoghurt caused an increase in the numbers of all bacteria in comparison to control yoghurt obtained without addition of prebiotics. the viable counts of str. thermophilus, lb. acidophilus and bifidobacterium sp. when 1% of fos was added to yoghurt were about 9 log cfu/g, 7.8 log cfu/g and 7.7 log cfu/g, respectively. in the presence of 1% of inulin, streptococci and bifidobacteria reached the growth at the level 8.8 log cfu/g and 7.5 respectively. hardness and  adhesiveness of yoghurt obtained with addition resistant starch increased systematically during 21 days of refrigerated storage. conclusions: the numbers of lactic acid bacteria in obtained bio-yoghurts were sufficient in 97% of samples (10(6)-10(9) cfu/g) according to fao/who protocols. generally, viability  of bacteria was sufficient for 14 days and then their numbers decreased but usually not below 10(6) cfu/g. prebiotics as fos and inulin added to bio-yoghurt  exhibited stimulatory effect on growth lb. acidophilus and bifidobacterium sp. addition of prebiotics caused an increase in apparent viscosity and hardness (in  case of fos) and decrease in syneresis of obtained bio-yoghurts.

TI  == carbohydrate metabolism is essential for the colonization of streptococcus thermophilus in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is the archetype of lactose-adapted bacterium and so far, its sugar metabolism has been mainly investigated in vitro. the objective of this work was to study the impact of lactose and lactose permease on s. thermophilus physiology in the gastrointestinal tract (git) of gnotobiotic rats.  we used rats mono-associated with lmd-9 strain and receiving 4.5% lactose. this model allowed the analysis of colonization curves of lmd-9, its metabolic profile, its production of lactate and its interaction with the colon epithelium. lactose induced a rapid and high level of s. thermophilus in the git, where its activity led to 49 mm of intra-luminal l-lactate that was related to the induction of mono-carboxylic transporter mrnas (slc16a1 and slc5a8) and p27(kip1) cell cycle arrest protein in epithelial cells. in the presence of a continuous lactose supply, s. thermophilus recruited proteins involved in glycolysis and induced the metabolism of alternative sugars as sucrose, galactose, and glycogen. moreover, inactivation of the lactose transporter, lacs, delayed s. thermophilus  colonization. our results show i/that lactose constitutes a limiting factor for colonization of s. thermophilus, ii/that activation of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism constitutes the metabolic signature of s. thermophilus in the git, iii/that the production of lactate settles the dialogue with colon epithelium. we propose a metabolic model of management of carbohydrate resources  by s. thermophilus in the git. our results are in accord with the rationale that  nutritional allegation via consumption of yogurt alleviates the symptoms of lactose intolerance.

TI  == production of volatile compounds in reconstituted milk reduced-fat cheese and the physicochemical properties as affected by exopolysaccharide-producing strain.
AB  == the application of the exopolysaccharide-producing strains for improving the texture and technical properties of reduced-fat cheese looks very promising. streptococcus thermophilus tm11 was evaluated for production of reduced-fat cheese using reconstituted milk powder (crmp). the physicochemical analysis of fresh and stored cheeses showed that this strain slightly increased moisture content resulting in cheese with higher yield and lower protein content compared  to the direct acidified cheese. the volatiles of cheese were determined by spme and gc equipped with a mass spectrometer. the results indicated that the major compounds included aldehydes, ketones and acids, whereas, alcohols and branched-chain aldehydes that contribute to exciting and harsh flavors were not found in crmp. by the textural profile analysis, we found the cheese made with s. thermophilus tm11 had lower cohesiveness, resilience and higher adhesiveness than the direct acidified cheese, and had similar hardness. further, s. thermophilus tm11 greatly changed the protein matrix with more opened cavities according to observation by scanning electron microscopy. consequently, use of s. thermophilus tm11 could endow crmp with the novel and suitable flavor properties and improved  texture quality.

TI  == selenium-enriched probiotics improves murine male fertility compromised by high fat diet.
AB  == a total of 75 male mice were allotted to five groups of 15 each in a completely randomized experimental design to study the effects of probiotics, inorganic selenium, and selenium-enriched probiotics on male fertility in hyperlipidemic status. the mice in group 1 were fed a normal basal diet and served as negative control. the mice in group 2 were fed a high fat diet and served as positive control. the mice in groups 3, 4, and 5 were fed the high fat diet supplemented with probiotics, inorganic selenium, and selenium-enriched probiotics, respectively. the high fat diet was composed of 15% lard, 1% cholesterol, 0.3% cholic acid, and 83.7% basal diet. over 90% of the selenium in the selenium-enriched probiotics was present in forms of organic selenium. after the  mice were fed these diets for 75 days, serumal total cholesterol, triglycerides,  low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, and testosterone levels, plus  sperm index (count, motility and abnormalities), penis length, and weight and histopathology of testes were measured. the results showed that in the mice fed the high fat diet were significant (p < 0.01) elevations of serumal total cholesterol, triglycerides and low density lipoprotein, and decreases of high density lipoprotein. the high fat diet caused a decline in serumal testosterone level, reduced semen quality, and atrophy and degeneration of seminiferous tubules. no effects on penis length or relative weight of testis were observed. supplementation of probiotics, inorganic selenium, or selenium-enriched probiotics to the high fat diet significantly alleviated (p < 0.05) the adverse effects of hyperlipidemia by reducing testicular tissue injury, increasing serumal testosterone level, and improving sperm indexes. it was concluded that hyperlipidemia had significant adverse effects on male fertility, which could be  ameliorated at various degrees by feeding the diets supplemented with probiotics, inorganic selenium, or selenium-enriched probiotics. selenium-enriched probiotics or inorganic selenium supplementation gave better results than probiotics supplementation and may be used to improve animal and human male fertility compromised by hyperlipidemia or obesity.

AB  == the purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rdna and cdna. furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on  survival of added escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr. a high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. bacteria belonging to the genera brevibacterium, staphylococcus, escherichia, weissella, leuconostoc, pediococcus were also detected in both 16s rdna and cdna obtained from raw milk and cheeses. e. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both dna and rna extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. growth of e. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification  but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of  raw milk. growth of l. innocua and s. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all  cheeses at different stages of ripening. the use of 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing  and qrt-pcr allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.

TI  == the structure of an n11a mutant of the g-protein domain of feob.
AB  == the uptake of ferrous iron in prokaryotes is mediated by the g-protein-coupled membrane protein feob. the protein contains two n-terminal soluble domains that are together called `nfeob'. one of these is a g-protein domain, and gtp hydrolysis by this domain is essential for iron transport. the gtpase activity of nfeob is accelerated in the presence of potassium ions, which bind at a site adjacent to the nucleotide. one of the ligands at the potassium-binding site is a conserved asparagine residue, which corresponds to asn11 in streptococcus thermophilus nfeob. the structure of an n11a s. thermophilus nfeob mutant has been determined and refined to a resolution of 1.85 a; the crystals contained a mixture of mant-gdp-bound and mant-gmp-bound protein. the structure demonstrates  how the use of a derivatized nucleotide in cocrystallization experiments can facilitate the growth of diffraction-quality crystals.

AB  == using the yeast two-hybrid system, intraspecific protein interactions were detected in streptococcus iniae and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris between the transmembrane activation protein (cpsc and epsa, respectively) and the protein tyrosine kinase (cpsd and epsb, respectively), between two protein tyrosine kinases, and between the protein tyrosine kinase and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase (cpsb and epsc, respectively). for each of these intraspecific interactions, interspecific interactions were also detected when one protein was  from s. iniae and the other was from streptococcus thermophilus . interactions were also observed between two protein tyrosine kinases when one protein was from either of the streptococcus species and the other from l. lactis subsp. cremoris. the results and sequence comparisons performed in this study support the conclusion that interactions among the components of the tyrosine kinase - phosphatase regulatory system are conserved in the order lactobacillales and that interspecific genetic exchanges of the genes that encode these proteins have the  potential to form functional recombinants. a better understanding of intraspecific and interspecific protein interactions involved in regulating exopolysaccharide biosynthesis may facilitate construction of improved strains for industrial uses as well as identification of factors needed to form functional regulatory complexes in naturally occurring recombinants.

AB  == milk proteins contain numerous potential bioactive peptides, which may be released by digestive proteases or by the proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria during food processing. the capacity of streptococcus thermophilus to generate peptides, especially bioactive peptides, from bovine caseins was investigated. strains expressing various levels of the cell envelope proteinase,  prts, were incubated with alpha(s1)-, alpha(s2)-, or beta-casein. analysis of the supernatants by lc-esi-ms/ms showed that the beta-casein was preferentially hydrolyzed, followed by alpha(s2)-casein and then alpha(s1)-casein. numbers and types of peptides released were strain-dependent. hydrolysis appeared to be linked with the accessibility of different casein regions by protease. analysis of bonds hydrolyzed in the region 1-23 of alpha(s1)-casein suggests that prts is  at least in part responsible for the peptide production. finally, among the generated peptides, 13 peptides from beta-casein, 5 from alpha(s2)-casein, and 2  from alpha(s1)-casein have been reported as bioactive, 15 of them being angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

AB  == the acquisition of ferrous iron in prokaryotes is achieved by the g-protein-coupled membrane protein feob. this protein possesses a large c-terminal membrane-spanning domain preceded by two soluble cytoplasmic domains that are together termed 'nfeob'. the first of these soluble domains is a gtpase  domain (g-domain), which is then followed by an entirely alpha-helical domain. gtp hydrolysis by the g-domain is essential for iron uptake by feob, and various  nfeob mutant proteins from streptococcus thermophilus have been constructed. these mutations investigate the role of conserved amino acids from the protein's  critical switch regions. five crystal structures of these mutant proteins have been determined. the structures of e66a and e67a mutant proteins were solved in complex with nonhydrolyzable gtp analogues, the structures of t35a and e67a mutant proteins were solved in complex with gdp and finally the structure of the  t35s mutant was crystallized without bound nucleotide. as an ensemble, the structures illustrate how small nucleotide-dependent rearrangements at the active site are converted into large rigid-body reorientations of the helical domain in  response to gtp binding and hydrolysis. this provides the first evidence of nucleotide-dependent helical domain movement in nfeob proteins, suggesting a mechanism by which the g-protein domain could structurally communicate with the membrane domain and mediate iron uptake.

TI  == effect of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on lipid profiles in pregnant women: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: due to enhanced fat storage primarily during the mid-pregnancy period, pregnancy is associated with elevated levels of lipid profiles. to our knowledge, no reports are available indicating the effects of probiotic yoghurt consumption on serum lipid profiles in pregnant women. objective: this study was  designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on lipid profiles of iranian pregnant women. methods: this randomized single-blinded controlled clinical trial was performed among 70 pregnant women, primigravida, aged 18-30 years old who were carrying singleton pregnancy at their third trimester. subjects were randomly assigned to consume 200 g/d of conventional (n=33) or the probiotic group (n=37) for 9 weeks. the probiotic yoghurt was a commercially available product prepared with the starter cultures of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, enriched with probiotic  culture of two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus la5) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis bb12) with a total of min 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units. the conventional yoghurt contained the starter cultures of  s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 9-weeks intervention to measure serum lipid profiles. results: although consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks had been resulted in a significant reduction in serum total- (-53.7 mg/dl, p=0.001), ldl- (-35.2 mg/dl, p=0.006) and hdl-cholesterol levels (-9.8 mg/dl, p=0.002) as well as serum triglyceride concentrations (-42.8 mg/dl, p=0.029), no significant differences were found comparing probiotic and conventional yogurts in terms of their effect on serum lipid profiles. within-group differences in conventional yogurt group revealed a  significant reduction in hdl-cholesterol levels (-8.4 mg/dl, p=0.005) and borderline significant reduction in serum total cholesterol concentrations (-21.6 mg/dl, p=0.08). conclusion: in conclusion, consumption of probiotic yogurt among  pregnant women could not affect serum lipid profiles as compared to the conventional yogurt.

TI  == probiotics can induce follicle maturational competence: the danio rerio case.
AB  == in the present study, the effects of the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus imc 501 on the acquisition of oocyte maturational competence was examined in zebrafish (danio rerio). l. rhamnosus administration induced the responsiveness of incompetent follicles (stage iiia) to 17,20-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one and their in vitro maturation. acquisition of competence by the stage iiia follicles  was further validated by changes of lhr, mprb, inhbaa (activin betaa1), tgfb1, and gdf9 gene expression, which have recently emerged as key regulators of oocyte acquisition of maturational competence, and pou5f1 gene expression, which in other models has been shown to govern the establishment of developmental competence of oocytes. in addition, a dna microarray experiment was conducted using the same follicles, and with relative gene ontology (go) data analysis, the molecular effects of probiotic administration emerged. molecular analysis using pcr-dgge (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) approach, providing information about only the most abundant bacterial members of the microbial community, revealed that the probiotic was able to populate the gastrointestinal  tract and modulate the microbial communities, causing a clear shift in them and specifically enhancing the presence of the lactic acid bacteria streptococcus thermophilus. at the same time, pcr-dgge analysis revealed that the probiotic was not directly associated with the ovaries. finally, the effects of probiotic treatment on zebrafish follicle development were also analyzed by fpa (focal plane array) fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) imaging, a technique that provides the overall biochemical composition of samples. changes were found above all in stage iiia follicles from probiotic-exposed females; the modifications, observed in protein secondary structures as well as in hydration and in bands related to phosphate moieties, allowed us to hypothesize that probiotics act at this follicle stage, affecting the maturation phase.

TI  == a newly established bovine intestinal epithelial cell line is effective for in vitro screening of potential antiviral immunobiotic microorganisms for cattle.
AB  == we evaluated whether a bovine intestinal epithelial (bie) cell line could serve as a useful in vitro model system for studying antiviral immune responses in bovine intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) and for the primary screening of immunobiotic microorganisms with antiviral protective capabilities. immunofluorescent analyses revealed that toll-like receptor 3 (tlr3) was expressed in bie cells, and the results of real-time quantitative pcr showed that these cells respond to stimulation with poly(i:c) by up-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and type i interferons. in addition, we demonstrated that bie cells are useful for the primary screening of immunobiotic lactic acid bacteria strains which are able to beneficially modulate antiviral immune responses triggered by tlr3 activation in bovine iecs. the characterization of bie cells performed in the present study represents an important step towards the establishment of a valuable bovine in vitro system that could be used for the development of immunomodulatory feed for bovine hosts.

TI  == identification and characterisation of an iron-responsive candidate probiotic.
AB  == background: iron is an essential cofactor in almost all biological systems. the lactic acid bacteria (lab), frequently employed as probiotics, are unusual in having little or no requirement for iron. iron in the human body is sequestered by transferrins and lactoferrin, limiting bacterial growth. an increase in the availability of iron in the intestine by bleeding, surgery, or under stress leads to an increase in the growth and virulence of many pathogens. under these high iron conditions, lab are rapidly out-competed; for the levels of probiotic bacteria to be maintained under high iron conditions they must be able to respond by increasing growth rate to compete with the normal flora. despite this, iron-responsive genera are poorly characterised as probiotics. methodology/principal findings: here, we show that a panel of probiotics are not  able to respond to increased iron availability, and identify an isolate of streptococcus thermophilus that can increase growth rate in response to increased iron availability. the isolate of s. thermophilus selected was able to reduce epithelial cell death as well as nf-kappab signalling and il-8 production triggered by pathogens. it was capable of crossing an epithelial cell barrier in  conjunction with e. coli and downregulating th1 and th17 responses in primary human intestinal leukocytes. conclusions/significance: we propose that an inability to compete with potential pathogens under conditions of high iron availability such as stress and trauma may contribute to the lack of efficacy of  many lab-based probiotics in treating disease. therefore, we offer an alternative paradigm which considers that probiotics should be able to be competitive during  periods of intestinal bleeding, trauma or stress.

TI  == the impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins.
AB  == understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are affected by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks before, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks after consumption of a commercially available fermented milk product (fmp) containing a consortium of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris,  and streptococcus thermophilus. in addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied before and after gavage with all five sequenced fmp strains. no significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed  in the feces of humans consuming the fmp. only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice after single or repeated gavage with the fmp consortium. however, rna-seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the fmp strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. b. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the fmp consortium in gnotobiotic mice, up-regulates a locus in vivo that is involved in the catabolism of xylooligosaccharides, a class of glycans widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other foods, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this bacterial species. the human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of fmp consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to  plant polysaccharide metabolism. these experiments illustrate a translational research pipeline for characterizing the effects of fmps on the human gut microbiome.

TI  == reverse transcription quantitative pcr revealed persistency of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria metabolic activity until the end of the ripening of emmental cheese.
AB  == for emmental manufacture two kinds of adjunct culture are added: (i) thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (starters) such as lactobacillus helveticus (lh), and streptococcus thermophilus (st) growing the first day of the manufacture and (ii) ripening culture. st and lh have a key role in curd acidification and proteolysis at the beginning of the manufacture but are considered to be lyzed for a great part of them at the ripening step. the aim of this work was to assess the metabolic activity of these bacteria throughout manufacture and ripening. during  emmental cheesemaking, lh and st were subjected to i) population quantification by numerations and by quantitative pcr (qpcr) ii) reverse transcription (rt) temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge) iii) transcript quantification by rt-qpcr targeting 16s rrna, tuf and grol mrnas to evaluate bacterial metabolic activity. during ripening, st and lh numerations showed a 2.5 log(10) loss of culturability whereas qpcr on pelleted cells revealed only one log(10) of decrease for both of these species. 10(9) st and 10(8) lh cells/g of cheese still remained. they contained a stable number of 16s transcript and at least 10(6) copies of mrnas per 10(9) cells until the end of ripening. these results prove the unexpected persistency of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria starters (st and  lh) metabolic activity until the end of ripening and open new perspectives in term of their involvement in the quality of cheeses during ripening.

TI  == differential regulation of two closely related integrative and conjugative elements from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == background: two closely related ices, icest1 and icest3, have been identified in  the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus. while their conjugation and recombination modules are almost identical (95% nucleotide identity) and their regulation modules related, previous work has demonstrated that transconjugants carrying icest3 were generated at rate exceeding by a 1000 factor that of icest1. results: the functional regulation of icest1 and icest3 transcription, excision and replication were investigated under different conditions (exponential growth  or stationary phase, dna damage by exposition to mitomycin c). analysis revealed  an identical transcriptional organization of their recombination and conjugation  modules (long unique transcript) whereas the transcriptional organization of their regulation modules were found to be different (two operons in icest1 but only one in icest3) and to depend on the conditions (promoter specific of stationary phase in icest3). for both elements, stationary phase and dna damage lead to the rise of transcript levels of the conjugation-recombination and regulation modules. whatever the growth culture conditions, excision of icest1 was found to be lower than that of icest3, which is consistent with weaker transfer frequencies. furthermore, for both elements, excision increases in stationary phase (8.9-fold for icest1 and 1.31-fold for icest3) and is strongly enhanced by dna damage (38-fold for icest1 and 18-fold for icest3). although ices are generally not described as replicative elements, the copy number of icest3 exhibited a sharp increase (9.6-fold) after mitomycin c exposure of its harboring strain cnrz385. this result was not observed when icest3 was introduced in a strain deriving icest1 host strain cnrz368, deleted for this element. this finding suggests an impact of the host cell on ice behavior. conclusions: all together, these results suggest a novel mechanism of regulation shared by icest1, icest3 and closely related ices, which we identified by analysis of recently sequenced genomes of firmicutes. this is the first report of a partial shutdown of the activity of an ice executed by a strain belonging to its primary host species. the sharp increase of icest3 copy number suggests an induction of replication; such conditional intracellular replication may be common among ices.

TI  == the fast milk acidifying phenotype of streptococcus thermophilus can be acquired  by natural transformation of the genomic island encoding the cell-envelope proteinase prts.
AB  == background: in industrial fermentation processes, the rate of milk acidification  by streptococcus thermophilus is of major technological importance. the cell-envelope proteinase prts was previously shown to be a key determinant of the milk acidification activity in this species. the prts enzyme is tightly anchored  to the cell wall via a mechanism involving the typical sortase a (srta) and initiates the breakdown of milk casein into small oligopeptides. the presence or  absence of prts divides the s. thermophilus strains into two phenotypic groups i.e. the slow and the fast acidifying strains. the aim of this study was to improve the milk acidification rate of slow s. thermophilus strains, and hence optimise the fermentation process of dairy products. results: in the present work, we developed for the first time a strategy based on natural transformation  to confer the rapid acidification phenotype to slow acidifying starter strains of s. thermophilus. first, we established by gene disruption that (i) prts, encoding the cell-envelope proteinase, is a key factor responsible for rapid milk acidification in fast acidifying strains, and that (ii) srta, encoding sortase a, is not absolutely required to express the prts activity. second, a 15-kb pcr product encompassing the prts genomic island was transferred by natural transformation using the competence-inducing peptide in three distinct prts-defective genetic backgrounds having or not a truncated sortase a gene. we showed that in all cases the milk acidification rate of transformants was significantly increased, reaching a level similar to that of wild-type fast acidifying strains. furthermore, it appeared that the prts-encoded activity does  not depend on the prts copy number or on its chromosomal integration locus. conclusion: we have successfully used natural competence to transfer the prts locus encoding the cell-envelope proteinase in three slow acidifying strains of s. thermophilus, allowing their conversion into fast acidifying derivatives. the  efficient protocol developed in this article will provide the dairy industry with novel and optimised s. thermophilus starter strains.

TI  == specialized adaptation of a lactic acid bacterium to the milk environment: the comparative genomics of streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9.
AB  == background: streptococcus thermophilus represents the only species among the streptococci that has "generally regarded as safe" status and that plays an economically important role in the fermentation of yogurt and cheeses. we conducted comparative genome analysis of s. thermophilus lmd-9 to identify unique gene features as well as features that contribute to its adaptation to the dairy  environment. in addition, we investigated the transcriptome response of lmd-9 during growth in milk in the presence of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, a companion culture in yogurt fermentation, and during lytic bacteriophage infection. results: the s. thermophilus lmd-9 genome is comprised of a 1.8 mbp circular chromosome (39.1% gc; 1,834 predicted open reading frames)  and two small cryptic plasmids. genome comparison with the previously sequenced lmg 18311 and cnrz1066 strains revealed 114 kb of lmd-9 specific chromosomal region, including genes that encode for histidine biosynthetic pathway, a cell surface proteinase, various host defense mechanisms and a phage remnant. interestingly, also unique to lmd-9 are genes encoding for a putative mucus-binding protein, a peptide transporter, and exopolysaccharide biosynthetic  proteins that have close orthologs in human intestinal microorganisms. lmd-9 harbors a large number of pseudogenes (13% of orfeome), indicating that like lmg  18311 and cnrz1066, lmd-9 has also undergone major reductive evolution, with the  loss of carbohydrate metabolic genes and virulence genes found in their streptococcal counterparts. functional genome distribution analysis of orfeomes among streptococci showed that all three s. thermophilus strains formed a distinct functional cluster, further establishing their specialized adaptation to the nutrient-rich milk niche. an upregulation of crispr1 expression in lmd-9 during lytic bacteriophage dt1 infection suggests its protective role against phage invasion. when co-cultured with l. bulgaricus, lmd-9 overexpressed genes involved in amino acid transport and metabolism as well as dna replication. conclusions: the genome of s. thermophilus lmd-9 is shaped by its domestication in the dairy environment, with gene features that conferred rapid growth in milk, stress response mechanisms and host defense systems that are relevant to its industrial applications. the presence of a unique exopolysaccharide gene cluster  and cell surface protein orthologs commonly associated with probiotic functionality revealed potential probiotic applications of lmd-9.

TI  == transcriptome analysis of adaptive heat shock response of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus, a gram-positive facultative anaerobe, is one of the most important lactic acid bacteria widely used in the dairy fermentation industry. in this study, we have analyzed the global transcriptional profiling of s. thermophilus upon temperature change. during a temperature shift from 42 degrees c to 50 degrees c, it is found that 196 (10.4%) genes show differential expression with 102 up-regulated and 94 down-regulated at 50 degrees c. in particular, 1) heat shock genes, such as dnak, groesl and clpl, are identified to be elevated at 50 degrees c; 2) transcriptional regulators, such as hrca, ctsr, fur, marr and merr family, are differentially expressed, indicating the complex molecular mechanisms of s. thermophilus adapting to heat shock; 3) genes associated with signal transduction, cell wall genes, iron homeostasis, abc transporters and restriction-modification system were induced; 4) a large number  of the differentially expressed genes are hypothetical genes of unknown function, indicating that much remains to be investigated about the heat shock response of  s. thermophilus. experimental investigation of selected heat shock gene clpl shows that it plays an important role in the physiology of s. thermophilus at high temperature and meanwhile we confirmed clpl as a member of the ctsr regulon. overall, this study has contributed to the underlying adaptive molecular mechanisms of s. thermophilus upon temperature change and provides a basis for future in-depth functional studies.

AB  == for biological extraction of heavy metals from chromated copper arsenate (cca) treated wood, different bacteria were investigated. the extraction rates of heavy metals using lactobacillusbulgaricus and streptococcusthermophilus were highest.  the chemical extraction rates were depended on the amounts of pyruvic acid and lactic acid. especially, the extraction rates using mixed pyruvic acid and lactic acid were increased compared to those of sole one. they were also enhanced in the mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus. to improve the extraction of  cca, a two-step processing procedure with the mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and  s. thermophilus was conducted. a maximum of 93% of copper, 86.5% of chromium, and 97.8% of arsenic were extracted after 4 days. these results suggest that a two-step process with the mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus is most effective to extract heavy metals from cca treated wood.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == production of multiple bacteriocins from a single locus by gastrointestinal strains of lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius isolates derived from a gastrointestinal origin have previously demonstrated efficacy for in vivo protection against listeria monocytogenes infection. in this study, comparative genomic analysis was employed to investigate the intraspecies diversity of seven  l. salivarius isolates of human and porcine intestinal origin, based on the genome of the well-characterized bacteriocin-producing strain l. salivarius ucc118. this revealed a highly conserved megaplasmid-borne gene cluster in these  strains involved in the regulation and secretion of two-component class iib bacteriocins. however, considerable intraspecific variation was observed in the structural genes encoding the bacteriocin peptides. they ranged from close relatives of abp118, such as salivaricin p, which differs by 2 amino acids, to completely novel bacteriocins, such as salivaricin t, which is characterized in this study. salivaricin t inhibits closely related lactobacilli and bears little  homology to previously characterized salivaricins. interestingly, the two peptides responsible for salivaricin t activity, saltalpha and saltbeta, share considerable identity with the component peptides of thermophilin 13, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus thermophilus. furthermore, the salivaricin  locus of strain dpc6488 also encodes an additional novel one-component class iid  anti-listerial bacteriocin, salivaricin l. these findings suggest a high level of redundancy in the bacteriocins that can be produced by intestinal l. salivarius isolates using the same enzymatic production and export machinery. such diversity may contribute to their ability to dominate and compete within the complex microbiota of the mammalian gut.

AB  == the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus (s. thermophilus) is widely  used in the dairy industry. as a food bacterium, it has to cope with changing environments such as milk, yogurt, as well as the digestive tract, after the product has been ingested. in bacteria, two-component systems (tcs) are one of the most prevalent mechanisms to sense and respond appropriately to a wide range  of signals. they are typically composed of a sensor kinase (hk) that detects a stimulus and a response regulator (rr) which acts as a transcriptional regulator. our objective was to make an inventory of the tcs present in s. thermophilus lmd-9 and investigate the contribution of each tcs to lmd-9 growth in milk. for that purpose, we performed in silico, transcriptomic as well as functional analysis. the lmd-9 genome presented 6 complete tcs with both hk and rr (tcs 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9) and 2 orphan rrs (rr01 and 08) with truncated hk. our in silico analysis revealed that for 5 tcs out of the 8, orthologs with known functions were found in other bacterial species whereas for tcs02, 4 and 6 the function of the orthologs are unidentified. transcriptomic studies (using quantitative pcr) revealed that all s. thermophilus lmd-9 response regulator genes were expressed in milk; they were expressed at different levels and with different profiles during growth. in mixed culture with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus), the s. thermophilus partner in yogurt, the expression of four s. thermophilus lmd-9 response regulator increased; two of them, rr02 and rr09, increased by a factor of 6. these results indicate that the  presence of l. bulgaricus induces regulatory changes in s. thermophilus. we also  demonstrated that a response regulator (rr02) can exert its regulatory function on its target genes even when expressed at very low levels. we showed that rr05-an ortholog of bacillus subtilis yycf or staphylococcus aureus walr-was essential for the growth of s. thermophilus. for the 7 other rrs, the absence of  a single response regulator gene was insufficient to notably impact the growth of lmd-9 in milk, with or without supplementation with purines, formate, or stress agents (lactate, h(2)o(2)). we demonstrated here that the 8 response regulators of lmd-9 are expressed--and thus potentially active--during growth in milk and suggested that the response regulators have possibly overlapping regulons and/or  functions not essential under the conditions tested.

TI  == microchip electrophoresis of bacteria using lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles.
AB  == the aggregation and adhesion of bacterial cells is a serious disadvantage for electrophoretic separations of bacteria. in this study, lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles were used as a pseudostationary phase to minimise the bacterial aggregation and adsorption to the inner walls of microchannels. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus rhamnosus were selected as analytes and were separated by microchip electrophoresis (mce) with laser-induced fluorescence (lif) detection using 4.5 mm tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (tris)-4.5 mm boric acid-0.1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate (edta) (tbe) containing poly(ethylene oxide) (peo) and lipid-based nanoparticles as the running buffer. the mechanism of lipid-based nanoparticles affecting bacterial adhesion and aggregation was discussed and supported by zeta potential experiments. under the optimal conditions, the three  species of bacteria were identified with patterned peaks. this proposed mce method using lipid-based nanoparticles as running buffer additives was also used  to analyse a real yogurt sample, and valuable bacterial information was obtained  by the electropherograms.

TI  == a novel biosensor based on lactobacillus acidophilus for determination of phenolic compounds in milk products and wastewater.
AB  == different branches of industry need to use phenolic compounds (pcs) in their production, so determination of pcs sensitively, accurately, rapidly, and economically is very important. for the sensitive determination of pcs, some biosensors based on pure polyphenol oxidase, plant tissue and microorganisms were developed before. but there has been no study to develop a microbial phenolic compounds biosensor based on lactobacillus species, which contain polyphenol oxidase enzyme. in this study, we used different forms of lactobacillus species as enzyme sources of biosensor and compared biosensor performances of these forms for determination of pcs. for this purpose, we used lyophilized lactobacillus cells (containing l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus), pure l. acidophilus, pure l. bulgaricus, and l. acidophilus- and l. bulgaricus adapted to catechol in lactobacilli mrs broth. the most suitable form was determined and optimization studies of the biosensor were carried out by using this form. for preparing the bioactive layer of the biosensor, the lactobacillus  cells were immobilized in gelatin by using glutaraldehyde. in the study, we used  catechol as a substrate. phenolic compound determination is based on the assay of the differences on the respiration activity of the cells on the oxygen meter in the absence and the presence of catechol. the microbial biosensor response depends directly on catechol concentration between 0.5 and 5.0 mm with 18 min response time. in the optimization studies of the microbial biosensor the most suitable microorganism amount was found to be 10 mg, and also phosphate buffer (ph 8.0; 50 mm) and 37.5 degrees c were obtained as the optimum working conditions. in the characterization studies of the microbial biosensor some parameters such as substrate specificity on the biosensor response and operational and storage stability were examine. furthermore, the determination of pc levels in synthetic wastewater, industrial wastewater, and milk products was investigated by using the developed biosensor under optimum conditions.

TI  == growth and exopolysaccharide production by streptococcus thermophilus st1 in skim milk.
AB  == to analyze the exopolysaccharide (eps) production by streptococcus thermophilus st1, cultures were cultivated in 10% (w/v) reconstituted skim milk under different growth conditions including various temperatures and phs of growth medium, supplementation of the medium with various carbon sources (glucose, lactose, sucrose, galactose and fructose) and nitrogen source (whey protein concentrate, or wpc). the results showed that most eps production by strain st1 was obtained at a temperature (42 degrees c) and ph (6.5) optimal for its growth. supplementation of the skim milk medium with either carbohydrates or wpc increased both growth and polymer formation by different extents, with sucrose being most effective among the carbon sources tested. under the optimal cultural  conditions, i.e. ph 6.5, 42 degrees c with 2% (w/v) sucrose and 0.5% (w/v) wpc, 135.80 mg l(-1) of eps was produced by strain st1. the monosaccharide composition of the eps was determined to be glucose and galactose (2:1), and the molecular mass of the eps was 3.97 x 10(6) da. the aqueous solution of the eps at 1% (w/v)  showed relatively high viscosity, indicating the potential of this eps-producing  s. thermophilus strain for applications in the improvement of physical properties of fermented milk products.

AB  == bifidobacteria are probiotic microorganisms that are widely used in the food industry. with the aim of using of petrifilm aerobic count (ac) plates associated with selective culture media, aliquots of sterile skim milk were inoculated separately with four commercial cultures of bifidobacteria. these cultures were plated by both the conventional method and petrifilmac, using the culture media nnlp and abc. the cultures were incubated under anaerobiosis at 37 degrees c for  24, 48 and 72 h. no significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed between the  obtained counts at 48 and 72 h. bifidobacteria counts in abc were usually higher  than in nnlp, independent of the plating method. subsequently, fermented milk was prepared with a streptococcus thermophilus strain, and aliquots were inoculated with the same bifidobacteria. then, the fermented milks were submitted to microbiological analysis for bifidobacteria enumeration using the same culture media and methodologies previously described, incubated under anaerobiosis at 37  degrees c for 48 h. again, bifidobacteria counts in abc were higher than in nnlp, with significant differences for some cultures (p < 0.05). the counts obtained by both methodologies presented significant correlations (p < 0.05). the results indicate the viability of petrifilmac as an alternative method for bifidobacteria enumeration when associated to specific culture media, specially the abc.

TI  == suppression of th17 response by streptococcus thermophilus st28 through induction of ifn-gamma.
AB  == the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (il)-17 plays important roles in various inflammatory diseases, and il-17-producing t helper 17 cells (th17) have received much attention. for therapy of th17-mediated diseases, some reports have indicated the clinical efficacy of lactic acid bacteria, including streptococcus  thermophilus. in this study, we examined the mechanism for the suppressive effects of s. thermophilus st28 on the th17 response in murine splenocytes stimulated with transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta plus il-6. stimulation with tgf-beta plus il-6 increased mrna expression of il-17 and its production in the splenocytes, but st28 markedly suppressed both. meanwhile, st28 increased the mrna expression of interferon (ifn)-gamma as well as its production. anti-ifn-gamma completely cancelled the suppressive effect of st28 on il-17 production. from these data, it was concluded that ifn-gamma induced by st28 had  an important role on the effect. a genomic dna (10 microg/ml) from st28 effectively suppressed il-17 production, probably via the toll-like receptor 9. therefore, modulation of th1/th17 balance would be one of the mechanisms under which s. thermophilus st28 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect.

TI  == the initiation of gtp hydrolysis by the g-domain of feob: insights from a transition-state complex structure.
AB  == the polytopic membrane protein feob is a ferrous iron transporter in prokaryotes. the protein contains a potassium-activated gtpase domain that is essential in regulating the import of iron and conferring virulence to many disease-causing bacteria. however, the mechanism by which the g-domain of feob hydrolyzes gtp is  not well understood. in particular, it is not yet known how the pivotal step in gtp hydrolysis is achieved: alignment of a catalytic water molecule. in the current study, the crystal structure of the soluble domains from streptococcus thermophilus feob (nfeob(st)) in complex with the activating potassium ion and a  transition-state analogue, gdpalf(4) (-), reveals a novel mode of water alignment involving contacts with the protein backbone only. in parallel to the structural  studies, a series of seven mutant proteins were constructed that targeted conserved residues at the active site of nfeob(st), and the nucleotide binding and hydrolysis properties of these were measured and compared to the wild-type protein. the results show that mutations in thr35 abolish gtpase activity of the  protein, while other conserved residues (tyr58, ser64, glu66 and glu67) are not required for water alignment by nfeob(st). together with the crystal structure, the findings suggest a new mechanism for hydrolysis initiation in small g-proteins, in which the attacking water molecule is aligned by contacts with the protein backbone only.

TI  == classification of swiss cheese starter and adjunct cultures using fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy.
AB  == the acceptability of swiss cheese largely depends on the flavor profile, and strain variations of cheese cultures will affect the final quality. conventional  biochemical methods to identify the cultures at the strain level are time-consuming and expensive, and require skilled labor. our objective was to develop rapid classification methods of starter cultures at the strain level by using a combination of hydrophobic grid membrane filters and fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy. forty-four pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-verified strains of starter and nonstarter cultures including streptococcus thermophilus, propionibacterium freudenreichii, and lactobacillus spp. were analyzed. the strains were grown on their respective agar media, transferred to broth media, and incubated. then, cultures were centrifuged and the pellets were resuspended in saline solution (10 mul). aliquots (2 mul) of the suspended bacterial solution were placed onto a grid of the hydrophobic grid membrane filters, having 6 grids per each strain analyzed. the dried filters were read by ftir microspectroscopy fitted with an attenuated total reflectance probe. collected spectra were statistically analyzed by a soft independent modeling of class analogy (simca) for pattern recognition. classification models were developed for streptococcus thermophilus, propionibacterium freudenreichii, and lactobacillus spp. strains. the models showed major discrimination in the spectral region from 1,200 to 900 cm(-1) associated with signals from phosphate-containing compounds and various polysaccharides in the cell wall. the  developed method allowed for rapid classification of several swiss cheese starter and nonstarter cultures at the strain level. this information provides a detailed overview of microbiological status, which would enable corrective measures to be  taken early in the cheese making process, limiting production of inferior quality cheese and minimizing defects. this method could be an effective tool to identify and monitor activity of cheese and other dairy starter cultures.

AB  == in order to investigate the microflora of slovakian bryndza cheese (a cheese containing unpasteurized or pasteurized ewes' milk component) by a culture-independent method, dna was extracted directly from 7 bryndza samples and analysed by an innovative method. using the universal prokaryotic and fungal primers, ribosomal dna internal transcribed spacer (its) regions with variable length were amplified. the standard universal reverse primer l1 aligning to bacterial 23s rdna was found unsuitable for some lactic acid bacteria and other species based on in silico analysis. therefore, l1 primer was replaced by a combination of novel primers gplusr and gminusr aligning to the adjacent, more conserved dna region. the amplification profiles were visualised by both standard electrophoresis and by fluorescent capillary gel electrophoresis. from representative samples, major amplicons were excised from the gel, cloned and sequenced. sequencing revealed that the samples contained lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, streptococcus macedonicus, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, debaromyces hansenii, mucor fragilis, yarrowia lipolytica and galactomyces geotrichum. these results represent an extension of the knowledge on the microflora of slovakian bryndza cheese. the introduced automated ribosomal dna intergenic spacer analysis of the bacterial and fungal genomes proved to be very effective in the application of studying microflora of cheese.

TI  == the proprems trial: investigating the effects of probiotics on late onset sepsis  in very preterm infants.
AB  == background: late onset sepsis is a frequent complication of prematurity associated with increased mortality and morbidity. the commensal bacteria of the  gastrointestinal tract play a key role in the development of healthy immune responses. healthy term infants acquire these commensal organisms rapidly after birth. however, colonisation in preterm infants is adversely affected by delivery mode, antibiotic treatment and the intensive care environment. altered microbiota composition may lead to increased colonisation with pathogenic bacteria, poor immune development and susceptibility to sepsis in the preterm infant.probiotics  are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts confer health benefits on the host. amongst numerous bacteriocidal and nutritional roles, they may also favourably modulate host immune responses in local and remote tissues. meta-analyses of probiotic supplementation in preterm infants report a reduction in mortality and necrotising enterocolitis. studies with sepsis as an outcome have reported mixed results to date.allergic diseases are increasing in incidence in "westernised" countries. there is evidence that probiotics may reduce the incidence of these diseases by altering the intestinal  microbiota to influence immune function. methods/design: this is a multi-centre,  randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled trial investigating supplementing  preterm infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation weighing < 1500 g, with a probiotic combination (bifidobacterium infantis, streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium lactis). a total of 1,100 subjects are being recruited in australia and new zealand. infants commence the allocated intervention from soon  after the start of feeds until discharge home or term corrected age. the primary  outcome is the incidence of at least one episode of definite (blood culture positive) late onset sepsis before 40 weeks corrected age or discharge home. secondary outcomes include: necrotising enterocolitis, mortality, antibiotic usage, time to establish full enteral feeds, duration of hospital stay, growth measurements at 6 and 12 months' corrected age and evidence of atopic conditions  at 12 months' corrected age. discussion: results from previous studies on the use of probiotics to prevent diseases in preterm infants are promising. however, a large clinical trial is required to address outstanding issues regarding safety and efficacy in this vulnerable population. this study will address these important issues. trial registration: australia and new zealand clinical trials register (anzctr): actrn012607000144415the product "abc dophilus probiotic powder for infants(r)", solgar, usa has its 3 probiotics strains registered with the deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen (dsmz--german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures) as bb-12 15954, b-02 96579, th-4 15957.

TI  == the streptococcus thermophilus crispr/cas system provides immunity in escherichia coli.
AB  == the crispr/cas adaptive immune system provides resistance against phages and plasmids in archaea and bacteria. crispr loci integrate short dna sequences from  invading genetic elements that provide small rna-mediated interference in subsequent exposure to matching nucleic acids. in streptococcus thermophilus, it  was previously shown that the crispr1/cas system can provide adaptive immunity against phages and plasmids by integrating novel spacers following exposure to these foreign genetic elements that subsequently direct the specific cleavage of  invasive homologous dna sequences. here, we show that the s. thermophilus crispr3/cas system can be transferred into escherichia coli and provide heterologous protection against plasmid transformation and phage infection. we show that interference is sequence-specific, and that mutations in the vicinity or within the proto-spacer adjacent motif (pam) allow plasmids to escape crispr-encoded immunity. we also establish that cas9 is the sole cas gene necessary for crispr-encoded interference. furthermore, mutation analysis revealed that interference relies on the cas9 mcra/hnh- and ruvc/rnaseh-motifs. altogether, our results show that active crispr/cas systems can be transferred across distant genera and provide heterologous interference against invasive nucleic acids. this can be leveraged to develop strains more robust against phage attack, and safer organisms less likely to uptake and disseminate plasmid-encoded undesirable genetic elements.

AB  == yoghurt is increasingly being used as a carrier of probiotic bacteria for their potential health benefits. to meet with a recommended level of >/=10(6) viable cells/g of a product, assessment of viability of probiotic bacteria in market preparations is crucial. this requires a working method for selective enumeration of these probiotic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria in yoghurt such as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. acidophilus, lb. casei and bifidobacterium. this chapter presents an overview of  media that could be used for differential and selective enumerations of yoghurt bacteria. de man rogosa sharpe agar containing fructose (mrsf), mrs agar ph 5.2 (mrs 5.2), reinforced clostridial prussian blue agar at ph 5.0 (rcpb 5.0) or reinforced clostridial agar at ph 5.3 (rca 5.3) are suitable for enumeration of lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus when the incubation is carried out at 45 degrees c for 72h. s. thermophilus (st) agar and m17 are recommended for selective enumeration of s. thermophilus. selective enumeration of lb. acidophilus in mixed culture could be made in rogosa agar added with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (x-glu) or mrs containing maltose (mrsm) and incubation in a 20% co2 atmosphere. lb. casei could be selectively enumerated on specially formulated lb. casei (lc) agar from products  containing yoghurt starter bacteria (s. thermophilus and lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), lb. acidophilus, bifidobacterium spp. and lb. casei. bifidobacterium could be enumerated on mrs agar supplemented with nalidixic acid, paromomycin, neomycin sulphate and lithium chloride (mrs-npnl) under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 72h.

TI  == peptide-regulated gene depletion system developed for use in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == to facilitate the study of pneumococcal genes that are essential for viability or normal cell growth, we sought to develop a tightly regulated, titratable gene depletion system that interferes minimally with normal cellular functions. a possible candidate for such a system is the recently discovered signal transduction pathway regulating competence for natural transformation in streptococcus thermophilus. this pathway, which is unrelated to the comcde pathway used for competence regulation in streptococcus pneumoniae, has not been  fully elucidated, but it is known to include a short unmodified signaling peptide, coms*, an oligopeptide transport system, ami, and a transcriptional activator, comr. the transcriptional activator is thought to bind to an inverted  repeat sequence termed the ecom box. we introduced the comr protein and the ecom  box into the genome of s. pneumoniae r6 and demonstrated that addition of synthetic coms* peptide induced the transcription of a luciferase gene inserted downstream of the ecom box. to determine whether the comrs system could be used for gene depletion studies, the licd1 gene was inserted behind the chromosomally  located ecom box promoter by using the janus cassette. then, the native versions  of licd1 and licd2 were deleted, and the resulting mutant was recovered in the presence of coms*. cultivation of the licd1 licd2 double mutant in the absence of coms* gradually affected its ability to grow and propagate, demonstrating that the comrs system functions as intended. in the present study, the comrs system was developed for use in s. pneumoniae. in principle, however, it should work equally well in many other gram-positive species.

AB  == the up- and downstream regions of ctl1 and ctl2 that encode a cystathionine lyase were analyzed in various lactobacillus casei strains. ctl1 and ctl2 were found to be part of a gene cluster encoding two other open reading frames. one of the two  open reading frames precedes ctl1 and encodes a putative cysteine synthase. the other open reading frame lies downstream of ctl1 and encodes a putative serine acetyltransferase. the gene cluster is not present in the publicly available genome sequences of l. casei atcc 334, bl23 and zhang. apparently, the gene cluster was acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event and can also be found in other lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. rt-pcr was used to  analyze the expression of the gene cluster. additionally, an mass spectrometry-based selected reaction monitoring method was developed for quantifying ctl1 in a cell-free extract of lactic acid bacteria. the gene cluster cysk2-ctl1-cyse2 was expressed as single transcript, and expression was down-regulated by cysteine. in addition, cystathionine lyase activity present in  cell-free extracts disappeared when l. casei was grown in the presence of cysteine. whereas the transcript and the gene product of ctl1 protein were found  in all studied ctl1(+)l. casei strains, only the transcript but not the protein or cystathionine lyase activity was detected in l. helveticus fam2888, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 and s. thermophilus fam17014, which actually possess a homolog of the cysk2-ctl1-cyse2 gene cluster.

AB  == scotta is the main by-product in the making of ricotta cheese. it is widely produced in southern europe and particularly in italy where it represents a serious environmental pollutant due to its high lactose content. with the aim of  evaluating whether scotta bioconversion into lactic acid can be considered as an  alternative to its disposal, besides providing it with an added value, here the growth, fermentative performances, and lactic acid productions of pure and mixed  cultures of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated on ovine scotta-based media, without and with the addition of nutritional supplements. the outcomes indicate that ovine scotta can  be utilized for the biotechnological production of lactic acid with yields up to  92%, comparable to those obtained on cheese-whey. indeed, the addition of nutritional supplements generally improves the fermentative performances of lactic acid bacteria leading to about 2 g l(-1) h(-1) of lactic acid. moreover, the use of mixed cultures for scotta bioconversion reduces the need for nutritional supplements, with no detrimental effects on the productive parameters compared to pure cultures. finally, by using l. casei and s. thermophilus in pure and mixed cultures, up to 99% optically pure l: -lactic acid can be obtained.

TI  == site-specific accretion of an integrative conjugative element together with a related genomic island leads to cis mobilization and gene capture.
AB  == genomic islands, flanked by attachment sites, devoid of conjugation and recombination modules and related to the integrative and conjugative element (ice) icest3, were previously found in streptococcus thermophilus. here, we show  that icest3 transfers to a recipient harbouring a similar engineered genomic island, cimel(3)catr(3), and integrates by site-specific recombination into its attachment sites, leading to their accretion. the resulting composite island can  excise, showing that icest3 mobilizes cimel(3)catr(3), in cis. icest3, cimel(3)catr(3), and the whole composite element can transfer from the strain harbouring the composite structure. the icest3 transfer to a recipient bearing cimel(3)catr(3), can also lead to retromobilization, i.e. its capture by the donor. this is the first demonstration of specific conjugative mobilization of a  genomic island in cis and the first report of ice-mediated retromobilization. cimel(3)catr(3), would be the prototype of a novel class of non-autonomous mobile elements (cimes: cis mobilizable elements), which hijack the recombination and conjugation machinery of related ices to excise, transfer and integrate. few genome analyses have shown that cimes could be widespread and have revealed internal repeats that could result from accretions in numerous genomic islands, suggesting that accretion and cis mobilization have a key role in evolution of genomic islands.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == short communication: characterization of microflora in mexican chihuahua cheese.
AB  == this work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in mexico using 16s rrna gene analysis. as expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including escherichia coli and  staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in  9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent  being lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. leuconostoc mesenteroides and streptococcus macedonicus were identified  in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional chihuahua  cheese attributes.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == effect of functional yogurt ny-yp901 in improving the trait of metabolic syndrome.
AB  == background/objectives: this study was aimed to assess the beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome of functional yogurt ny-yp901 (namyang dairy product co. ltd and nutra r&bt inc., seoul, korea) supplemented with mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium infantis and extra-ingredients containing bifidobacterium breve (cbg-c2), enterococcus faecalis fk-23, fibersol-2 and so on. subjects/methods: this study was designed as an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study. treatment and control groups consumed a functional yogurt ny-yp901 (150 ml) and a placebo yogurt twice a day, respectively, for 8 weeks. body weight and body mass  index (bmi), blood pressure, lipid profiles, fasting glucose with hba1c and waist circumference were measured before and after treatment. inclusion criteria were healthy individuals between the ages 20-65 years old who submitted an informed consent. results: during the period august 2009 to december 2009, 101 healthy participants (31 males and 70 females) finished the study. treatment group were 53 individuals, and the control group were 48 individuals. in the treatment group consuming ny-yp901, statistically significant beneficial changes were observed in body weight (treatment group vs control group=-0.24+/-1.50 vs +0.64+/-1.39 kg, p<0.05), bmi (-0.10+/-0.58 vs +0.24+/-0.50 kg/m(2), p<0.05 ) and low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-cholesterol (-7.71+/-14.14 vs -0.43+/-15.32 mg/dl, p<0.05) after 8 weeks. the change in other parameters was not different between the treatment and the control groups. conclusions: the functional yogurt ny-yp901 reduced ldl-cholesterol, body weight and bmi in the subjects at a 300-ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. from these findings, regular intake of functional  yogurt ny-yp901 may be consequently related to improve metabolic syndrome.

TI  == typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr to assess genetic diversity.
AB  == the recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. the current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified dna, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. we have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, streptococcus thermophilus, bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. initially, purified dna and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. the conditions that were found to be optimal 8 mum of 10-mer primers, 3 mum magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. the rapd genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) pfu ml(-1) were highly reproducible. clustering by the pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar dna restriction pattern were indistinguishable. the results support the use of rapd-pcr for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of  their genetic diversity bypassing tedious dna purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.

TI  == production of glutathione using a bifunctional enzyme encoded by gshf from streptococcus thermophilus expressed in escherichia coli.
AB  == glutathione (gsh) is one of the most ubiquitous non-protein thiols that is involved in numerous cellular activities. the gene coding for a novel bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the reaction for glutathione synthesis, gshf, was  cloned from streptococcus thermophilus siim b218 and expressed in escherichia coli jm109. in the presence of the precursor amino acids and atp, the induced cells of e. coli jm109 (ptrc99a-gshf) could accumulate 10.3 mm gsh in 5 h. the s. thermophilus gshf was insensitive to feedback inhibition caused by gsh even at 20 mm. at elevated concentrations of the precursor amino acids and atp, e. coli jm109 (ptrc99a-gshf) produced 36 mm gsh with a molar yield of 0.9 mol/mol based on added cysteine and of 0.45 mol/mol based on added atp. when atp was replaced with glucose, e. coli jm109 (ptrc99a-gshf) produced 7 mm in 3h. saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to generate atp for gsh production. in the presence of glucose and the pmr1 mutant of s. cerevisiae by4742, jm109 (ptrc99a-gshf) produced 33.9 mm gsh in 12h with a yield of 0.85 mol/mol based on added l-cysteine. it is shown that the s. thermophilus gshf can be successfully used for gsh production.

TI  == poly(dimethyl siloxane) surface modification with biosurfactants isolated from probiotic strains.
AB  == depending on the final application envisaged for a given biomaterial, many surfaces must be modified before use. the material performance in a biological environment is mainly mediated by its surface properties that can be improved using suitable modification methods. the aim of this work was to coat poly(dimethyl siloxane) (pdms) surfaces with biosurfactants (bss) and to evaluate how these compounds affect the pdms surface properties. bss isolated from four probiotic strains (lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus a, and streptococcus thermophilus b) were used. bare pdms and pdms coated with bss were characterized by contact angle measurements, infrared spectroscopy (atr-ftir), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps), and atomic force microscopy (afm). the influence of the surface modifications on the materials blood compatibility was studied through thrombosis and hemolysis assays. the cytotoxicity of these materials was tested against rat peritoneal macrophages. afm results demonstrated the successful coating of the surfaces. also, by contact angle measurements, an increase of the coated surfaces hydrophilicity was seen. furthermore, xps analysis indicated a decrease of the silicon content at the surface, and atr-ftir results showed the presence of bs characteristic groups as  a consequence of the modification. all the studied materials revealed no toxicity and were found to be nonhemolytic. the proposed approach for the modification of  pdms surfaces was found to be effective and opens new possibilities for the application of these surfaces in the biomedical field.

TI  == dietary effect of folate-rich fermented milk produced by streptococcus thermophilus strains on hemoglobin level.
AB  == objective: folate, a water-soluble vitamin, functions as a carbon carrier in the  formation of heme, the iron-containing non-protein portion of hemoglobin. therefore, its deficiency leads to anemia. the objective of this study was to determine the dietary effects of folate-rich fermented milk produced by high-folate-producing streptococcus thermophilus strains (rd 102 and rd 104) on hemoglobin level using a murine model. methods: thirty-two albino mice 30 +/- 10  d old were assigned to ingest a basal diet (i.e., a synthetic anemic diet, n = 8, group i, control 1), a basal diet with skim milk (n = 8, group ii, control 2), a  basal diet with fermented skim milk produced by folate plus rd 102 (n = 8, group  iii, test 1), and a basal diet with fermented skim milk produced by folate plus rd 104 (n = 8, group iv, test 2) in a 6-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. hemoglobin concentrations were estimated by the drabkin-austin cyanmethemoglobin method during the prefeeding (10 d), feeding (20 d), and postfeeding (10 d) trials, respectively. results: the results showed that the test groups (iii and iv) receiving folate-rich fermented milks prepared using high-folate producing s. thermophilus strains showed a significant increase in hemoglobin level compared with the control groups (i and ii). conclusion: folate-rich fermented milks have the potential to significantly increase the hemoglobin level of blood. hence, high-folate-producing s. thermophilus strains offer a novel natural approach to fortify dairy products with folate.

TI  == volatile sulphur compounds-forming abilities of lactic acid bacteria: c-s lyase activities.
AB  == volatile sulphur compounds (vscs) are of prime importance in the overall aroma of cheese and make a significant contribution to their typical flavours. thus, the control of vscs formation offers considerable potential for industrial applications. here, lactic acid bacteria (lab) from different ecological origins  were screened for their abilities to produce vscs from l-methionine. from the data presented, vsc-forming abilities were shown to be strain-specific and were correlated with the c-s lyase enzymatic activities determined using different approaches. high vscs formation were detected for those strains that were also shown to possess high thiol-producing abilities (determined either by agar plate  or spectrophotometry assays). moreover, differences in c-s lyase activities were  shown to correspond with the enzymatic potential of the strains as determined by  in situ gel visualization. therefore, the assessment of the c-s lyase enzymatic potential, by means of either of these techniques, could be used as a valuable approach for the selection of lab strains with high vsc-producing abilities thus, representing an effective way to enhance cheese sulphur aroma compounds synthesis. in this regard, this study highlights the flavour forming potential of the streptococcus thermophilus sty-31, that therefore could be used as a starter  culture in cheese manufacture. furthermore, although c-s lyases are involved in both biosynthetic and catabolic pathways, an association between methionine and cysteine auxotrophy of the selected strains and their vscs-producing abilities could not be found.

TI  == isolation and characterization of three novel peptides from casein hydrolysates that stimulate the growth of mixed cultures of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  == in this study, sodium caseinate hydrolysates produced by papain with strong growth-stimulating activity for streptococcus thermophilus (st) and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (lb) were obtained. a series of separation methods  including ultrafiltration, macroporous adsorption resin chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc) were applied to isolate and purify the peptide(s), which were mainly responsible for the activity. finally, three novel growth-stimulating peptides, h-2-a, f2-c, and f2-b, corresponding to amino acid residues 29-35 and 103-108 of bovine alpha(s2)-casein and 181-186 of bovine alpha(s1)-casein, respectively, were obtained. with supplementation of h-2-a, f2-b, or f2-c at a protein concentration of 0.3%, the biomass yield of these two lactic acid bacteria (lab) was enhanced by 193.3, 166.7, or 151.7%, respectively. in addition, there were significant (p < 0.05) increases in viable counts of st and  lactic acid production of lab in the presence of the purified peptides.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and streptococcus thermophilus induce suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (socs3) gene expression directly and indirectly via interleukin-10 in human primary macrophages.
AB  == in the present study we have characterized t helper type 2 (th2) [interleukin (il)-10]/th1 (il-12) cytokine expression balance in human primary macrophages stimulated with multiple non-pathogenic gram-positive bacteria used in the food industry and as probiotic substances. bacteria representing lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, leuconostoc, propionibacterium and streptococcus species induced anti-inflammatory il-10 production, although quantitative differences between the bacteria were observed. s. thermophilus was able to induce il-12 production, while the production of il-12 induced by other bacteria  remained at a low level. the highest anti-inflammatory potential was seen with bifidobacteria, as evidenced by high il-10/il-12 induction ratios. all studied non-pathogenic bacteria were able to stimulate the expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling (socs) 3 that controls the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes. lactobacillus and streptococcus species induced socs3 mrna expression directly in the absence of protein synthesis and indirectly via bacteria-induced il-10 production, as demonstrated by experiments with cycloheximide (chx) and anti-il-10 antibodies, respectively. the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) p38 signalling pathway played a key role  in bacteria-induced socs3 gene expression. enhanced il-10 production and socs3 gene expression induced by live non-pathogenic lactobacillus and streptococcus is also likely to contribute to their immunoregulatory effects in vivo.

TI  == oral ingestion of streptococcus thermophilus does not affect mucositis severity or tumor progression in the tumor-bearing rat.
AB  == preventative or adjunctive agents for the amelioration of small intestinal chemotherapy-induced mucositis are not currently available for clinical use. we have previously demonstrated that oral ingestion of streptococcus thermophilus (th-4) partially attenuated chemotherapy-induced mucositis in the rat. here we assess the effects of th-4 on small intestinal damage and tumor progression in tumor-bearing rats with experimentally-induced mucositis. female dark agouti tumor-bearing (mammary adenocarcinoma) rats (n = 36; 139 +/- 1 g) had small intestinal damage induced via the administration of methotrexate (mtx). rats were administered mtx; (1.5 mg/kg intramuscular) or saline at 0 and 24 h; with daily gavage administration of th-4 (109 cfu/ml) or skim milk from -48 to +96 h post-mtx. rats were allocated to groups (n=9): saline control, th-4 control, mtx  control or th-4+mtx. the non-invasive ( 13) c-sucrose breath test (sbt) was conducted prior to tumor inoculation, pre-mtx (-24 h) and prior to sacrifice (96  h) to monitor gut function. at sacrifice small intestinal segments were excised and assessed for sucrase and myeloperoxidase activity as well as histological damage. irrespective of th-4 treatment, mtx-treated rats had a significant decrease in bodyweight, sbt levels, sucrase and myeloperoxidase activity, and histological damage score (p < 0.05) compared to saline and th-4 control rats. th-4 treatment did not result in tumor progression (p > 0.05) but failed to alleviate mucositis indices. although th-4, at a dose of 109 cfu/ml, yielded neither protection nor amelioration of chemotherapy-induced mucositis, progression of mammary adenocarcinoma was unaffected.

TI  == clpc acts as a negative regulator of competence in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the alternative sigma factor comx is a key regulator of natural transformation in members of the genus streptococcus. comx controls expression of the late competence genes, which are essential for dna binding, uptake and recombination.  in streptococcus pneumoniae, it has been demonstrated that comx is degraded by clpep at the end of the competence period. in the present study we show that a different clp protease complex, clpcp, contributes to comx degradation in streptococcus thermophilus. mutant strains lacking the clpc chaperone displayed significantly increased transformability compared with the wild-type strain under conditions where comx was expressed at relatively low levels. at higher expression levels, clpcp appears to become saturated and unable to prevent the accumulation of comx. together, our results suggest that the role of clpc is to mediate degradation of comx when the sigma factor is produced in low amounts, i.e. when the environmental stimulus promoting competence development is weak. this would prevent s. thermophilus from developing the competent state at an inappropriate time and/or place.

TI  == rgg proteins associated with internalized small hydrophobic peptides: a new quorum-sensing mechanism in streptococci.
AB  == we identified a genetic context encoding a transcriptional regulator of the rgg family and a small hydrophobic peptide (shp) in nearly all streptococci and suggested that it may be involved in a new quorum-sensing mechanism, with shp playing the role of a pheromone. here, we provide further support for this hypothesis by constructing a phylogenetic tree of the rgg and rgg-like proteins from gram-positive bacteria and by studying the shp/rgg1358 locus of streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9. we identified the shp1358 gene as a target of rgg1358, and used it to confirm the existence of the steps of a quorum-sensing mechanism including secretion, maturation and reimportation of the pheromone into the cell. we used surface plasmon resonance to demonstrate interaction between the pheromone and the regulatory protein and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays to assess binding of the transcriptional regulator to the promoter regions of its target genes. the active form of the pheromone was identified by mass spectrometry. our findings demonstrate that the shp/rgg1358 locus encodes two components of a novel quorum-sensing mechanism involving a transcriptional regulator of the rgg family and a shp pheromone that is detected and reimported into the cell by the ami oligopeptide transporter.

TI  == a fermented formula in pre-term infants: clinical tolerance, gut microbiota, down-regulation of faecal calprotectin and up-regulation of faecal secretory iga.
AB  == intestinal bacterial colonisation in pre-term infants is delayed compared with full-term infants, leading to an increased risk of gastrointestinal disease. modulation of colonisation through dietary supplementation with probiotics or prebiotics could decrease such a risk. the present study evaluated clinical tolerance, the effects on gut microbiota, and inflammatory and immunological mucosal responses to an infant formula adapted for pre-term infants that included in its manufacturing process a fermentation step with two probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve c50 and streptococcus thermophilus 065, inactivated by heat at the end of the process. a total of fifty-eight infants (gestational age: 30-35 weeks), fed either the fermented pre-term formula or a standard pre-term formula, were followed up during their hospital stay. clinical tolerance, faecal microbiota using a culture and a culture-independent method (temporal temperature gel electrophoresis), faecal calprotectin and secretory iga were analysed weekly. no difference was observed regarding anthropometric data and digestive tolerance, except for abdominal distension, the incidence of which was lower in infants fed  the fermented formula for 2 weeks. bacterial colonisation was not modified by the type of feeding, particularly for bifidobacteria. faecal calprotectin was significantly lower in infants fed the fermented formula for 2 weeks, and secretory iga increased with both mother's milk and the fermented formula. the fermented formula was well tolerated and did not significantly modulate the bacterial colonisation but had benefits on inflammatory and immune markers, which might be related to some features of gastrointestinal tolerance.

TI  == coexpression of the superoxide dismutase and the catalase provides remarkable oxidative stress resistance in lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally sensitive to oxidative stress caused by  reactive oxygen species (ros). antioxidant enzymes, especially superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase (cat), can protect against ros by eliminating superoxide and h(2)o(2), respectively. lactobacillus rhamnosus is a valuable probiotic starter culture but is deficient in both sod and cat, and is thus likely to suffer from oxidative stress in industrial fermentation. to confer high level of oxidative resistance on l. rhamnosus , the sod gene soda from streptococcus thermophilus and cat gene kata from l. sakei were coexpressed in l. rhamnosus as 1.2466. the enzyme activities of sod and cat were 147.80 +/- 1.08 u/mg protein and 2.53 mumol of h(2)o(2) /min/10(8) cfu, respectively, in the recombinant l. rhamnosus cs. after incubation with 10 mm h(2)o(2), the survival ratio of l. rhamnosus cs was 400-fold higher than that of l. rhamnosus cat. in long-term aerated conditions, viable cells of l. rhamnosus cs remained approximately 10(6) cfu/ml after incubation for 7 days, while no living cells of  the control were detected. these results showed that the cooperation between sod  and cat could significantly enhance oxidative resistance in l. rhamnosus . to our best knowledge, this is the first report of two synergistic antioxidant genes being coexpressed in the same lactobacilli.

AB  == a pentaplex pcr assay for the rapid, selective and simultaneous detection of lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. fermentum, was developed. the target sequences were a group of genes coding for beta-galactosidase production (s. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), for cell-enveloped associated proteinase synthesis (l. helveticus), for dipeptide transport system production (l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and for arginine-ornithine antiporter protein production (l. fermentum). the analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated with 5 reference strains and 140 lactic acid bacterial strains derived  from raw milk cheeses and belonging to the lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus and enterococcus genera. the identification limit for each target strain was 10(3)cfu/ml. this new molecular assay was used to investigate the lab  population by direct extraction of dna from the 12 whey cultures for grana padano. the pentaplex pcr assay revealed a good correspondence with microbiological analyses and allowed to identify even minor lab community members which, can be out-competed in vitro by numerically more abundant microbial species.

TI  == hyaluronic acid production by recombinant streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == generally recognized as safe, streptococcus thermophilus was transformed using a  plasmid expressing endogenous hyaluronic acid (ha) synthase genes. a single expression of hyaluronic acid synthase (hasa), uridine diphosphate-glucose dehydrogenase gene (hasb), or pyrophosphorylase gene (glmu) and double expression of hasa and hasb were attempted. a streptococcus-escherichia coli shuttle vector, pbe31, was successfully transfected in s. thermophilus. the single expression of  hasa or hasb allowed s. thermophilus to produce about 0.5-1.0 g/l ha. the strains coexpressing of hasa and hasb showed a markedly increased ha production (1.2g/l)  which was six-fold increase compared with the wild-type strain. the maximum cell  concentration and specific growth rate of each recombinant strain were lower than those of the wild-type strain; however, the specific production rate was more than 100-fold higher. galactose concentration decreased in the coexpressing strain after depletion of lactose. the bacterial metabolism would be altered in order to achieve a higher production by changing the intracellular metabolism. the average molecular weight of ha (1.0 x 10(6) da) was not affected by the expression of hasa and hasb. ha produced from recombinant strain could be an alternative material for medical, cosmetic and food utilization instead of ha from conventional pathogenic streptococci.

TI  == cas3 is a single-stranded dna nuclease and atp-dependent helicase in the crispr/cas immune system.
AB  == clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (crispr) is a recently discovered adaptive prokaryotic immune system that provides acquired immunity against foreign nucleic acids by utilizing small guide crrnas (crispr rnas) to interfere with invading viruses and plasmids. in escherichia coli, cas3 is essential for crrna-guided interference with virus proliferation. cas3 contains n-terminal hd phosphohydrolase and c-terminal superfamily 2 (sf2) helicase domains. here, we provide the first report of the cloning, expression, purification and in vitro functional analysis of the cas3 protein of the streptococcus thermophilus crispr4 (ecoli subtype) system. cas3 possesses a single-stranded dna (ssdna)-stimulated atpase activity, which is coupled to unwinding of dna/dna and rna/dna duplexes. cas3 also shows atp-independent nuclease activity located in the hd domain with a preference for ssdna substrates. to dissect the contribution of individual domains, cas3 separation-of-function mutants (atpase(+)/nuclease(-) and atpase(-)/nuclease(+))  were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. we propose that the cas3 atpase/helicase domain acts as a motor protein, which assists delivery of the nuclease activity to cascade-crrna complex targeting foreign dna.

TI  == impact of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5-containing yoghurt, on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults.
AB  == this randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel dose-response study investigated the impact of 4-week commercial yoghurt consumption supplemented with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb-12) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5) on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults. fifty-eight volunteers were randomly assigned to three different groups: 1. placebo (no probiotic, no starter and no green tea extract); 2. yoptimal (10(9)cfu/100g of bb-12 and la-5 and 40mg  of green tea extract) and 3. yoptimal-10 (10(10)cfu/100g of bb-12, 10(9)cfu/100g  of la-5 and 40mg of green tea extract). these yoghurt products also contained lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (10(7)cfu/100g) and streptococcus thermophilus (10(10)cfu/100g). the quantitative pcr (qpcr) results showed that there were significant increases (p=0.02) in bifidobacteria counts with the yoptimal treatment as compared to baseline. the fecal numbers of b. animalis subsp. lactis and la-5 significantly increased in the two probiotic treatments compared to the placebo treatment. viable counts of fecal lactobacilli were significantly higher (p=0.05) and those of enterococci were significantly lower (p=0.04) after the intervention when compared to placebo. no significant difference was observed between treatments in volunteers' weight, waist girth, blood pressure, fasting plasma triglyceride and hdl-c concentrations, as well as  cholesterol/hdl-cholesterol ratio. however, a significant increase in plasma cholesterol levels was observed in the placebo group (p=0.0018) but the levels remained stable in the two probiotic yoghurt groups. these results show that probiotic strains supplemented in the form of yoghurt remain active during gut transit and are associated with an increase in beneficial bacteria and a reduction in potentially pathogenic bacteria. this trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct00730626.

TI  == the first c-glycosidic analogue of a novel galactosyltransferase inhibitor.
AB  == structural analogues and mimics of the natural sugar-nucleotide udp-galactose (udp-gal) are sought after as chemical tools for glycobiology and drug discovery. we have recently developed a novel class of galactosyltransferase (galt) inhibitors derived from udp-gal, bearing an additional substituent at the 5-position of the uracil base. herein we report the first c-glycosidic derivative of this new class of galt inhibitors. we describe a practical convergent synthesis of the new udp-c-gal derivative, including a systematic study into the  use of radical chemistry for the preparation of galactosyl ethylphosphonate, a key synthetic intermediate. the new inhibitor showed activity against a bacterial udp-gal 4'-epimerase at micromolar concentrations. this is the first example of a base-modified udp-sugar as an inhibitor of a udp-sugar-dependent enzyme which is  not a glycosyltransferase, and these results may therefore have implications for  the design of inhibitors of these enzymes in the future.

TI  == complete sequencing and pan-genomic analysis of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus reveal its genetic basis for industrial yogurt production.
AB  == lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (lb. bulgaricus) is an important species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) used for cheese and yogurt fermentation. the genome of lb. bulgaricus 2038, an industrial strain mainly used for yogurt production, was completely sequenced and compared against the other two atcc collection strains of the same subspecies. specific physiological properties of strain 2038, such as lysine biosynthesis, formate production, aspartate-related carbon-skeleton intermediate metabolism, unique eps synthesis and efficient dna restriction/modification systems, are all different from those of the collection  strains that might benefit the industrial production of yogurt. other common features shared by lb. bulgaricus strains, such as efficient protocooperation with streptococcus thermophilus and lactate production as well as well-equipped stress tolerance mechanisms may account for it being selected originally for yogurt fermentation industry. multiple lines of evidence suggested that lb. bulgaricus 2038 was genetically closer to the common ancestor of the subspecies than the other two sequenced collection strains, probably due to a strict industrial maintenance process for strain 2038 that might have halted its genome  decay and sustained a gene network suitable for large scale yogurt production.

TI  == comparison of culture-dependent and -independent methods for bacterial community  monitoring during montasio cheese manufacturing.
AB  == the microbial community in milk is of great importance in the manufacture of traditional cheeses produced using raw milk and natural cultures. during milk curdling and cheese ripening, complex interactions occur in the microbial community, and accurate identification of the microorganisms involved provides essential information for understanding their role in these processes and in flavor production. recent improvements in molecular biological methods have led to their application to food matrices, and thereby opened new perspectives for the study of microbial communities in fermented foods. in this study, a description of microbial community composition during the manufacture and ripening of montasio cheese was provided. a combined approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods was applied. culture-dependent identification was compared with 16s clone libraries sequencing data obtained from both dna and reverse-transcribed rna (cdna) amplification and real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) assays developed to detect and quantify specific bacterial species/genera (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas spp.). s. thermophilus was the predominant lab species throughout the entire ripening period of montasio cheese. the culture-independent method demonstrates the relevant presence of pseudomonas spp. and lactococcus piscium at the beginning of ripening. the culture-dependent approach and the two culture-independent approaches produced complementary information, together generating a general view of cheese microbial ecology.

TI  == effect of oxidoreduction potential on aroma biosynthesis by lactic acid bacteria  in nonfat yogurt.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oxidoreduction potential (eh) on the biosynthesis of aroma compounds by lactic acid bacteria in non-fat yogurt. the study was done with yogurts fermented by lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. the eh was modified by the application of different gaseous conditions (air, nitrogen, and nitrogen/hydrogen). acetaldehyde, dimethyl sulfide, diacetyl, and pentane-2,3-dione, as the major endogenous odorant compounds of yogurt, were chosen as tracers for the biosynthesis of aroma compounds by lactic acid bacteria. oxidative conditions favored the production of acetaldehyde, dimethyl sulfide, and diketones (diacetyl and pentane-2,3-dione). the eh of the medium influences aroma production in yogurt by modifying the metabolic pathways of lb. bulgaricus and strep. thermophilus. the use of eh as a  control parameter during yogurt production could permit the control of aroma formation.

TI  == beneficial effects of a synbiotic supplement on self-perceived gastrointestinal well-being and immunoinflammatory status of healthy adults.
AB  == the use of synbiotics as health promoters is still poorly defined, and human intervention studies are scarce. this study was designed to evaluate the effects  of a commercialized synbiotic product containing lactobacillus acidophilus la5, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and fructooligosaccharides on the self-reported gastrointestinal well-being and the immunoinflammatory status of healthy human subjects. in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 women and 16 men (25-45 years old) received either three tablets per day of the synbiotic product (2.4 x 10(9) colony-forming units/day) or placebo during 6 weeks. gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were evaluated through a self-administered questionnaire. in those subjects suffering from any kind of digestive disturbance (mild dyspepsia,  flatulence, postprandial bloating, constipation, etc.), improvements in symptoms  after product consumption were also evaluated. blood lymphocyte subsets, phagocytic activity, serum c-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, and adhesion molecules concentrations were analyzed prior and after treatment. a significant improvement in overall self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habit was found in the synbiotic group. a marginal effect of treatment (analysis of variance p = .050) was observed with l-selectin, which showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group (p = .019). in addition, basal l-selectin levels  correlated with final intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1 levels (r = 0.468; p = .050), and basal icam-1 levels tended to correlate negatively with final l-selectin concentration (r = -0.457; p = .056). none of these correlations was found in the placebo group. the rest of the immunological parameters studied were not modified by the intervention. in conclusion, consumption of the synbiotic product improves self-perceived bowel habits and might facilitate a better profile of adhesion molecules in healthy adults.

TI  == impact of the metabolic activity of streptococcus thermophilus on the colon epithelium of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == the thermophilic lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus is widely and traditionally used in the dairy industry. despite the vast level of consumption of s. thermophilus through yogurt or probiotic functional food, very few data are available about its physiology in the gastrointestinal tract (git). the objective of the present work was to explore both the metabolic activity and host response  of s. thermophilus in vivo. our study profiles the protein expression of s. thermophilus after its adaptation to the git of gnotobiotic rats and describes the impact of s. thermophilus colonization on the colonic epithelium. s. thermophilus colonized progressively the git of germ-free rats to reach a stable  population in 30 days (10(8) cfu/g of feces). this progressive colonization suggested that s. thermophilus undergoes an adaptation process within git. indeed, we showed that the main response of s. thermophilus in the rat's git was  the massive induction of the glycolysis pathway, leading to formation of lactate  in the cecum. at the level of the colonic epithelium, the abundance of monocarboxylic acid transporter mrnas (slc16a1 and slc5a8) and a protein involved in the cell cycle arrest (p27(kip1)) increased in the presence of s. thermophilus compared with germ-free rats. based on different mono-associated rats harboring two different strains of s. thermophilus (lmd-9 or lmg18311) or weak lactate-producing commensal bacteria (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and ruminococcus gnavus), we propose that lactate could be a signal produced by s. thermophilus and modulating the colon epithelium.

TI  == in silico prediction of horizontal gene transfer in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == a combination of gene loss and acquisition through horizontal gene transfer (hgt) is thought to drive streptococcus thermophilus adaptation to its niche, i.e. milk. in this study, we describe an in silico analysis combining a stochastic data mining method, analysis of homologous gene distribution and the identification of features frequently associated with horizontally transferred genes to assess the proportion of the s. thermophilus genome that could originate from hgt. our mining approach pointed out that about 17.7% of s. thermophilus genes (362 cdss of 1,915) showed a composition bias; these genes were called 'atypical'. for 22% of them, their functional annotation strongly support their acquisition through hgt and consisted mainly in genes encoding mobile genetic recombinases, exopolysaccharide (eps) biosynthesis enzymes or resistance mechanisms to bacteriophages. the distribution of the atypical genes in the firmicutes phylum as well as in s. thermophilus species was sporadic and supported the hgt prediction for more than a half (52%, 189). among them, 46 were found specific to s. thermophilus. finally, by combining our method, gene annotation and sequence specific features, new genome islands were suggested in the s. thermophilus genome.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == hdcb, a novel enzyme catalysing maturation of pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase.
AB  == pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylases are produced as proenzymes that mature by cleavage followed by formation of the pyruvoyl prosthetic group. the histidine decarboxylation pathway of streptococcus thermophilus chcc1524 that consists of the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase hdca and the histidine/histamine exchanger hdcp was functionally expressed in lactococcus lactis. the operon encoding the pathway contains in addition to the hdca and hdcp genes a third gene hdcb. expression of different combinations of the genes in l.  lactis and escherichia coli followed by analysis of the protein products demonstrated the involvement of hdcb in the cleavage of the hdca proenzyme. the hdca proenzyme and hdcb protein were purified to homogeneity and cleavage and activation of the histidine decarboxylase activity was demonstrated in vitro. substoichiometric amounts of hdcb were required to cleave hdca showing that hdcb  functions as an enzyme. in agreement, expression levels of hdcb in the cells were low relative to those of hdca. the turnover number of hdcb in vitro was extremely low (0.05 min(-)(1)) which was due to a very slow association/dissociation of the enzyme/substrate complex. in fact, hdcb was shown to co-purify both with the hdca s82a mutant that mimics the proenzyme and with the mature hdca complex.

AB  == aim: this study identified protein-protein interactions among the biosynthetic machinery responsible for exopolysaccharide (eps) production in streptococcus thermophilus mr-1c. methods and results: protein-protein interactions were investigated using the yeast two-hybrid system. a strong protein-protein interaction was detected between the transmembrane activation protein wzd and the protein tyrosine kinase wze. weaker protein-protein interactions were detected between two duplicate wze proteins and between wze and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase wzh. protein-protein interactions involving a wzd/wze fusion protein  and wzd and wze may indicate that these proteins form multi-protein complexes. all combinations of the wzh, wzd, wze, wzg (regulation), cpse (glycosyl-1-phosphate transferase), cpss (polymerization), cpsl (unknown), cpsw (regulation) and cpsu (membrane translocation) were analysed for protein-protein  interactions but no additional interactions were discovered using the yeast two-hybrid system. conclusions: interactions among the phosphotyrosine phosphatase, tyrosine kinase, and transmembrane activation protein are important  in the regulation of capsule biosynthesis in strep. thermophilus mr-1c. significance and impact of the study: this study provides some valuable insight into the organization and interactions between the many proteins involved in eps  production. a better understanding of this process may facilitate the genetic manipulation of capsule production to impart desirable properties to dairy starter cultures.

TI  == effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == recognized to confer health benefits to consumers, probiotics such as lactobacillus acidophilus are commonly incorporated into fermented dairy products worldwide; among which yogurt is a popular delivery vehicle. to materialize most  of the putative health benefits associated with probiotics, an adequate amount of viable cells must be delivered at the time of consumption. however, the loss in their viabilities during refrigerated storage has been demonstrated previously. this study focused on the effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of five strains of l. acidophilus, with emphases on low ph and acid production. differential survival behavior between l. acidophilus strains was further analyzed. to this end, viable cell counts of l. acidophilus were determined weekly during 4 degrees c storage in various types of yogurts made with streptococcus thermophilus alone, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus alone, both species of the starter cultures, or glucono-delta-lactone (gdl). all yogurt types, except for pasteurized yogurts, were co-fermented with l. acidophilus. yogurt filtrate was analyzed for the presence of any inhibitory substance and for the amount of hydrogen peroxide. multiplication of l. acidophilus was not affected by the starter cultures as all strains reached high level on day 0 of the storage period. throughout the 28-day storage period, cell counts of l. acidophilus pim703 and sbt2062 remained steady (~6 x 10(7)cfu/g) in yogurts made  with both starter cultures, whereas those of atcc 700396 and ncfm were reduced by a maximum of 3 and 4.6 logs, respectively. when starter cultures were replaced by gdl, all strains survived well, suggesting that a low ph was not a critical factor dictating their survival. in addition, the filtrate collected from yogurts made with starter cultures appeared to have higher inhibitory activities against  l. acidophilus than that made with gdl. the presence of viable starter cultures was necessary to adversely affect the survival of some strains, as pasteurized yogurts had no effect on their survival. in particular, the inhibitory effect exerted by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus on l. acidophilus ncfm was highly pronounced than by s. thermophilus, nevertheless, the same effect was not observed on sbt2062. the inhibition against stationary-phase ncfm cells might be  caused by the elevated level of hydrogen peroxide produced by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. delineating factors driving the differences in survival trait among probiotic strains will lead to a more efficacious delivery of health benefits in  fermented dairy products through targeted technological interventions.

AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == alkalizing reactions streamline cellular metabolism in acidogenic microorganisms.
AB  == an understanding of the integrated relationships among the principal cellular functions that govern the bioenergetic reactions of an organism is necessary to determine how cells remain viable and optimise their fitness in the environment.  urease is a complex enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbonic acid. while the induction of urease activity by several microorganisms has been predominantly considered a stress-response that is initiated to generate a nitrogen source in response to a low environmental ph, here we demonstrate a new role of urease in the optimisation of cellular bioenergetics. we show that urea hydrolysis increases the catabolic efficiency of streptococcus thermophilus, a lactic acid bacterium that is widely used in the industrial manufacture of dairy products. by modulating the intracellular ph and thereby increasing the activity of beta-galactosidase, glycolytic enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase, urease increases the overall change in enthalpy generated by the bioenergetic reactions. a cooperative altruistic behaviour of urease-positive microorganisms on the urease-negative microorganisms within the same environment was also observed. the physiological role of a single enzymatic activity demonstrates a novel and unexpected view of the non-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that govern the bioenergetics of a bacterial cell, highlighting a new role for cytosol-alkalizing biochemical pathways in acidogenic microorganisms.

TI  == identification of genes for small non-coding rnas that belong to the regulon of the two-component regulatory system ciarh in streptococcus.
AB  == background: post-transcriptional regulation by small rnas (srnas) in bacteria is  now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence. in streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first srnas to be described were found in the regulon of the ciarh two-component regulatory system. five of these srnas were detected and designated csrnas for cia-dependent small rnas. ciarh pleiotropically affects beta-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. since ciarh is  highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csrnas are also included in the ciarh regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species. knowledge on the participation of csrnas in ciarh-dependent regulatory events will be the key to define the physiological  role of this important control system. results: genes for csrnas were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than s. pneumoniae by searching for ciar-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator. 61 different candidate genes were obtained specifying csrnas ranging in size from 51 to 202 nt. comparing these genes among each other revealed 40 different csrna types. all streptococcal genomes harbored csrna genes, their numbers varying between two and six. to validate these predictions, s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis were subjected  to csrna-specific northern blot analysis. in addition, a csrna gene from s. thermophilus plasmid pst0 introduced into s. pneumoniae was also tested. each of  the csrnas was detected on these blots and showed the anticipated sizes. thus, the method applied here is able to predict csrnas with high precision. conclusions: the results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding rnas, csrnas, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory  system ciarh in all streptococci.

TI  == a non-hydrolyzed, fermented milk formula reduces digestive and respiratory events in infants at high risk of allergy.
AB  == background/objectives: to determine the impact of a not hydrolyzed fermented infant formula containing heat-killed bifidobacterium breve c50 and streptococcus thermophilus 065 (hkbbst) on the incidence of allergy-like events during the first 2 years of life in children at high risk of atopy. subjects/methods: this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study included infants at high  risk of atopy. infants used hkbbst or a standard infant formula (sif) since birth until 1 year of age, and were followed at 4, 12 and 24 months after birth. skin prick tests (spts) for six foods and six aeroallergens were systematically performed and adverse events (aes) were recorded. in case of potentially allergic ae (paae), allergy could be further tested by spt, patch tests and quantification of specific iges. if cow's milk allergy (cma) was suspected, an oral challenge could also be performed. results: the study included 129 children, 63 were randomized to sif, 66 to hkbbst. the use of hkbbst milk did not alter the proportion of cma but decreased the proportion of positive spt to cow's milk (1.7 vs 12.5%, p=0.03), and the incidence of digestive (39 vs 63%, p=0.01) and respiratory potentially allergic aes (7 vs 21%, p=0.03) at 12 months, and that of respiratory paaes at 24 months (13 vs 35%, p=0.01). conclusions: hkbbst decreased the incidence of paaes in children with family history of atopy, during the first months of life and after the formula was stopped. oral tolerance to cow's milk in infants at high risk of atopy may therefore be improved using not hydrolyzed fermented formulae.

TI  == ftir-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional greek graviera cheese.
AB  == this study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (fourier transformed infra-red [ftir] spectroscopy) and molecular (rflp and sscp analysis of 16s rrna  genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (lab) flora present in traditional greek graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. a total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of tsaye (incubated at 30 degrees c), m-17 (22 degrees c) and m-17 (42 degrees c) agar media were clustered by ftir and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by  all methods. based on their ftir spectra, 282 isolates were lab grouped in 28 clusters. the lab species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and lactococcus lactis (0.7%). also, staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from tsaye. comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the lab species identified. the present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid ftir screening of 10-fold more  isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant lab species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.

TI  == the crispr/cas bacterial immune system cleaves bacteriophage and plasmid dna.
AB  == bacteria and archaea have developed several defence strategies against foreign nucleic acids such as viral genomes and plasmids. among them, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr) loci together with cas (crispr-associated) genes form the crispr/cas immune system, which involves partially palindromic repeats separated by short stretches of dna called spacers, acquired from extrachromosomal elements. it was recently demonstrated that these  variable loci can incorporate spacers from infecting bacteriophages and then provide immunity against subsequent bacteriophage infections in a sequence-specific manner. here we show that the streptococcus thermophilus crispr1/cas system can also naturally acquire spacers from a self-replicating plasmid containing an antibiotic-resistance gene, leading to plasmid loss. acquired spacers that match antibiotic-resistance genes provide a novel means to  naturally select bacteria that cannot uptake and disseminate such genes. we also  provide in vivo evidence that the crispr1/cas system specifically cleaves plasmid and bacteriophage double-stranded dna within the proto-spacer, at specific sites. our data show that the crispr/cas immune system is remarkably adapted to cleave invading dna rapidly and has the potential for exploitation to generate safer microbial strains.

TI  == probiotic yogurt effects on intestinal flora of patients with chronic liver disease.
AB  == background: patients with chronic liver disease generally have intestinal flora imbalance that is related to the development and worsening of the disease. objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic yogurt on intestinal flora of patients with chronic liver disease. methods: a randomized controlled trial, pretest-posttest control group design, was used. patients were randomized to an experimental group (41 patients) or a control group (40 patients). patients in the experimental group were given probiotic yogurt (one cup each time, three times per day for 14 days) containing bacillus bifidus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus within 2 hours after meals. levels of fecal flora, symptoms and signs, and laboratory examination indexes were collected. results: after intervention, the experimental group had a lower escherichia coli count and reduced intestinal flora imbalance (p < .05). comparison of the experimental and  control groups after the intervention showed that the former had improved symptoms and signs, including significant improvement in debilitation, food intake, appetite, abdominal distension, and ascitic fluid (p < .05). conclusion:  probiotic yogurt reduces the levels of intestinal flora imbalance and has an additional therapeutic effect on patients with chronic liver disease.

TI  == assessment of microbial populations dynamics in a blue cheese by culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the composition and development of microbial population during the manufacture and ripening of two batches of a blue-veined cheese was examined by culturing and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) (pcr-dgge). nine selective and/or differential media were used to track the cultivable populations of total and indicator microbial groups. for pcr-dgge, the v3 hyper variable region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and the eukaryotic d1 domain of 28s rdna were amplified with universal primers, specific for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. similarities and differences between the results obtained by the culturing and the molecular method were recorded for  some populations. culturing analysis allows minority microbial groups (coliforms, staphylococci) to be monitored, although in this study pcr-dgge identified a population of streptococcus thermophilus that went undetected by culturing. these results show that the characterization of the microbial populations interacting and evolving during the cheese-making process is improved by combining culturing  and molecular methods.

TI  == increasing competence in the genus streptococcus.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important model organisms for studies on natural genetic transformation in bacteria. the prevalence of this gene exchange mechanism in the genus streptococcus has not been subjected to systematic investigations, but it has been known for decades that only a few streptococcal species develop the competent state spontaneously when grown under  laboratory conditions. the recent discovery of a new mechanism regulating natural transformation in streptococcus thermophilus suggested that this property might be more widespread among streptococci than previously thought. this suspicion has been confirmed by mashburn-warren and co-workers, who in the current issue of molecular microbiology report the discovery of a novel competence-inducing pheromone that is conserved in streptococcus mutans and a number of pyogenic streptococci.

AB  == objective: to carry out isolation and the viable plate count of probiotics from yoghourt. to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of strains to penicillin, gentamicin, ampicillin, vancomycin, clindamycin and erythromycin. methods: probiotics were recovered and counted from yoghourt by plate count method. the recovered isolates were characterized by gram's stain, biochemical test, antimicrobial susceptibility test. results: mrs medium and (36 +/- 1) degrees c were the optimum condition of culture. in total, 52 probiotic isolates  were recovered from 31 yoghourt products, 12 (38.7%) products showed a lower probiotic quantity than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml of the national stantard, and 19 (61.3%) products were higher than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml. gram's stain showed that 37 isolates  were gram positive bacilli and 15 isolates were positive coccus. these 52 isolates were grouped into six species by biochemical method, including l. bulgaricus, s. thermophilus, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. all 52 isolates were susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin, one isolate was resistant to both clindamycin and erythromycin, four isolates were resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: most of yoghourt products contained sufficient viable probiotics as required by the national standard. a small quantity of isolates were resistant to some antimicrobials and multi -drug resistant isolates were also found.

TI  == bacillus subtilis cwlp of the sp-{beta} prophage has two novel peptidoglycan hydrolase domains, muramidase and cross-linkage digesting dd-endopeptidase.
AB  == for bacteria and bacteriophages, cell wall digestion by hydrolases is a very important event. we investigated one of the proteins involved in cell wall digestion, the yomi gene product (renamed cwlp). the gene is located in the sp-beta prophage region of the bacillus subtilis chromosome. inspection of the pfam database indicates that cwlp contains soluble lytic transglycosylase (slt) and peptidase m23 domains, which are similar to escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase slt70, and the staphylococcus aureus gly-gly endopeptidase lytm, respectively. the slt domain of cwlp exhibits hydrolytic activity toward the b. subtilis cell wall; however, reverse phase (rp)-hplc and mass spectrometry revealed that the cwlp-slt domain has only muramidase activity. in addition, the  peptidase m23 domain of cwlp exhibited hydrolytic activity and could cleave d-ala-diaminopimelic acid cross-linkage, a property associated with dd-endopeptidases. remarkably, the m23 domain of cwlp possessed a unique zn(2+)-independent endopeptidase activity; this contrasts with all other characterized m23 peptidases (and enzymes similar to cwlp), which are zn(2+) dependent. both domains of cwlp could hydrolyze the peptidoglycan and cell wall of b. subtilis. however, the m23 domain digested neither the peptidoglycans nor the cell walls of s. aureus or streptococcus thermophilus. the effect of defined  point mutations in conserved amino acid residues of cwlp is also determined.

TI  == two strains of nonstarter lactobacilli increased the production of flavor compounds in soft cheeses.
AB  == the contribution to flavor generation and secondary proteolysis of 2 strains of mesophilic lactobacilli isolated from cheese was studied. miniature soft cheeses  (200 g) were produced with or without the inclusion of a culture of lactobacillus plantarum i91 or lactobacillus casei i90 in the starter composed of streptococcus thermophilus. during ripening, cheeses containing the added lactobacilli showed an increased content of total free amino acids, but this increase was only significant in cheeses with lb. plantarum i91. in addition, free amino acid profiles were modified by selective increases of some amino acids, such as asp, ser, arg, leu, and phe. cheeses inoculated with lb. plantarum i91 or lb. casei i90 were also characterized by a significantly higher concentration of diacetyl,  a key flavor compound, and an increased content of acetoin. results suggest an increase in the catabolism of either citrate or aspartate, with the production of the derived aroma compounds. overall, aspartate content increased in both lactobacilli-added cheeses, whereas citrate was more or less constant, suggesting that aspartate could be the source of increased diacetyl and acetoin. a triangle  aroma test showed that the addition of the lactobacilli strains significantly changed the sensory attributes of cheeses. at least 11 of 12 panelists commented  that the aroma of cheeses with adjuncts was more buttery than that of control cheeses, which is desirable in most soft cheeses. both lb. plantarum i91 and lb.  casei i90 performed well as adjunct cultures by influencing cheese aroma development and cheese proteolysis.

TI  == mixed-culture transcriptome analysis reveals the molecular basis of mixed-culture growth in streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  == many food fermentations are performed using mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria. interactions between strains are of key importance for the performance  of these fermentations. yogurt fermentation by streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus (basonym, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) is one of the best-described mixed-culture fermentations. these species are believed to stimulate each other's growth by the exchange of metabolites such as  folic acid and carbon dioxide. recently, postgenomic studies revealed that an upregulation of biosynthesis pathways for nucleotides and sulfur-containing amino acids is part of the global physiological response to mixed-culture growth in s.  thermophilus, but an in-depth molecular analysis of mixed-culture growth of both  strains remains to be established. we report here the application of mixed-culture transcriptome profiling and a systematic analysis of the effect of  interaction-related compounds on growth, which allowed us to unravel the molecular responses associated with batch mixed-culture growth in milk of s. thermophilus cnrz1066 and l. bulgaricus atcc baa-365. the results indicate that interactions between these bacteria are primarily related to purine, amino acid,  and long-chain fatty acid metabolism. the results support a model in which formic acid, folic acid, and fatty acids are provided by s. thermophilus. proteolysis by l. bulgaricus supplies both strains with amino acids but is insufficient to meet  the biosynthetic demands for sulfur and branched-chain amino acids, as becomes clear from the upregulation of genes associated with these amino acids in mixed culture. moreover, genes involved in iron uptake in s. thermophilus are affected  by mixed-culture growth, and genes coding for exopolysaccharide production were upregulated in both organisms in mixed culture compared to monocultures. the confirmation of previously identified responses in s. thermophilus using a different strain combination demonstrates their generic value. in addition, the postgenomic analysis of the responses of l. bulgaricus to mixed-culture growth allows a deeper understanding of the ecology and interactions of this important industrial food fermentation process.

TI  == effect of bovine lactoferrin addition to milk in yogurt manufacturing.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the effect of milk supplementation with lactoferrin of different iron saturation on the manufacturing and characteristics of yogurt. bovine lactoferrin was added at concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml  in the holo (iron saturated) and apo (without iron) forms. some physicochemical properties, such as ph, concentration of lactic acid, and texture of supplemented yogurts, were determined throughout the shelf-life period storage (28 d) at 4 degrees c. we also evaluated the stability of lactoferrin in supplemented yogurt  throughout the storage time. the supplementation of milk with bovine lactoferrin  did not greatly affect the physical properties of the yogurt, though apo-lactoferrin slightly delayed the decrease of ph. this could be attributed to  the partial inhibition observed on the growth of streptococcus thermophilus. the  integrity and immunoreactive concentration of lactoferrin, determined by western  blotting and noncompetitive elisa, respectively, remained constant throughout the shelf life of yogurt.

AB  == a sensitive bacteria biosensor was prepared for the detection of trace lactate. the sensitive bioelement, lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus mixed culture, and palygorskite, a perfect matrix for bacteria, was co-immobilized on the surface of oxygen electrode. the biosensor possesses fine selective specificity, good sensitivity and longer operational life time, which were due to the mutual help relationship of symbiotic bacteria and 240 days acclimation with lactate as the carbon source. hydrodynamic amperometry, an advanced electrochemical method, is suitable for on-line monitoring the concentration change of dissolved oxygen that is closely accompanied with the metabolism of lactate. electrochemical data show that the current is very sensitive to the changes of the concentration of lactate. the response current was linear with lactic acid concentration in the range from 0 to 300mumol l(-1),  where the response time is no more than 240 s (r=0.9952), and the sensitivity was 1.87ma mol(-1)l. experiments show the biosensor is also very useful for long time on-line monitoring of lactate, such as fermentation progress.

TI  == microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of castelmagno pdo cheese.
AB  == the diversity, dynamics and activity of castelmagno pdo cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the grana valley (northwest italy), during the wintertime. samples of milk, curd and cheese (core  and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. in particular, dna and rna directly  extracted from the matrices were studied by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr-dgge. culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species streptococcus thermophilus and s. agalactiae. then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of castelmagno pdo ripening. at this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from lactobacillus plantarum and lb. casei. culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of l. lactis, actively involved in both castelmagno pdo manufacturing and ripening. despite lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a dgge band referred to this microorganism was detected, at rna level, in samples from ripened cheeses. on the other hand, lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of castelmagno  pdo cheese.

TI  == lactic acid fermentation of germinated barley fiber and proliferative function of colonic epithelial cells in loperamide-induced rats.
AB  == to develop a functional food from the dietary fiber fraction of germinated barley (hordeum vulgare l.) (gbf), lactic acid fermentation was attempted using lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium bifidus. the quality characteristics of the lactic acid-fermented product and its effect on gastrointestinal function in an animal model were examined. the anaerobic fermentation of 1% and 2% gbf yielded lactic acid bacteria at 8.9 +/- 1.0 x 10(8) and 1.6 +/- 0.2 x 10(9) colony-forming units/ml, and it was considered acceptable for consumption by sensory assessment. to determine the effect on gastrointestinal function, sprague-dawley rats were fed with three types of diets: a normal chow diet and chow diets supplemented with 10% lactic acid bacteria or a yogurt fermented with 2% gbf (gbfy). the rats fed gbfy for 6 weeks gained less body weight, excreted more fecal mass, and had improved gastrointestinal transit as examined with barium sulfate. the effect of gbfy on colonic epithelial proliferation was investigated through loperamide (lpm)-induced constipation in rats. the rats fed with gbfy for 6 weeks were intraperitoneally administered lpm twice daily for 7 days. gbfy supplementation decreased fecal excretion and moisture content in feces and depleted goblet cells as observed by hematoxylin and eosin stain. however, the rats supplemented with gbfy prior to the lpm administration had enhanced bowel movement, mucin secretion, and production of short-chain fatty acids compared with values for the lpm-alone group. immunohistochemistry revealed that the gbfy supplement increased the numbers of nuclei stained positively for ki-67 and extended from the base to  the middle zone of crypts. these results indicate that gbfy alleviates constipation via the proliferation of the colonic crypts in lpm-administered rats.

TI  == sequencing and transcriptional analysis of the streptococcus thermophilus histamine biosynthesis gene cluster: factors that affect differential hdca expression.
AB  == histamine, a toxic compound that is formed by the decarboxylation of histidine through the action of microbial decarboxylases, can accumulate in fermented food  products. from a total of 69 streptococcus thermophilus strains screened, two strains, chcc1524 and chcc6483, showed the capacity to produce histamine. the hdc clusters of s. thermophilus chcc1524 and chcc6483 were sequenced, and the factors that affect histamine biosynthesis and histidine-decarboxylating gene (hdca) expression were studied. the hdc cluster began with the hdca gene, was followed by a transporter (hdcp), and ended with the hdcb gene, which is of unknown function. the three genes were orientated in the same direction. the genetic organization of the hdc cluster showed a unique organization among the lactic acid bacterial group and resembled those of staphylococcus and clostridium species, thus indicating possible acquisition through a horizontal transfer mechanism. transcriptional analysis of the hdc cluster revealed the existence of  a polycistronic mrna covering the three genes. the histidine-decarboxylating gene (hdca) of s. thermophilus demonstrated maximum expression during the stationary growth phase, with high expression levels correlated with high histamine levels.  limited expression was evident during the lag and exponential growth phases. low-temperature (4 degrees c) incubation of milk inoculated with a histamine-producing strain showed lower levels of histamine than did inoculated milk kept at 42 degrees c. this reduction was attributed to a reduction in the activity of the hdca enzyme itself rather than a reduction in gene expression or  the presence of a lower cell number.

TI  == specific metabolic activity of ripening bacteria quantified by real-time reverse  transcription pcr throughout emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  == bacterial communities of fermented foods are usually investigated by culture-dependent methods. real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) and reverse transcription (rt)-qpcr offer new possibilities to quantify the populations present and their metabolic activity. the aim of this work was to develop qpcr and rt-qpcr methods to assess the metabolic activity and the stress level of the  two species used as ripening cultures in emmental cheese manufacture, propionibacterium freudenreichii and lactobacillus paracasei. three small scale (1/100) microbiologically controlled emmental cheeses batches were manufactured and inoculated with lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, p. freudenreichii and l. paracasei. at 12 steps of cheese manufacture and ripening,  the populations of p. freudenreichii and l. paracasei were quantified by numerations on agar media and by qpcr. 16s, tuf and grol transcript levels were quantified by rt-qpcr. sampling was carried out in triplicate. qpcr and rt-qpcr assessments were specific, efficient and linear. the quantification limit was 10(3) copies of cells or cdna/g of cheese. cell quantifications obtained by qpcr  gave similar results than plate count for p. freudenreichii growth and 0.5 to 1 log lower in the stationary phase. bacterial counts and qpcr quantifications showed that l. paracasei began to grow during the pressing step while p. freudenreichii began to grow from the beginning of ripening (in the cold room). tuf cdna quantification results suggested that metabolic activity of l. paracasei reached a maximum during the first part of the ripening (in cold room) and decreased progressively during ripening (in the warm room). metabolic activity of p. freudenreichii was maximum at the end of cold ripening room and was stable during the first two weeks in warm room. after lactate exhaustion (after two weeks of warm room), the number of tuf cdna decreased reflecting reduced metabolic activity. for l. paracasei, grol cdna were stable during ripening. for  p. freudenreichii, grol1 gene was highly-expressed during acidification, while grol2 gene highly expression was only observed at the end of the ripening stage after lactate (carbon substrate of p. freudenreichii) exhaustion. the potential use of 16s and tuf genes for the normalization of cdna quantification throughout  an emmental cheese manufacture is discussed. for the first time, specific gene expression was performed by rt-qpcr yielding metabolic activity and stress response evaluation for l. paracasei and p. freudenreichii in cheese.

TI  == effect of exopolysaccharide-producing strains of streptococcus thermophilus on technological attributes of fat-free lassi.
AB  == sixty-four exopolysaccharide-producing thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from traditionally made indian fermented milk products. on the basis of morphological and biochemical tests, these isolates were identified as the species of lactobacillus, streptococcus, and enterococcus genera. initial screening for technological attributes revealed that streptococcus thermophilus ig16 was a promising isolate, and produced both capsular and ropy polysaccharides at the concentration of 211 mg/l. exopolysaccharide produced by ig16 was a heteropolysaccharide containing rhamnose and galactose in a ratio of 5.3:1 and had a molecular weight of 3.3 x 10(4) da. use of ig16 as a starter culture controlled whey separation and improved viscosity, flavor, consistency, and color and appearance of lassi. use of ig16 resulted in lassi having optimal acidity, less syneresis, high viscosity, and better scores for flavor, consistency, and color and appearance.

TI  == viability of bifidobacteria strains in yogurt with added oat beta-glucan and corn starch during cold storage.
AB  == probiotics must be consumed at a level of 10(7) cfu/ml for successful colonization of the gut. in yogurts containing beneficial cultures, the survival  of probiotic strains can quickly decline below this critical concentration during cold storage. we hypothesized that beta-glucan would increase the viability of bifidobacteria strains in yogurt during cold storage. yogurts were produced containing 0.44% beta-glucan (concentrated or freeze-dried) extracted from whole  oat flour and/or 1.33% modified corn starch, and bifidobacteria (b. breve or b. longum) at a concentration of at least 10(9) cfu/ml. all yogurts were stored at 4 degrees c. bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbureckii subsp. bulgaricus, were enumerated from undisturbed aliquots before fermentation, after fermentation, and once a week for 5 wk. s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus maintained a concentration of at least 10(8) cfu/ml in yogurts containing concentrated or freeze-dried beta-glucan regardless  of starch addition, and in the control with no added beta-glucan or starch. similarly, the probiotic, bifidobacterium breve, survived above a therapeutic level in all treatments. the addition of beta-glucan prolonged the survival of bifidobacterium longum at a concentration of at least 10(7) cfu/ml by up to 2 wk  on average beyond the control. further, the inclusion of concentrated beta-glucan in yogurt improved survival of b. longum above 10(7) cfu/ml by 1 wk longer than did freeze-dried beta-glucan. study results suggest that beta-glucan has a protective effect on bifidobacteria in yogurt when stressed by low-temperature storage.

TI  == microbial stability and safety of traditional greek graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  == the microflora of four batches of traditional greek graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. the cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known lab bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by pcr. all batches were safe according to the european union regulatory criteria for listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. the cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant lab from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. sixteen e. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. in accordance, enterocin b gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin p gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin a, b, p, 31, l50a, and l50b genes. plantaricin a gene  was also amplified from all cheeses. mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional graviera cheese products, with lab bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.

TI  == inhibition of dynamin-dependent endocytosis interferes with type iii ifn expression in bacteria-infected human monocyte-derived dcs.
AB  == type i ifns (ifn-alpha/betas) and type iii ifns (ifn-lambda1-3) play an important role in host defense against viral infections. the induction of type i ifns has recently been found to take place also in bacterial infections, and therefore, this study focuses on analyzing the regulation of type iii ifns in response to bacterial stimulation. we found by quantitative rt-pcr that the expression of ifn-lambda1 and ifn-lambda2/3 mrnas, as well as that of ifn-beta, was similarly up-regulated in response to stimulation with live salmonella typhimurium or tlr4  agonist lps in human modcs. the induction of ifn-lambda mrnas did not require ongoing protein synthesis, and only ifn-lambda1 was detected at the protein level. the induction of ifn-lambda mrnas was sensitive to sb202190, ly294002, and pdtc, which inhibit p38 mapk, pi3k, and nf-kappab activation, respectively. furthermore, we observed that blocking dynamin-dependent endocytosis pathways with dynasore led to decreased cell surface expression of cd86 and hla class ii molecules and reduced production of ifn-lambda1, cxcl10, and il-6 when the cells  were infected with s. typhimurium. cytokine production was also impaired in dynasore-treated, streptococcus thermophilus-stimulated cells. further, inhibition of dynamin prevented s. typhimurium-induced phosphorylation of irf3 and the internalization of the bacteria. in summary, induction of type iii ifns in bacteria-infected human modcs requires multiple signaling pathways and involves bacterial phagocytosis.

TI  == effects of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria on the antigenicity of bovine whey proteins.
AB  == background: the main whey proteins alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-la) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) are considered as the major allergens in cow's milk. microbial fermentation can produce some proteolytic enzymes, which can induce the degradation of milk protein allergens. in this study, the effects of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria on the antigenicity of alpha-la and beta-lg were investigated using indirect competitive elisa. meanwhile, the proteolysis of milk proteins was detected by tnbs assay and sds-page electrophoresis. results: fermentation by lactic acid bacteria could significantly reduce the antigenicity  of alpha-la and beta-lg in skim milk. combined strains of lactobacillus helveticus and streptococcus thermophilus were the most effective in reducing the antigenicity of both whey proteins. in addition, alpha-la and beta-lg antigenicity decreased to a lower value at 6 h of fermentation and at 0.5 d of cold storage by fermentation with the combined strains. the results of tnbs assay and sds-page electrophoresis showed that lactic acid bacteria strains used in this study hydrolysed whey proteins only to a limited extent. conclusion: the fermentation with lactic acid bacteria is an effective way to reduce whey proteins antigenicity.

TI  == proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry monitoring of the evolution of volatile compounds during lactic acid fermentation of milk.
AB  == we apply, for first time, the recently developed proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ptr-tof-ms) apparatus as a rapid method for the monitoring of lactic acid fermentation (laf) of milk. ptr-tof-ms has been proposed as a very fast, highly sensitive and versatile technique but there have  been no reports of its application to dynamic biochemical processes with relevance to the food industry. laf is a biochemical-physicochemical dynamic process particularly relevant for the dairy industry as it is an important step in the production of many dairy products. further, laf is important in the utilization of the by-products of the cheese industry, such as whey wastewaters.  we show that ptr-tof-ms is a powerful method for the monitoring of major volatile organic chemicals (vocs) formed or depleted during laf, including acetaldehyde, diacetyl, acetoin and 2-propanone, and it also provides information about the evolution of minor vocs such as acetic acid, 2,3-pentanedione, ethanol, and off-flavor related vocs such as dimethyl sulfide and furfural. this can be very important considering that the conventional measurement of ph decrease during laf is often ineffective due to the reduced response of ph electrodes resulting from  the formation of protein sediments. solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (spme-gc/ms) data on the inoculated milk base and final fermented product are also presented to supporting peak identification. we demonstrate that ptr-tof-ms can be used as a rapid, efficient and non-invasive method for the monitoring of laf from headspace, supplying important data about the quality of the final product and that it may be used to monitor the efficacy  of manufacturing practices.

TI  == food processing increases casein resistance to simulated infant digestion.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine whether processing could modify the  resistance of casein (cn) to digestion in infants. a range of different dairy matrices was manufactured from raw milk in a pilot plant and subjected to in vitro digestion using an infant gut model. digestion products were identified using ms and immunochemical techniques. results obtained showed that cns were able to resist digestion, particularly kappa- and alphas(2)-cn. resistant areas were identified and corresponded to fragments hydrophobic at ph 3.0 (gastric conditions) and/or carrying post-translational modifications (phosphorylation and glycosylation). milk processing led to differences in peptide patterns and heat treatment of milk tended to increase the number of peptides found in digested samples. this highlights the likely impact of milk processing on the allergenic potential of cns.

TI  == genetic and proteomic analysis of factors affecting serum cholesterol reduction by lactobacillus acidophilus a4.
AB  == this article identifies novel factors involved in cholesterol reduction by probiotic bacteria, which were identified using genetic and proteomic approaches. approximately 600 lactobacillus acidophilus a4 mutants were created by random mutagenesis. the cholesterol-reducing ability of each mutant was determined and verified using two different methods: the o-phthalaldehyde assay and gas chromatographic analysis (gc). among screened mutants, strain ba9 showed a dramatically diminished ability to reduce cholesterol, as demonstrated by a 7.7%  reduction rate, while the parent strain had a more than 50% reduction rate. the transposon insertion site was mapped using inverse pcr (i-pcr), and it was determined using bioinformatic methods that the deleted region contained the streptococcus thermophilus catabolite control protein a gene (ccpa). in addition, we have shown using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) that several proteins, including a transcription regulator, fmn-binding protein, major facilitator superfamily permease, glycogen phosphorylase, the yknv protein, and fructose/tagatose bisphosphate aldolase, were strongly regulated by the ccpa gene. in addition, in vivo experiments investigating ccpa function were conducted with rats. rats fed wild-type l. acidophilus a4 showed a greater than 20% reduction in total serum cholesterol, but rats fed ba9 mutant l. acidophilus showed only an approximately 10% reduction in cholesterol. these results provide  important insights into the mechanism by which these lactic acid bacteria reduce  cholesterol.

TI  == folate: a functional food constituent.
AB  == folate, a water-soluble vitamin, includes naturally occurring food folate and synthetic folic acid in supplements and fortified foods. mammalian cells cannot synthesize folate and its deficiency has been implicated in a wide variety of disorders. a number of reviews have dwelt up on the health benefits associated with increased folate intakes and many countries possess mandatory folate enrichment programs. lately, a number of studies have shown that high intakes of  folic acid, the chemically synthesized form, but not natural folates, can cause adverse effects in some individuals such as the masking of the hematological manifestations of vitamin b(12) deficiency, leukemia, arthritis, bowel cancer, and ectopic pregnancies. as fermented milk products are reported to contain even  higher amounts of folate produced by the food-grade bacteria, primarily lactic acid bacteria (lab), the focus has primarily shifted toward the natural folate, that is, folate produced by lab and levels of folate present in foods fermented by/or containing these valuable microorganisms. the proper selection and use of folate-producing microorganisms is an interesting strategy to increase "natural"  folate levels in foods. an attempt has been made through this review to share information available in the literature on wide ranging aspects of folate, namely, bioavailability, analysis, deficiency, dietary requirements, and health effects of synthetic and natural folate, dairy and nondairy products as a potential source of folate, microorganisms with special reference to streptococcus thermophilus as prolific folate producer, and recent insight on modulation of folate production levels in lab by metabolic engineering.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

AB  == optimization of the cultivation conditions and medium components for folate production by the highest folate producing streptococcus thermophilus strain rd102 was carried out using a 23 central composite design and surface modelling method of response surface methodology. as folate production was observed to be growth-associated, hence the desired responses selected for the optimization were both folate production and growth. the selected factors based on preliminary investigations were incubation period, concentrations of p-amino benzoic acid (paba) the growth precursor, and lactose as carbon source. the optimum concentrations of paba and lactose were found to be 300 micropm and 3% respectively at 72 h incubation. the optimized conditions resulted in an increase in folate production by 26% compared with control conditions (0% paba and lactose at 37 degrees c). using the method of experimental factorial design and response  surface analysis, it was possible to determine optimal operating conditions to obtain a higher folate production by strep. thermophilus. therefore, this study constitutes a step in developing strategies to modulate the folate level to a higher level.

AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase from dairy streptococcus thermophilus strain lmd9 was cloned, sequenced and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant enzyme was purified and showed high specific activity of 464 u/mg. this protein displays a homotetrameric arrangement composed of four 118 kda monomers. monitoring of the activity showed that this enzyme was optimally active at a wide range of temperatures (25-40 degrees c) and at ph from 6.5 to 7.5. immobilization of the recombinant e. coli in alginate beads clearly enhanced the enzyme activity at various temperatures, including 4 and 50 degrees c, and at ph values from 4.0  to 8.5. stability studies indicated that this biocatalyst has high stability within a broad range of temperatures and ph. this stability was improved not only by addition of 1 mm of mn(2+) and 1.2 mm mg(2+), but essentially through immobilization. the remarkable bioconversion rates of lactose in milk and whey at different temperatures revealed the attractive catalytic efficiency of this enzyme, thus promoting its use for lactose hydrolysis in milk and other dairy products.

AB  == bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). target dna bands were identified  according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. comigrating bands present in the dgge profiles were resolved by species-specific pcr. the results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. the dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. frequently encountered bacterial species were enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus kitasatonis, and lactobacillus kefiri. leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus,  lactobacillus buchneri, and lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. in addition, l. buchneri, l. jensenii, and l. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for  the first time in the xinjiang koumiss. furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on m17, de man-rogosa-sharpe, halligan-pearce, and kenner fecal media. the results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained  by the dgge analysis. this is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.

TI  == physical properties of acid milk gels prepared at 37 degrees c up to gelation but at different incubation temperatures for the remainder of fermentation.
AB  == we investigated the effect of altering temperature immediately after gels were formed at 37 degrees c. we defined instrumentally measurable gelation (img) as the point at which gels had a storage modulus (g') > or = 5pa. gels were made at  constant incubation temperature (it) of 37 degrees c up to img, and then cooled to 30 or 33.5, or heated to 40.5 or 44 degrees c, at a rate of 1 degrees c/min and maintained at those temperatures until ph 4.6. control gel was made at 37 degrees c (i.e., no temperature change during gelation/gel development). gel formation was monitored using small strain dynamic oscillatory rheology, and the  resulting structure and physical properties at ph 4.6 were studied by fluorescence microscopy, large deformation rheology, whey separation (ws), and permeability (b). a single strain of streptococcus thermophilus was used to avoid variations in the ratios of strains that could have resulted from changes in temperature during fermentation. total time required to reach ph 4.6 was similar  for samples made at constant it of 37 degrees c or by cooling after img from 37 to either 30 or 33.5 degrees c, but gels heated to 40 or 44 degrees c needed less time to reach ph 4.6. cooling gels after img resulted in an increase in g' values at ph 4.6, a decrease in lt(max), ws, and b, and an increase in the area of protein aggregates of micrographs compared with the control gel made at constant  it of 37 degrees c. heating gels after img resulted in a decrease in g' values at ph 4.6 and an increase in lt(max) values and ws. the physical properties of acid  milk gels were dominated by the temperature profile during the gel-strengthening  phase that occurs after img. this study indicates that the final properties of yogurt greatly depend on the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, time/rate of ph change) experienced by the casein particles/clusters during the critical early gel development phase when bonding between and within particles is still labile. cooling of gels may encourage inter-cluster strand formation, whereas heating of gels may promote intra-cluster fusion and the breakage of strands between clusters.

TI  == intra- and interlaboratory performances of two commercial antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods for bifidobacteria and nonenterococcal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == in a small-scale harmonization study involving nine laboratories in eight european countries, the intra- and interlaboratory performances of two commercially available systems, i.e., the vetmic microplate system and etest, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of nonenterococcal lactic acid bacteria (nelab) and bifidobacteria were analyzed. in addition, one laboratory also performed standard broth microdilution as a reference method. mics of tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin, gentamicin, clindamycin, and streptomycin for the type strains of 25 species of nelab and bifidobacteria and mics of vancomycin for a selection of relevant taxa were determined. the previously described lactic acid bacterium susceptibility test medium (lsm) and related mixed-medium formulations, all including iso-sensitest broth as a basic component, were used as test media. the overall agreement of median mic ranges +/- 1 log(2) dilution determined by the vetmic and etest methods with the median  mics determined by the reference method was very good for tetracycline, ampicillin, and streptomycin (92.3 to 100%) but low for erythromycin (19.5 to 30.7%) and clindamycin (50.0 to 80.8%). there was a consensus among the participating laboratories that vetmic was preferred over etest because of its lower cost, better growth support, and more uniform criteria for mic end point reading. with the range for acceptable intralaboratory reproducibility being defined as the median mic +/- 1 log(2) dilution, vetmic results (with 69.2% of all data sets in the acceptable range) were shown to display greater reproducibility than etest results (with 58.8% of all data sets in the acceptable range). also at the interlaboratory level, the proportion of mic values obtained  with vetmic that belonged to the complete agreement category (60.0%) was higher than the proportion of such values obtained with etest (47.0%), which indicates a higher degree of interlaboratory reproducibility for the former method. apart from some agent-specific effects, the majority of vetmic and etest replicate data sets were situated within a 1- to 2-log(2) dilution range, suggesting that the two methods can be considered to be equivalent for recognizing resistance phenotypes. this multicenter study has further validated the standard use of lsm  and related mixed-medium formulations with commercially available systems and formed the basis for the ongoing development of the iso 10932/idf 223 standard for susceptibility testing of nelab and bifidobacteria.

TI  == therapeutic effect of streptococcus thermophilus crl 1190-fermented milk on chronic gastritis.
AB  == aim: to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus (s. thermophilus) crl 1190 fermented milk on chronic gastritis in balb/c mice. methods: balb/c mice were fed with the  fermented milk for 7 d after inducing gastritis with acetyl-salicylic acid (asa,  400 mg/kg body weight per day for 10 d). omeprazole was included in this study as a positive therapeutic control. the gastric inflammatory activity was evaluated from gastric histology and inflammation score, number of interleukin-10 (il-10),  interferon-gamma (infgamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) cytokine-producing cells in the gastric mucosa, and thickness of the mucus layer. results: animals receiving treatment with the eps-producing s. thermophilus crl 1190 fermented milk showed a conserved gastric mucosa structure similar to that of healthy animals. inflammation scores of the fermented milk-treated mice were lower than those of mice in the gastritis group (0.2 + or - 0.03 vs 2.0 + or - 0.6, p < 0.05). a marked decrease in infgamma(+) (15 + or - 1.0 vs 28 + or - 1.2, p < 0.05) and tnf-alpha(+) (16 + or - 3.0 vs 33 + or - 3.0, p < 0.05) cells and an increase in il-10(+) (28 + or - 1.5 vs 14 + or - 1.3, p < 0.05) cells compared to the gastritis group, was observed. also, an increase in the thickness of the mucus gel layer (2.2 + or - 0.6 vs 1.0 + or - 0.3; 5.1 + or - 0.8 vs 1.5 + or - 0.4 in the corpus and antrum mucosa, respectively, p < 0.05) compared with the gastritis group was noted. a milk suspension of the purified eps from s. thermophilus crl1190 was also effective as therapy for gastritis. conclusion: this study suggests that fermented milk with s. thermophilus crl 1190 and/or its  eps could be used in novel functional foods as an alternative natural therapy for chronic gastritis induced by asa.

TI  == characterisation of proteolysis profile of argentinean sheep cheeses made by two  different production methods.
AB  == background: in this work the proteolysis profiles of argentinean sheep cheeses made by two different production methods were studied in order to develop products with typical and defined features. cheeses with a starter of streptococcus thermophilus, curd cut to corn grain size, washed and heated to 43  degrees c (s cheeses) and cheeses with a mixed starter of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, curd cut to  rice grain size, unwashed and heated to 47 degrees c (l cheeses) were manufactured. the cheeses were ripened at 12 degrees c and 80% relative humidity  for 180 days and samples were taken throughout this period. results: gross composition and primary proteolysis were similar for both types of cheeses. streptococci counts diminished from 10(9) to 10(7) colony-forming units g(-1) during ripening in both s and l cheeses. lactobacilli counts in l cheeses decreased during ripening and disappeared at 180 days. l cheeses had significantly lower ph values and showed higher peptidolysis than s cheeses. triangle sensory evaluation indicated important differences between the two types of cheeses. conclusion: s cheeses had a low proteolysis level and a soft flavour, making them appropriate for consumption after a short ripening time. l cheeses had a higher proteolysis level and more intense sensory characteristics, making them appropriate for consumption after a longer ripening time.

TI  == identification and characterization of the dominant lactic acid bacteria from kurut: the naturally fermented yak milk in qinghai, china.
AB  == forty-three samples of kurut, a kind of traditional naturally-fermented yak milk, were collected in qinghai, china. one hundred and forty-eight lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains were isolated and identified from the kurut samples according to phenotypic characterization and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. among them, 52 isolates belonged to the lactobacillus strains. ninety-six isolates were resolved to coccoid lab. the results showed that these isolates belonged to five genera and thirteen different species and subspecies. moreover,  lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus were the predominant population in these samples. this paper systematically studied the composition of lab in kurut, which may provide raw data for further study involving probiotics strain selection and starter culture design for industrialization production of traditional fermented milk in the future.

TI  == role of antioxidant enzymes in bacterial resistance to organic acids.
AB  == growth in aerobic environments has been shown to generate reactive oxygen species (ros) and to cause oxidative stress in most organisms. antioxidant enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutases and hydroperoxidases) and dna repair mechanisms provide protection against ros. acid stress has been shown to be associated with the induction of mn superoxide dismutase (mnsod) in lactococcus lactis and staphylococcus aureus. however, the relationship between acid stress and oxidative stress is not well understood. in the present study, we showed that mutations in the gene coding for mnsod (soda) increased the toxicity of lactic acid at ph 3.5 in streptococcus thermophilus. the inclusion of the iron chelators 2,2'-dipyridyl (dip), diethienetriamine-pentaacetic acid (dtpa), and o-phenanthroline (o-phe) provided partial protection against 330 mm lactic acid at ph 3.5. the results suggested that acid stress triggers an iron-mediated oxidative stress that can be ameliorated by mnsod and iron chelators. these findings were further validated in escherichia coli strains lacking both mnsod and iron sod (fesod) but expressing a heterologous mnsod from s. thermophilus. we also found that, in e. coli, fesod did not provide the same protection afforded by mnsod and that hydroperoxidases are equally important in protecting the cells  against acid stress. these findings may explain the ability of some microorganisms to survive better in acidified environments, as in acid foods, during fermentation and accumulation of lactic acid or during passage through the low ph of the stomach.

TI  == exploiting plants for glutathione (gsh) production: uncoupling gsh synthesis from cellular controls results in unprecedented gsh accumulation.
AB  == glutathione (gsh) is a key factor for cellular redox homeostasis and tolerance against abiotic and biotic stress (may et al., 1998; noctor et al., 1998a). previous attempts to increase gsh content in plants have met with moderate success (rennenberg et al., 2007), largely because of tight and multilevel control of its biosynthesis (rausch et al., 2007). here, we report the in planta  expression of the bifunctional gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase-glutathione synthetase enzyme from streptococcus thermophilus (stgcl-gs), which is shown to be neither redox-regulated nor sensitive to feedback inhibition by gsh. transgenic tobacco plants expressing stgcl-gs under control of a constitutive promoter reveal an extreme accumulation of gsh in their leaves (up to 12 micromol gsh/gfw, depending on the developmental stage), which is more than 20- to 30-fold above the levels observed in wild-type (wt) plants and which can be even further  increased by additional sulphate fertilization. surprisingly, this dramatically increased gsh production has no impact on plant growth while enhancing plant tolerance to abiotic stress. furthermore, stgcl-gs-expressing plants are a novel, cost-saving source for gsh production, being competitive with current yeast-based systems (li et al., 2004).

TI  == pecorino crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal pecorino crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using restriction fragment length polymorphism and were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout  cheese ripening, with the dominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus species. bacterial dynamics determined by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in  the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus buchneri and leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of pecorino crotonese cheeses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.

TI  == effects of fermentation conditions and soybean peptide supplementation on hyaluronic acid production by streptococcus thermophilus strain yit 2084 in milk.
AB  == to increase the hyaluronic acid (ha) yield from streptococcus thermophilus yit 2084, fermentation conditions (ph, temperature, agitation, aeration) were optimized in milk-based medium, and the effects of supplemental soybean peptides, which have different molecular weight distributions, were determined. ha production was enhanced to approximately 100 mg/l at ph 6.8 and 33-40 degrees c.  agitation speed and aeration rate slightly affected ha production. soybean peptides including those of high molecular weight (approximately 27 to 130 kda) further increased ha production to 208 mg/l under the optimal condition (ph 6.8,  35 degrees c, 100 rpm), which was 20-fold greater than non-optimal condition. ha  production was no longer related to the specific growth rate. the ha produced under the optimal condition included a large amount of high-molecular-weight fraction of 100 to 2000 kda, compared with under the basal condition without optimization.

TI  == potassium-activated gtpase reaction in the g protein-coupled ferrous iron transporter b.
AB  == feob is a prokaryotic membrane protein responsible for the import of ferrous iron (fe(2+)). a defining feature of feob is that it includes an n-terminal 30-kda soluble domain with gtpase activity, which is required for iron transport. however, the low intrinsic gtp hydrolysis rate of this domain appears to be too slow for feob either to function as a channel or to possess an active fe(2+) membrane transport mechanism. here, we present crystal structures of the soluble  domain of feob from streptococcus thermophilus in complex with gdp and with the gtp analogue derivative 2'-(or -3')-o-(n-methylanthraniloyl)-beta,gamma-imidoguanosine 5'-triphosphate (mant-gmppnp). unlike recent structures of the g protein domain, the mant-gmppnp-bound structure shows clearly resolved, active conformations of the critical switch motifs. importantly, biochemical analyses demonstrate that the gtpase activity of feob is activated by k(+), which leads to a 20-fold acceleration in its hydrolysis rate. analysis of the structure identified a conserved asparagine residue likely to be involved in k(+) coordination, and mutation of this residue abolished k(+)-dependent activation. we suggest that this, together with a second asparagine residue that we show is critical for the  structure of the switch i loop, allows the prediction of k(+)-dependent activation in g proteins. in addition, the accelerated hydrolysis rate opens up the possibility that feob might indeed function as an active transporter.

TI  == pategras cheese as a suitable carrier for six probiotic cultures.
AB  == the viability of five single-strain and one three-strain probiotic cultures was assessed during pategras cheese ripening. probiotics were inoculated into cheese-milk after a pre-incubation step - intended to improve their survival - or directly as a lyophilised culture; control cheeses without probiotics were also obtained. ph of probiotic and control cheeses was similar, except in probiotic cheeses containing the strain lb. acidophilus b or the mixed culture. in these cases, the probiotic cheeses were more acid than their respective control cheeses. all the probiotics tested maintained counts above 107 cfu/g during the shelf-life settled for the product. strains of the lb. casei group: lb. paracasei, lb. casei and lb. rhamnosus reached and kept the highest cell concentration during cheese ripening, followed by lb. acidophilus and bifidobacteria. the direct addition of the probiotic cultures was more efficient  than their inoculation after a pre-incubation step, for all the probiotics assayed. we have provided evidence that support the use of pategras cheese as a performing food-based vehicle for probiotic bacteria.

TI  == cpg oligodeoxynucleotides induce strong up-regulation of interleukin 33 via toll-like receptor 9.
AB  == we previously reported the strong immunostimulatory effects of a cpg oligodeoxynucleotide (odn), designated msst, from the lacz gene of streptococcus  (s.) thermophilus atcc19258. here we show that 24h of stimulation with msst in mouse splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages strongly induces expression of interleukin (il)-33, a cytokine in the il-1 superfamily. other il-1 superfamily members, including il-1alpha, il-1beta and il-18, are down-regulated after 24h of stimulation of msst. we also found that msst-induced il-33 mrna expression is inhibited by the suppressive odn a151, which can inhibit toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9)-mediated responses. this is the first report to show that il-33 can be induced by cpg odns. the strong induction of il-33 by msst suggests that it may be a potential therapeutic odn for the treatment of inflammatory disease. the presence of a strong cpg odn in s. thermophilus also suggests that the bacterium  may be a good candidate as a starter culture for the development of new physiologically functional foods.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

AB  == the cumulative effect of peptidase and protease activities associated with cells  of streptococcus thermophilus (st) and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (lb) was evaluated on the milk protein-based antimicrobial peptides casocidin and isracidin. reaction mixtures of casocidin or isracidin and nonproliferating mid-log cells of these essential yogurt starter cultures were individually incubated for up to 4 h at ph 4.5 and 7.0, and samples removed at various time points were analyzed by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc) and maldi-tof/tof-ms. both casocidin and isracidin remained largely unchanged following exposure to cell suspensions of st or lb strains at ph 4.5. casocidin was extensively degraded by both st and lb strains at ph 7.0, whereas isracidin remained largely intact after incubation for 4 h with st strains but was degraded by exposure to lb strains. the results showed the feasibility of using the bovine casein-based peptides casocidin and isracidin as food grade antimicrobial supplements to impart fermented dairy foods additional protection against bacterial contamination. the structural integrity and efficacy of these biodefensive peptides may be preserved by timing their addition near the end of the fermentation of yogurt-like dairy foods (at or below ph 4.5), when conditions for bacterial proteolytic activity become unfavorable.

AB  == objective: to identify the antimicrobial resistance of commercial lactic acid bacteria present in microbial foods and drug additives by analyzing their isolated strains used for fermentation and probiotics. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility of 41 screened isolates was tested with disc diffusion and e-test  methods after species-level identification. resistant strains were selected and examined for the presence of resistance genes by pcr. results: distribution of resistance was found in different species. all isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalothin, and imipenem. in addition, isolates resistant to vancomycin, rifampicin, streptomycin, bacitracin, and erythromycin were detected, although the incidence of resistance to these antibiotics was relatively low. in contrast, most strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, and gentamycin. the genes msrc, vanx, and dfra were detected in strains of enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactococcus lactis. conclusion: antibiotic resistance is present in different species of probiotic strains, which poses a threat to food safety. evaluation of the safety of lactic acid bacteria for human consumption should be guided by established criteria, guidelines and regulations.

TI  == a microfluidic approach for high efficiency extraction of low molecular weight rna.
AB  == the lack of sample pre-treatment concepts that are easily automatable, miniaturized and highly efficient for both small volumes and low target concentrations, is one of the key issues that block the road towards effective miniaturized diagnostic instruments. this paper presents a novel, highly efficient and simple method for low-molecular weight rna extraction using electricity only. cells are lysed by thermo-electric lysis and rna is purified using a gel-electrophoretic purification step. the combination of the two steps in one integrated cartridge reduces the time frame between the two steps, thus protecting rna from enzymatic degradation. a disposable chip solution is proposed using a novel dry film resist laminate technology that allows cheap, large-scale  fabrication. the chip contains crucial microfluidic innovations that allow for a  simple user interface, reproducible functioning and precise quantification. phaseguides are invented that allow controlled spatial injection of gel, injection of sample and recovery of extracted rna. a precise sample volume can be defined by integrating electrophoretic actuation electrodes in the microfluidic chamber. electrolytic gas bubbles that are the result of constant-current actuation are driven out from the chip by the novel introduction of capillary bubble-expulsion techniques. the extraction approach and the functionality of the chip are demonstrated for escherichia coli and streptococcus thermophilus bacteria. linear extraction behavior is obtained for transfer-messenger rna down  to one colony-forming unit per microlitre, or five colony-forming units per chip. the latter is an increase in extraction efficiency of a factor of 1000 with respect to the commercial extraction kit ambion ribopure. the chip shows particularly good performance for extraction of low-molecular weight rna, thereby eliminating the need for large ribosomal rna and dna removal. rna can be extracted in less than 11 min, being a speed-up of more than a factor of 20 with  respect to commercial extraction kits. the presented solution may find broad acceptance and application in drug discovery and clinical diagnostics.

TI  == the cell envelope subtilisin-like proteinase is a virulence determinant for streptococcus suis.
AB  == background: streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen and zoonotic agent that  mainly causes septicemia, meningitis, and endocarditis. it has recently been suggested that proteinases produced by s. suis (serotype 2) are potential virulence determinants. in the present study, we screened a s. suis mutant library created by the insertion of tn917 transposon in order to isolate a mutant deficient in a cell surface proteinase. we characterized the gene and assessed the proteinase for its potential as a virulence factor. results: two mutants (g6g and m3g) possessing a single tn917 insertion were isolated. the affected gene coded for a protein (ssu0757) that shared a high degree of identity with streptococccus thermophilus prts (95.9%) and, to a lesser extent, with streptococcus agalactiae cspa (49.5%), which are cell surface serine proteinases. the ssu0757 protein had a calculated molecular mass of 169.6 kda and contained the catalytic triad characteristic of subtilisin family proteinases: motif i (asp200), motif ii (his239), and motif iii (ser568). ssu0757 also had the gram-positive cell wall anchoring motif (leu-pro-x-thr-gly) at the carboxy-terminus, which was followed by a hydrophobic domain. all the s. suis isolates tested, which belonged to different serotypes, possessed the gene encoding the ssu0757 protein. the two mutants devoid of subtilisin-like proteinase activity had longer generation times and were more susceptible to killing by whole blood than the wild-type parent strain p1/7. the virulence of the g6g and m3g mutants was compared to the wild-type strain in the cd1 mouse model. significant differences in mortality rates were noted between the p1/7 group and the m3g and g6g groups (p < 0.001). conclusion: in summary, we identified a gene coding for a cell surface subtilisin-like serine proteinase that is widely distributed in s. suis. evidences were brought for the involvement of this proteinase in s. suis virulence.

AB  == in the present study, the viability of heat-shocked and non-shocked cronobacter sakazakii, a foodborne pathogen, after drying and during the fermentation as well as storage of lactic cultured milk was evaluated. it was found that heat shock increased the viability of c. sakazakii. the pure culture of c. sakazakii, regardless of heat shock, grew rapidly in skim milk with a viable population of ca. 8.59-8.70 log cfu/ml after ca. 48 h of cultivation. thereafter, the viable population of c. sakazakii remained stable. while in the mix culture with streptococcus thermophilus or lactobacillus bulgaricus, a marked reduction in the viable population of c. sakazakii was noted after 24 h of cultivation in skim milk. nevertheless, at the end of fermentation, the heat-shocked c. sakazakii had a viable population of 5.93-6.01 log cfu/ml, which is significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of non-shocked cells of 4.96-4.99 log cfu/ml. while the presence  of c. sakazakii did not affect the growth of lactic acid bacteria in skim milk. additionally, heat shock was found to enhance the survival of c. sakazakii after  freeze-drying or spray-drying and during the storage of the lactic fermented milk products (ph 4.3) at 5 degrees c for 48 h.

AB  == aims: to develop a general method for site-directed mutagenesis in the dairy starter strain streptococcus thermophilus lmg 18311 which does not depend on antibiotic-resistance genes or other selection markers for the identification of  transformants. methods and results: in a previous study, we demonstrated that strep. thermophilus lmg 18311 can be made competent for natural genetic transformation by overexpression of the alternative sigma factor comx. in the present study, we wanted to investigate whether the natural transformation mechanism of strep. thermophilus lmg 18311 is efficient enough to make it feasible to perform site-directed mutagenesis in this strain without the use of a selection marker. competent bacteria were mixed with a dna fragment engineered to contain a nonsense and a frameshift mutation in the middle of the target gene (lacz) and subsequently seeded on agar plates. by performing colony-lift hybridization using a digoxigenin-labelled oligonucleotide probe, we succeeded in identifying transformants containing the sought after mutation. conclusions: by exploiting the natural transformability of strep. thermophilus lmg 18311 and standard molecular methods, we have demonstrated that the genome of this bacterium can be altered at preselected sites without introduction of any foreign dna. significance and impact of the study: a food-grade site-directed mutagenesis system has been developed for strep. thermophilus lmg 18311 that can be used by the dairy industry to construct starter strains with novel and/or improved properties.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus thermophilus lytic bacteriophages from mozzarella cheese plants.
AB  == phage infection still represents the main cause of fermentation failure during the mozzarella cheese manufacturing, where streptococcus thermophilus is widely employed as starter culture. thereby, the success of commercial lactic starter cultures is closely related to the use of strains with low susceptibility to phage attack. the characterization of lytic s. thermophilus bacteriophages is an  important step for the selection and use of starter cultures. the aim of this study was to characterize 26 bacteriophages isolated from mozzarella cheese plants in terms of their host range, dna restriction profile, dna packaging mechanism, and the variable region vr2 of the antireceptor gene. the dna restriction analysis was carried out by using the restriction enzymes ecorv, psti, and hindiii. the bacteriophages were distinguished into two main groups of  s. thermophilus phages (cos- and pac-type) using a multiplex pcr method based on  the amplification of conserved regions in the genes coding for the major structural proteins. all the phages belonged to the cos-type group except one, phage 1042, which gave a pcr fragment distinctive of pac-type group. furthermore, dna sequencing of the variable region vr2 of the antireceptor gene allowed to classify the phages and examine the correlation between typing profile and host range. finally, bacterial strains used in this study were investigated for the presence of temperate phages by induction with mitomycin c and only s. thermophilus chcc2070 was shown to be lysogenic.

TI  == antibacterial activity of some lactic acid bacteria isolated from an algerian dairy product.
AB  == in the present study, the antibacterial effect of 20 lactic acid bacteria isolates from a traditional cheese was investigated. 6 isolates showed antibacterial effect against gram positive bacteria. streptococcus thermophilus t2 strain showed the wide inhibitory spectrum against the gram positive bacteria. growth and bacteriocin production profiles showed that the maximal bacteriocin production, by s. thermophilus t2 cells, was measured by the end of the late-log  phase (90 au ml(-1)) with a bacteriocine production rate of 9.3 (au ml(-1)) h(-1). in addition, our findings showed that the bacteriocin, produced by s. thermophilus t2, was stable over a wide ph range (4-8); this indicates that such  bacteriocin may be useful in acidic as well as nonacidic food. this preliminarily work shows the potential application of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria to improve safety of traditional fermented food.

TI  == a novel pheromone quorum-sensing system controls the development of natural competence in streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == in streptococcal species, the key step of competence development is the transcriptional induction of comx, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigma(x), which positively regulates genes necessary for dna transformation. in streptococcus species belonging to the mitis and mutans groups, induction of comx relies on the activation of a three-component system consisting of a secreted pheromone, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator. in streptococcus thermophilus, a species belonging to the salivarius group, the oligopeptide transporter ami is essential for comx expression under competence-inducing conditions. this suggests a different regulation pathway of competence based on the production and reimportation of a signal peptide. the objective of our work was to identify the main actors involved in the early steps of comx induction in  s. thermophilus lmd-9. using a transcriptomic approach, four highly induced early competence operons were identified. among them, we found a rgg-like regulator (ster_0316) associated with a nonannotated gene encoding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (shp0316). through genetic deletions, we showed that these two genes are essential for comx induction. moreover, addition to the medium of synthetic peptides derived from the c-terminal part of shp0316 restored comx induction and transformation of a shp0316-deficient strain. these peptides also induced competence in s. thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius strains that are poorly transformable or not transformable. altogether, our results show that  ster_0316 and shp0316, renamed comrs, are the two members of a novel quorum-sensing system responsible for comx induction in species from the salivarius group, which differs from the classical phosphorelay three-component system identified previously in streptococci.

TI  == multistep mechanism of probiotic bacterium, the effect on innate immune system.
AB  == the etiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease are still not fully understood. however, evidence from both animal models and clinical observations suggests luminal bacteria as the most probable inducer of this disease. the intestinal bacterial microbiota may be modified by dietary addition of viable probiotic bacteria, thereby constituting an alternative approach to disease prevention and treatment. the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of two probiotic regiments; lactobacillus gg and a mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium lactis (yo-mix y 109 fro 1000) in both normal and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid colitis-induced rats. colon morphology and damage were evaluated histologically;  colonic tissues were used for mrna analysis, using real-time pcr. administration  of both probiotics reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and il-6 and increased the expression of mucin 2 in compared with colitis group and reduced the inflammatory response. these results  provide additional support for the positive effect of probiotics in the gut and may shed light on the mechanism by which probiotic bacteria exert their action in an animal model.

AB  == aims: to test whether a single vector, nisin-controlled expression (nice) system  could be used to regulate expression of the pediocin operon in streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and lactobacillus casei. methods and results: the intact pediocin operon was cloned immediately into pmsp3535 downstream of the nisa promoter (pnisa). the resulting vector, prsnped, was electrotransformed into strep. thermophilus st128, l. lactis subsp. lactis ml3 and lact. casei c2. presence of the intact vector was confirmed by pcr, resulting in the amplification of a 0.8-kb dna fragment, and inhibition zones were observed for all lactic acid bacteria (lab) transformants following induction with 50 ng ml(-1) nisin, when listeria monocytogenes scott a was used as the target bacterium. using l. monocytogenes nr30 as target, the l. lactis transformants produced hazy zones of inhibition, while the lact. casei transformants produced clear zones of inhibition. zones of inhibition were not observed when the strep.  thermophilus transformants were tested against nr30. conclusions: the lab hosts were able to produce enough pediocin to inhibit the growth of l. monocytogenes scott a; the growth of l. monocytogenes nr30 was effectively inhibited only by the lact. casei transformants. significance and impact of the study: this is the  first time that the nice system has been used to express the intact pediocin operon in these lab hosts. this system could allow for the in situ production of  pediocin in fermented dairy foods supplemented with nisin to prevent listeria contamination.

TI  == hydrolytic breakdown of lactoferricin by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactoferricin is a 25-amino acid antimicrobial peptide fragment that is liberated by pepsin digestion of lactoferrin present in bovine milk. along with its antibacterial properties, lactoferricin has also been reported to have immunostimulatory, antiviral, and anticarcinogenic effects. these attributes provide lactoferricin and other natural bioactive peptides with the potential to  be functional food ingredients that can be used by the food industry in a variety of applications. at present, commercial uses of these types of compounds are limited by the scarcity of information on their ability to survive food processing environments. we have monitored the degradation of lactoferricin during its incubation with two types of lactic acid bacteria used in the yogurt-making industry, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus, with the aim of assessing the stability of this milk protein-derived peptide under simulated yogurt-making conditions. analysis of the hydrolysis products isolated from these experiments indicates degradation of this peptide near neutral ph by lactic acid bacteria-associated peptidases, the extent of which was influenced by the bacterial strain used. however, the data also showed that compared to other milk-derived bioactive peptides that undergo complete degradation under these conditions, the 25-amino acid lactoferricin is apparently more resistant, with approximately 50% of the starting material remaining after 4 h of incubation. these findings imply that lactoferricin, as a  natural milk protein-derived peptide, has potential applications in the commercial production of yogurt-like fermented dairy products as a multi-functional food ingredient.

TI  == physicochemical, microbial, and sensory properties of yogurt supplemented with nanopowdered chitosan during storage.
AB  == this study was carried out to determine the possibility of adding nanopowdered chitosan (npc) into cholesterol-reduced yogurt to improve the functionality of yogurt and the effects of adding npc on the physicochemical, microbial, and sensory properties of the products during storage. the ph values and mean lactic  acid bacteria counts of npc-added (0.3 to approximately 0.7%, wt/vol) and cholesterol-reduced yogurt ranged from 4.19 to 4.41 and from 4.75 x 10(8) to 9.70 x 10(8) cfu/ml, respectively, when stored at 4 degrees c for 20 d, thereby indicating a possibility of prolonging the shelf life of yogurt. in color, the a* and b* values for cholesterol-reduced yogurt were not significantly influenced by the addition of npc (0.1 to approximately 0.7%, wt/vol); however, the l* values significantly decreased with the addition of the greatest concentration (0.7%, wt/vol) of npc at 0-d storage. the sensory test revealed that the astringency scores significantly increased at 0-d storage when the greatest concentration (0.7%, wt/vol) of npc was added into cholesterol-reduced yogurt. based on the data obtained from the current study, it is concluded that concentrations (0.3 to ~0.5%, vol/vol) of npc could be used to produce an npc-added and cholesterol-reduced yogurt without significantly adverse effects on the physicochemical, microbial, and sensory properties.

TI  == emergence of a cell wall protease in the streptococcus thermophilus population.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is perceived as a recently emerged food bacterium that evolved from a commensal ancestor by loss and gain of functions. here, we provide data allowing a better understanding of this evolutionary scheme. a multilocus sequence typing approach that we developed showed that s. thermophilus diverges significantly from its potential ancestors of the salivarius group and displays a low level of allelic variability, confirming its likely recent emergence. an analysis of the origin and dissemination of the prts gene was carried out within  this evolutionary scheme. this gene encodes a protease that allows better growth  in milk by facilitating casein breakdown to supply amino acids. the s. thermophilus protease exhibits 95% identity to the animal streptococcus suis protein prts. genomic analysis showed that prts is part of an island flanked by two tandem insertion sequence elements and containing three other genes which present the best identities and synteny with the s. suis genome. these data indicate a potential origin for this "ecological" island in a species closely related to s. suis. the analysis of the distribution of the prts gene in s. thermophilus showed that the gene is infrequent in historical collections but frequent in recent industrial ones. moreover, this "ecological" island conferring an important metabolic trait for milk adaptation appears to have disseminated by  lateral transfer in the s. thermophilus population. taken together, these data support an evolutionary scheme of s. thermophilus where gene acquisition and selection by food producers are determining factors. the source and impact of genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer on the physiology and safety of strains should be addressed.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == effect of probiotic supplementation on immunoglobulins, isoagglutinins and antibody response in children of low socio-economic status.
AB  == background: antigen exposure is one of the major exogenous factors modulating human immunocompetence acquisition. decline in family size and improvements in public health and hygiene in developed countries, may deprive the immune system of appropriate antigen input by diminishing infectious stimuli. probiotics are a  large group of microorganisms defined by their beneficial effects on human health and with stimulating effects on different functions of the immune system. aim of  the study: we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if  probiotics maintain their immune-stimulating effects in a population of 162 children with a high index of natural exposure to microorganisms. children were to ingest for at least 4 months one of two products, low-fat milk fermented by streptococcus thermophilus (control product) or low-fat milk fermented by s. thermophilus and lactobacillus casei, with lactobacillus acidophilus, oligofructose and inulin added after the fermentation process (test product). according to their age, children were vaccinated with dtp-hib vaccine or a 23-valent anti-pneumococcal vaccine. results: final analysis of results was done  in 70 children in each group, showing that the rate of immunoglobulin and isoagglutinin acquisition was similar in both groups. there was no difference between groups in antibody levels neither before nor after vaccination. days of fever and number of episodes of infection were not statistically different in either group. conclusions: supplementation of standard fermented milk with additional probiotics was not of benefit. the high natural rate of early microbial exposure in infants and children from a population of low socio-economic status living in a "less hygienic environment" may account for the absence of an additional immune-stimulating effect by supplementary probiotics.

TI  == diversity and evolution of the microbial populations during manufacture and ripening of casin, a traditional spanish, starter-free cheese made from cow's milk.
AB  == classical culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) techniques have been used for studying the microbial diversity and dynamics of the traditional spanish casin cheese during manufacturing and ripening. as with other starter-free cheeses made from raw milk, the microbial diversity of casin was shown to be high by both culturing and dgge analyses. the culture technique showed that lactic acid bacteria (lab) species constituted the majority of the microbial populations. of the 14 bacterial species identified, lactococcus garvieae was predominant in the three-day-old cheese sample, although it was replaced by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis at day 30. as expected, the dgge profiles obtained were complex, consisting, depending on the sample, in five to ten different amplification bands. among these, a band corresponding to streptococcus thermophilus was observed throughout the whole manufacturing process. this species had never been identified from traditional spanish cheeses  previously. culturing and molecular methods showed high populations of undesirable microorganisms, arguing for a required improvement in the hygiene of  casin manufacture. random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd) profiling suggested that the l. garvieae and l. lactis populations were composed of one and five strains, respectively. in addition, only a single l. lactis rapd pattern was stably maintained from day three to day 30, indicating high succession of strains along ripening. after a thoroughly characterisation, strains of the two lactococcus species could be used in designing specific starter cultures for casin. additional species (such as lactobacillus plantarum and corynebacterium variabile) might be included as adjunct cultures.

TI  == genome analysis of two virulent streptococcus thermophilus phages isolated in argentina.
AB  == two streptococcus thermophilus phages (alq13.2 and phiabc2) were previously isolated from breakdowns of cheese manufacture in argentina. complete nucleotide  sequence analysis indicated that both phages contained linear double-stranded dna: 35,525 bp in length for the pac-type phage alq13.2 and 34,882 bp for the cos-type phage phiabc2. forty-four and 48 open reading frames (orf) were identified for alq13.2 and phiabc2, respectively. comparative genomic analysis showed that these isolates shared many similarities with the eight previously studied cos- and pac-phages infecting different s. thermophilus strains. in particular, part of the phiabc2 genome was highly similar to a region of phage 7201, which was thought to be unique to this latter phage. protein analysis of the pac-phage alq13.2 using sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) identified three major proteins and seven minor proteins. parallel structural proteome analysis of phiabc2 revealed seven protein bands, two of which were related to major structural proteins, as expected for a cos-type phage. similarities to other s. thermophilus phages suggest that the streptococcal phage diversity is not extensive in worldwide dairy factories possibly because related  high-performing bacterial strains are used in starter cultures.

AB  == bitto of valchiavenna, an artisanal italian cheese produced without the addition  of any starter cultures, has been attributed a protected designation origin (pdo) cheese, but the strain composition of the natural microbial population colonizing this traditional dairy product is still unknown. to obtain preliminary information on the non starter lactic acid bacteria involved in its ripening, a total of 136 nslab isolates, randomly selected from mrs and m17 agar plates, were collected from three different cheese samples after 120 days of ripening. the new isolates were identified by combining pcr 16s-23s rdna spacer analyses, partial 16s rrna gene sequencing, species-specific probes and colony hybridization. eighty-two isolates, representing 60% of the total strains selected, were homofermentative cocci: 83% of them were enterococci, with enterococcus durans being the predominant species found. pediococcus spp. were also isolated, together with strains of streptococcus thermophilus. within lactobacilli, 57% of  the isolates were identified as lactobacillus paracasei; lact. curvatus, lact. plantarum, lact. fermentum, were present in a lower amount. the isolates were differentiated at strain-level by rep-pcr analysis. this is the first effort to microbiological characterization of valchiavenna's bitto; the results suggest the possibility of preserving the wild bacterial population in order to protect the typical organoleptic characteristics of this traditional raw milk cheese and to select new strains for the dairy industry.

AB  == aims: an efficient approach for generation of bacteriophage-insensitive mutants (bims) of streptococcus thermophilus starters was described in our laboratory [mills et al. (2007) j microbiol methods70, 159-164]. the aim of this study was to analyse the phage resistance mechanism responsible for bim formation. methods  and results: three clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (crispr) regions have been identified in strep. thermophilus, and strep. thermophilus can integrate novel spacers into these loci in response to phage attack. characterization of three sets of bims indicated that two sets had altered crispr1 and/or crispr3 loci. a range of bims of yoghurt starter csk938 were generated with the same phage in different phage challenge experiments, and  each acquired unique spacer regions ranging between one and four new spacers in crispr1. in addition, the bim that acquired only one new spacer in crispr1 also acquired an additional spacer in crispr3. a fourth bim, generated with a different phage, had two spacers deleted from crispr1 but acquired two spacers in crispr3. analysis of the mozzarella starter csk939 and its associated bims indicated that formation of second generation bims does not lead to increases in  spacer number but to alterations in spacer regions. bims of an exopolysaccharide  (eps)-producing strain that lost the ability to produce eps did not harbour an altered crispr, suggesting that phage sensitivity may be related to the eps-producing phenotype. conclusions: acquisition/deletion of new spacers in crispr loci in response to phage attack generates distinctly individual variants. it also demonstrates that other modifications may be responsible for the phage resistance of strep. thermophilus bims. significance and impact of the study: isolation of individual bims that have unique spacers towards the leader region of the crispr locus may be a very useful approach for rotation strategies with the same starter backbone. upon phage infection, bims 'in reserve' can be slotted into the rotation scheme.

AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == a method for manufacturing superior set yogurt under reduced oxygen conditions.
AB  == the yogurt starters lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus are well-known facultatively anaerobic bacteria that can grow in oxygenated environments. we found that they removed dissolved oxygen (do) in a yogurt mix as the fermentation progressed and that they began to produce acid actively after the do concentration in the yogurt mix was reduced to 0 mg/kg, suggesting that the do retarded the production of acid. yogurt fermentation was carried out at 43 or 37 degrees c both after the do reduction treatment and without prior treatment. nitrogen gas was mixed and dispersed into the yogurt mix after inoculation with yogurt starter culture to reduce the do concentration in the yogurt mix. the treatment that reduced do concentration in the yogurt mix to  approximately 0 mg/kg beforehand caused the starter culture lb81 used in this study to enter into the exponential growth phase earlier. furthermore, the combination of reduced do concentration in the yogurt mix beforehand and incubation at a lower temperature (37 degrees c) resulted in a superior set yogurt with a smooth texture and strong curd structure.

TI  == enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI  == dynamics of fecal microbiota in hospitalized elderly fed probiotic lkm512 yogurt.
AB  == the comprehensive dynamics of intestinal microbiota including uncultured bacteria in response to probiotic consumption have not been well studied. the aims of this study were twofold: firstly to analyze the impact on intestinal microbiota of yogurt fermented by bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis lkm512, lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lkm1759, and streptococcus thermophilus lkm1742 (lkm512 yogurt) and placebo fermented by these lactic acid bacterial strains without lkm512; and secondly to investigate the changes in intestinal microbiota  that influence the concentration of pa, one of the beneficial metabolites produced by bacteria in the intestine. the lkm512 yogurt/placebo trial was performed in six hospitalized elderly patients (three men and three women with an average age of 80.3 years) and lasted seven weeks with the following schedule: pre-consumption for one week, lkm512 yogurt consumption for two weeks, washout period for two weeks, and placebo consumption for two weeks. the amount of ingested lkm512 yogurt or placebo was 100 g/day/individual. fecal samples were analyzed using t-rflp and real-time pcr. the t-rflp patterns in five of the six volunteers were changed in a similar fashion by lkm512 yogurt consumption, although these patterns were individually changed following consumption of placebo. it was confirmed that b. animalis subsp. lactis was increased dramatically and lactobacillus spp. tended to be decreased by lkm512 yogurt consumption. some indigenous uncultured bacteria were increased and some decreased by lkm512 yogurt/placebo consumption. the similar changes in the intestinal microbiota of the elderly caused by consumption of the lkm512 yogurt were found to be influenced by the lkm512 strain itself, and not by the lactic acid bacteria in the yogurt. moreover, this study suggests that the increase in intestinal pa concentrations caused by lkm512 yogurt consumption is probably dependent on the lkm512 strain colonizing the intestine.

TI  == application of aflp fingerprint analysis for studying the biodiversity of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacteria (lab) widely used in milk fermentation processes as a starter culture. in this work the genetic diversity of s. thermophilus isolates from different sources was analyzed using amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting (aflp). since this is the first report that indicates the application of aflp in order to study genotypic polymorphism in s. thermophilus species, an optimization of experimental conditions was carried out to decide the optimal aflp analysis protocol. furthermore the fingerprinting resolutions of aflp and rapd (random amplified polymorphic dna) were evaluated and compared. the overall data suggest that genotypic characterization performed by aflp provide a better view of microbial diversity of s. thermophilus, indicating that rapd is less discriminating than aflp. the successful use of aflp analysis in the characterization of s. thermophilus strains reported in this study suggests the potential uses for this  technique to define the whole-genome diversity of each specific strain, as an alternative to the fingerprinting methods used till now.

TI  == balancing inflammatory, lipid, and xenobiotic signaling pathways by vsl#3, a biotherapeutic agent, in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == background: the interleukin 10 knockout mouse (il10-ko) is a model of human inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) used to study host microbial interactions and the action of potential therapeutics. using affymetrix data analysis, important signaling pathways and transcription factors relevant to gut inflammation and antiinflammatory probiotics were identified. methods: affymetrix microarray analysis on both wildtype (wt) and il10-ko mice orally administered with and without the probiotic vsl#3 was performed and the results validated by real-time  polymerase chain reaction (pcr), immunocytochemistry, proteomics, and histopathology. changes in metabolically active bacteria were assessed with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). results: inflammation in il10-ko  mice was characterized by differential regulation of inflammatory, nuclear receptor, lipid, and xenobiotic signaling pathways. probiotic intervention resulted in downregulation of cxcl9 (fold change [fc] = -3.98, false discovery rate [fdr] = 0.019), cxcl10 (fc = -4.83, fdr = 0.0008), ccl5 (fc = -3.47, fdr = 0.017), t-cell activation (itgal [fc = -4.72, fdr = 0.00009], itgae [fc = -2.54 fdr = 0.0044]) and the autophagy gene irgm (fc = -1.94, fdr = 0.01), a recently identified susceptibility gene in human ibd. consistent with a marked reduction in integrins, probiotic treatment decreased the number of ccl5+ cd3+ double-positive t cells and upregulated galectin2, which triggers apoptosis of activated t cells. importantly, genes associated with lipid and ppar signaling (pparalpha [fc = 2.36, fdr = 0.043], ppargc1alpha [fc = 2.58, fdr = 0.016], nr1d2 [fc = 3.11, fdr = 0.0067]) were also upregulated. altered microbial diversity was noted in probiotic-treated mice. conclusions: bioinformatics analysis revealed important immune response, phagocytic and inflammatory pathways dominated by elevation of t-helper cell 1 type (th1) transcription factors in il10-ko mice. probiotic intervention resulted in a site-specific reduction of these pathways but importantly upregulated ppar, xenobiotic, and lipid signaling genes, potential antagonists of nf-kappab inflammatory pathways.

TI  == improvement of constipation and liver function by plant-derived lactic acid bacteria: a double-blind, randomized trial.
AB  == objective: lactic acid bacteria (lab) contribute to human health; however, the probiotic properties vary among strains classified into the same species. the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of yogurts made by different types of lab on the gastrointestinal system. the yogurts were also evaluated by measuring serum lipid contents and liver functional indicators as a  secondary objective. methods: healthy human adults (n = 68) with some complaints  with regard to intestinal health, including constipation and diarrhea, were randomly assigned to receive one of three types of yogurt in a double-blind manner: type a, a yogurt made by plant-derived lab (mainly lactobacillus [lb.] plantarum sn35n); type b, a yogurt made by plant-derived lab (mainly lb. plantarum sn13t); and type c, a yogurt made by animal-derived lab (mainly lactococcus lactis a6 and streptococcus thermophilus 510) as a control. the subjects consumed 100 g of yogurt daily for 6 wk. data were collected from clinical visits at 2-wk intervals and by diaries used to record defecation and health conditions. results: drastic and constant increments of defecation frequency in subjects with constipation were observed with type a and b yogurts but not with type c yogurt. type b and c yogurts resulted in decreases in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. the serum concentrations of liver functional parameters were improved by the type b yogurt (12-25% reduction). conclusion: the present study suggests that lb. plantarum sn13t exhibits a superior probiotic effect on constipation in addition to improving the serum lipid contents and liver function.

TI  == degradation of milk-based bioactive peptides by yogurt fermentation bacteria.
AB  == aims: to analyse the effect of cell-associated peptidases in yogurt starter culture strains lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (lb) and streptococcus  thermophilus (st) on milk-protein-based antimicrobial and hypotensive peptides in order to determine their survival in yogurt-type dairy foods. methods and results: the 11mer antimicrobial and 12mer hypotensive milk-protein-derived peptides were incubated with mid-log cells of lb and st, which are required for yogurt production. incubations were performed at ph 4.5 and 7.0, and samples removed at various time points were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc). the peptides remained mostly intact at ph 4.5 in the presence of st strains and moderately digested by exposure to lb cells. peptide loss occurred more rapidly and was more extensive after incubation at ph  7.0. conclusions: the 11mer and 12mer bioactive peptides may be added at the end  of the yogurt-making process when the ph level has dropped to 4.5, limiting the overall extent of proteolysis. significance and impact of the study: the results  show the feasibility of using milk-protein-based antimicrobial and hypotensive peptides as food supplements to improve the health-promoting qualities of liquid  and semi-solid dairy foods prepared by the yogurt fermentation process.

TI  == the role of aminopeptidase peps in the growth of streptococcus thermophilus is not restricted to nitrogen nutrition.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effect of an absence of aminopeptidase peps on the growth of streptococcus thermophilus on different media and at different temperatures. methods and results: using gene interruption, a negative mutant of  the strep. thermophilus cnrz385 strain was constructed for the aminopeptidase peps (strain deltapeps). checks were first of all made using biochemical assays that the deltapeps strain lacks the peptide hydrolase activity of aminopeptidase  peps. it was demonstrated that the absence of the aminopeptidase peps exerted a negative effect on growth whatever the culture medium (m17, chemically defined medium, milk). the role of aminopeptidase peps in growth was enhanced at a high temperature (45 degrees c vs 37 degrees c). the deltapeps strain was more resistant to lysozyme than the wild-type strain. conclusions: we were able to demonstrate that aminopeptidase peps probably plays a pleiotropic role through its involvement in growth via nitrogen nutrition, as well as via other cellular functions/metabolisms (such as peptidoglycane metabolism). significance and impact of the study: this study constitutes the first report on the role of a member of the m29 merops family of metallopeptidases (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/).

AB  == possible promoter regions preceding 14 genes belonging to the proteolytic system  of streptococcus thermophilus klds 3.0503 were predicted by a promoter analysis software nnpp. the 14 genes included an extracellular protease gene prts, an oligopeptide abc transport system gene amia1, and 12 genes, respectively, encoding peptidases pepa, peps, pepn, pepc, pepb, pepq, pepv, pept, pepm, pepxp,  pepp, and pepo. these predicted promoter sequences were cloned and inserted into  the upstream of a promoterless escherichia coli gusa (beta-glucuronidase) gene in a promoter probe vector pnz273. the resulting vectors were, respectively, introduced into s. thermophilus klds 3.0503 and all 14 predicted promoter sequences were able to drive gusa expression, which indicated that these sequences were functional promoters. these promoters were able to interact with the s. thermophilus cody homolog in an in vitro dna binding assay but they did not contain a conserved cody-box sequence identified in lactococcus lactis. these results were useful for further studies on the regulation of protein metabolism in s. thermophilus.

TI  == prevention of tnbs-induced colitis by different lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains is associated with an expansion of gammadeltat and regulatory t cells of  intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.
AB  == background: probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (lpls) function. data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (iels). the aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both iels and lpls. methods: balb/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as mix1 (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum), or mix2 (lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). colitis  was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs). probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). colon subpopulations of iels and lpls were assayed by flow cytometry. serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (cba). results: all probiotics colonized the intestine. the 2 mixtures prevented the tnbs-induced intestinal damage, and mix1 was the most effective. the mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in cd4(+) cells of iels and lpls, an increase in gammadeltat cells of iels, and a decrease in gammadeltat cells of lpls. an expansion of t regulatory (treg) cells of iels was induced by mix1 and mix2. both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (il)-10. in addition, mix1 prevented the tnbs-induced increase of il-12 and interferon (ifn)-gamma. conclusions: the 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the tnbs-induced colitis; the l. acidophilus and b. longum mixture was the most effective. other than an involvement of lpls, our results report a novel importance of the iels population in probiotic protection.

AB  == in this study, soy protein isolate (spi) (4%, v/w) was supplemented to the yogurt mix to increase the amount of biologically active isoflavone in yogurt (sy). the  control yogurt was without any spi supplementation (usy). the supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) increased the lactose metabolism by the yogurt starter including lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 (lb 11842) and streptococcus thermophilus st 1342 (st 1342) during the fermentation process by 4.7%. the starter produced more acetic acid and less lactic acid in sy than that  in usy and altered the ratio of lactic and acetic acid during the entire storage  period. the viability of both lb 11842 and st 1342 in sy was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that in usy from 14 d of the storage period, however, their concentration still remained high (8.11 to 8.84 log cfu/g). the starter transformed 72.8% of total inactive isoflavone glycosides (ig) to active isoflavone aglycones (ia), increasing the ia content from 1.35 to 15.01 mg/100 g  sample. during the storage period, ia concentration slowly rose from 15.02 to 15.51 mg/100 g sample.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used in food industry and their growth performance is important for the quality of the fermented product. by combining results from conventional isolation methods and molecular investigation of 16s rrna gene and lactococcal/enterococcal specific genes, we identify at species level catalase negative gram positive thermoresistant cocci isolated from traditional 'leben', a 24-h fermented milk in arid area of west algeria. forty strains phenotypically related to cocci lab were identified as belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and other enterococcus species. no streptococcus thermophilus strain was isolated. ten different phenotype groups were recognized, and the species content of these groups were in some cases different from the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. in particular, atypical lactococci, able to grow in 6.5% nacl, at ph 9.5 and showing high resistance to thermal stresses were isolated. lactococci, but also enterococci isolated from traditional 'leben' produced in the desert area, may be therefore of interest in milk fermentation. further studies to assess this source of diversity within the wild microbial population should provide starter new strains for product innovation.

TI  == identification and characterization of a strain-dependent cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase in lactobacillus casei potentially involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  == the trans-sulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of cysteine and methionine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine and homocysteine. the genome database of lactobacillus casei atcc 334 provides evidence that this species cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. however, several l. casei strains use methionine as the sole sulfur source, which implies that these strains can convert methionine to cysteine. cystathionine synthases and lyases play a crucial role in the trans-sulfuration pathway. by applying proteomic techniques, we have identified a protein in cell-free extracts of l. casei, which showed high homology to a gene product encoded in the genome of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus but not in the genome of l. casei atcc  334. the presence of the gene was only found in strains able to grow on methionine as the sole sulfur source. moreover, two gene variants were identified. both gene variants were cloned and expressed heterologously in escherichia coli. the recombinant enzymes exhibited cystathionine lyase activity  in vitro and also cleaved cysteine, homocysteine and methionine releasing volatile sulfur compounds.

TI  == effect of exopolysaccharides on the hydrolysis of beta-lactoglobulin by lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636 in an in vitro gastric/pancreatic system.
AB  == an analysis of the peptides generated by hydrolysis of blg by nonproliferating cells of the strain lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636 was carried out. the effect of polysaccharides (pectin, and two eps synthesized by two streptococcus thermophilus strains, eps1190 and eps804) on blg digestibility using an in vitro  gastric/pancreatic system was analyzed. polysaccharides are commonly used in the  dairy industry to improve food texture; these hydrocolloids may interact with proteins, affecting their digestibility. nonproliferating cells of lb. acidophilus crl 636 were able to hydrolyze 52% of blg. twenty-six resulting peptides with molecular masses in the range 544-4119 da were identified by lc-ms/ms. these peptides resulted mostly from the hydrolysis of the more accessible n-terminal part of blg. degradation of blg by pepsin was poor (8%). when blg was previously hydrolyzed by lb. acidophilus crl 636, peptic hydrolysis  was of 54.8%, while when pectin and eps1190 were added, hydrolysis was higher (58.2 and 57.2%, respectively). peptides crossing 8 kda dialysis membranes after  trypsin/chymotrypsin hydrolysis were analyzed by hpsec. the produced peptides were smaller when blg was hydrolyzed previously by the lb. acidophilus strain. moreover, in the presence of pectin, the amount of the larger peptide (3.5 kda) observed in the size exclusion chromatograms was considerably decreased. our studies showed that prehydrolysis of blg by lb. acidophilus crl 636 had a positive influence on blg digestibility and that polysaccharides may change the peptide profile yielded by trypsin/chymotrypsin hydrolysis, releasing smaller size peptides, which are known to be less immune-reactive. moreover, lb. acidophilus crl 636 was able to hydrolyze the main epitopes (41-60, 102-124, and  149-162) of blg, reducing its allergenic content.

TI  == analysis of crispr system function in plant pathogen xanthomonas oryzae.
AB  == clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (crispr) is a bacterial  immunity system that requires a perfect sequence match between the crispr cassette spacer and a protospacer in invading dna for exclusion of foreign genetic elements. crispr cassettes are hypervariable, possibly reflecting different exposure of strains of the same species to foreign genetic elements. here, we determined crispr cassette sequences of two xanthomonas oryzae strains and found that one of the strains remains sensitive to phage xop411 despite carrying a cassette that has a spacer exactly matching a fragment of the xop411 genome. to explain this apparent paradox, we identified x. oryzae crispr spacers  of likely phage origin and defined a consensus sequence of a motif adjacent to x. oryzae phage protospacers. our analysis revealed that the xop411 protospacer that matches the crispr spacer has this motif mutated, which likely explains the phage's ability to infect its host. while similar observations were made previously with streptococcus thermophilus and its phages, the conserved motif in x. oryzae phages is located on a protospacer side opposite to the s. thermophilus phages' motif. the results thus point to a considerable degree of variety of crispr-mediated phage resistance mechanisms in different bacteria.

AB  == acetyl-salicylic acid (asa) is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory/analgesic drug, which may cause gastritis or stomach ulcers if intensively employed. exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing lactic acid bacteria have been claimed to induce immunostimulatory/antiulcer effects in the host. this study investigated the potential preventive effect of fermented milks (fm) with eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strains (crl 1190 and crl 804) on an in vivo model of  chronic gastritis. fermented milks (2 eps(+) and 1 eps(-), separately) were fed to balb/c mice for 7 d before inducing gastritis with asa (400 mg/kg of body weight per day for 10 d; gastritis group, n = 5). appropriate control groups (asa administered but not given fm, n = 5; and asa not administered but given fm) were included in this study. gastric inflammatory activity was evaluated through the stomach's histology and the number of ifngamma(+) and il-10(+) cytokine-producing cells in the gastric mucosa. only mice preventively treated with the eps-producing strep. thermophilus crl 1190 fm and later administered asa did not  develop gastritis, showing a conserved gastric mucosa structure similar to those  of healthy mice. a marked decrease of ifngamma(+)- and increase of il-10(+)-producing cells compared with the gastritis group mice were observed. purified eps from strep. thermophilus crl 1190 resuspended in autoclaved milk was also effective for gastritis prevention. the eps-protein interaction might be responsible for the observed gastroprotective effect; such interactions may be affected by industrial manufacturing conditions. the results indicate that the fm with strep. thermophilus crl 1190 or its eps could be used in novel functional foods for preventing chronic gastritis.

TI  == the oligopeptide transport system is essential for the development of natural competence in streptococcus thermophilus strain lmd-9.
AB  == in gram-positive bacteria, oligopeptide transport systems, called opp or ami, play a role in nutrition but are also involved in the internalization of signaling peptides that take part in the functioning of quorum-sensing pathways.  our objective was to reveal functions that are controlled by ami via quorum-sensing mechanisms in streptococcus thermophilus, a nonpathogenic bacterium widely used in dairy technology in association with other bacteria. using a label-free proteomic approach combining one-dimensional electrophoresis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we compared the proteome of the s. thermophilus lmd-9 to that of a mutant deleted for the subunits c, d, and e of the ami operon. both strains were grown in a chemically defined medium (cdm) without peptides. we focused our attention on proteins that  were no more detected in the ami deletion mutant. in addition to the three subunits of the ami transporter, 17 proteins fulfilled this criterion and, among  them, 7 were similar to proteins that have been identified as essential for transformation in s. pneumoniae. these results led us to find a condition of growth, the early exponential state in cdm, that allows natural transformation in s. thermophilus lmd-9 to turn on spontaneously. cells were not competent in m17 rich medium. furthermore, we demonstrated that the ami transporter controls the triggering of the competence state through the control of the transcription of comx, itself controlling the transcription of late competence genes. we also showed that one of the two oligopeptide-binding proteins of strain lmd-9 plays the predominant role in the control of competence.

TI  == genome analysis of food grade lactic acid-producing bacteria: from basics to applications.
AB  == whole-genome sequencing has revolutionized and accelerated scientific research that aims to study the genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology of bacteria.  lactic acid-producing bacteria, which include lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria, are typically gram-positive, catalase-negative organisms, which occupy a wide range of natural plant- and animal-associated environments. lab species are frequently involved in the transformation of perishable raw materials into more stable, pleasant, palatable and safe fermented food products. lab and bifidobacteria are also found among the resident microbiota of the gastrointestinal and/or genitourinary tracts of vertebrates, where they are believed to exert health-promoting effects. at present, the genomes of more than  20 lab and bifidobacterial species have been completely sequenced. their genome content reflects its specific metabolism, physiology, biosynthetic capabilities,  and adaptability to varying conditions and environments. the typical lab/bifidobacterial genome is relatively small (from 1.7 to 3.3 mb) and thus harbors a limited assortment of genes (from around 1,600 to over 3,000). these small genomes code for a broad array of transporters for efficient carbon and nitrogen assimilation from the nutritionally-rich niches they usually inhabit, and specify a rather limited range of biosynthetic and degrading capabilities. the variation in the number of genes suggests that the genome evolution of each of these bacterial groups involved the processes of extensive gene loss from their particular ancestor, diversification of certain common biological activities through gene duplication, and acquisition of key functions via horizontal gene transfer. the availability of genome sequences is expected to revolutionize the exploitation of the metabolic potential of lab and bifidobacteria, improving their use in bioprocessing and their utilization in biotechnological and health-related applications.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 increases lactacin b production when it senses live target bacteria.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 is a probiotic strain used in dairy products. production of bacteriocin by l. acidophilus la-5 was achieved when it was grown in co-cultures with the yogurt starter species streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. however, bacteriocin induction was not observed when heat-killed cells were used as inducers. this study demonstrates that l. acidophilus la-5 produces lactacin b and that the bacteriocin expression is controlled by an auto-induction mechanism involving the secreted peptide ip_1800. the transcript level of the lactacin b gene cluster expression was investigated in co-cultures between l. acidophilus la-5 and s. thermophilus sty-31 and a remarkable increase of the bacteriocin structural gene  (lbab) transcription was observed. however, lbab was transcribed constitutively in uninduced l. acidophilus la-5 cells, but the levels of the secreted bacteriocin were not enough to be detected by the agar diffusion assay. a new method for bacteriocin detection was formulated based on the monitoring on real time of lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei growth in presence of the supernatant and the cell wall extracts of pure and induced l. acidophilus la-5. these results showed that part of lactacin b secreted remains adhered to cell envelope.

TI  == in silico prediction of horizontal gene transfer events in lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus reveals protocooperation in yogurt manufacturing.
AB  == lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, used in yogurt starter cultures, are well known for their stability and protocooperation during their coexistence in milk. in this study, we show that a close interaction between the  two species also takes place at the genetic level. we performed an in silico analysis, combining gene composition and gene transfer mechanism-associated features, and predicted horizontally transferred genes in both l. bulgaricus and  s. thermophilus. putative horizontal gene transfer (hgt) events that have occurred between the two bacterial species include the transfer of exopolysaccharide (eps) biosynthesis genes, transferred from s. thermophilus to l. bulgaricus, and the gene cluster cbs-cblb(cglb)-cyse for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, transferred from l. bulgaricus or lactobacillus helveticus to s. thermophilus. the hgt event for the cbs-cblb(cglb)-cyse gene cluster was analyzed in detail, with respect to both evolutionary and functional  aspects. it can be concluded that during the coexistence of both yogurt starter species in a milk environment, agonistic coevolution at the genetic level has probably been involved in the optimization of their combined growth and interactions.

TI  == production of fresh cheddar cheese curds with controlled postacidification and enhanced flavor.
AB  == cheddar cheese in curd form is very popular in eastern canada. it is retailed immediately after cheese manufacturing and can be maintained at room temperature  for 24 h to provide better texture and mouthfeel. subsequently, the cheese curds  must be stored at 4 degrees c. the shelf life is generally 3 d. in this study, cheddar cheese curds were produced by adding a high diacetyl flavor-producing strain (lactococcus diacetylactis) to a thermophilic-based starter. the objective was to achieve both postacidification stability to increase the shelf life and enhanced flavor. the addition of l. diacetylactis increased processing time but did not affect cheese composition or the evolution of proteolysis and texture. during cheese manufacturing, streptococci became the dominant microflora in all cheeses, whereas populations of lactococcus cremoris and l. diacetylactis decreased. during cheese storage, viable counts of l. diacetylactis and streptococcus thermophilus increased but the counts of l. cremoris decreased. during cheese manufacturing and storage, the concentrations of lactic acid and diacetyl increased rapidly in cheeses produced with l. diacetylactis. citric acid and galactose contents remained high in cheese made without l. diacetylactis. sensory evaluation indicated that cheeses containing the l. diacetylactis strain  were more flavorful and also had less sourness and could be stored at 4 degrees c for up to 7 d.

TI  == the relevance of carbon dioxide metabolism in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is a major component of dairy starter cultures used for the manufacture of yoghurt and cheese. in this study, the co(2) metabolism of s. thermophilus dsm 20617(t), grown in either a n(2) atmosphere or an enriched co(2) atmosphere, was analysed using both genetic and proteomic approaches. growth experiments performed in a chemically defined medium revealed that co(2) depletion resulted in bacterial arginine, aspartate and uracil auxotrophy. moreover, co(2) depletion governed a significant change in cell morphology, and a high reduction in biomass production. a comparative proteomic analysis revealed that cells of s. thermophilus showed a different degree of energy status depending on the co(2) availability. in agreement with proteomic data, cells grown under n(2) showed a significantly higher milk acidification rate compared with those grown in an enriched co(2) atmosphere. experiments carried out on s. thermophilus wild-type and its derivative mutant, which was inactivated in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and carbamoyl-phosphate synthase activities responsible for fixing co(2) to organic molecules, suggested that the anaplerotic reactions governed by these enzymes have a central role in bacterial metabolism.  our results reveal the capnophilic nature of this micro-organism, underlining the essential role of co(2) in s. thermophilus physiology, and suggesting potential applications in dairy fermentation processes.

AB  == we applied two methods of broth microdilution and etest for measuring minimal inhibition concentration (mic) of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for 15  antimicrobial agents to compare the feasibility, reproducibility, and equivalence of the two methods. both methods were originally described by the european projects prosafe and ace-art. in 84% combinations of strains and antimicrobial agents mic differences between the two methods were within one log(2) dilution. in the case of rifampicin the difference between the two methods was more than ten-fold. we further determined mics of 70 strains (14 strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 16 strains of lactococcus lactis, 30 strains of streptococcus thermophilus, and 10 strains of bifidobacterium longum) by the broth microdilution method. in most cases, mic distributions were uni-modal and within 5 log(2) dilutions except for the mic distribution of l. lactis to the aminoglycoside group which was broader. these data are a good basis for improving knowledge of antimicrobial susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, and can be used to revise tentative epidemiological cut-off values.

TI  == tina wooden vat biofilm: a safe and highly efficient lactic acid bacteria delivering system in pdo ragusano cheese making.
AB  == in the sicilian pdo ragusano cheese making, raw milk is placed in a wooden vat called a tina. as no starter is added, lactic acid is produced by milk flora and  flora released from the tina biofilm. the aim of this work was to assess the safety and efficiency of this natural inoculation system. from 15 tinas' biofilms, bacteria total counts varied from 10(3) to 10(6) cfu/cm(2), with the predominance of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria. low counts of yeasts and moulds were found in a few tinas. salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7 were totally absent, as assessed by conventional plating and the bax detection system after enrichment, highlighting the safety of the system. from four tinas out of the 15, micropieces of wood were observed by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. the biofilm entrapped in a matrix covered almost entirely the surface of the wood. polysaccharides were detected in the four tinas. in three of the latter, cocci were predominant in the ecosystem whereas in the other one, cocci, bacilli, yeasts and moulds were observed. fifty litres of microfiltrated milk (<10 cfu/ml) were poured in the four tinas for 10 min of contact. enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and enterococci were performed in the milk after contact. depending on the tina, from 5.10(4) to 10(6) cfu/ml of streptococcus thermophilus were released into the milk, and from 10(4)  to 10(5) cfu/ml of thermophilic lactobacilli. spontaneous acidification after contact confirmed the high efficiency of biofilm lactic acid bacteria delivery.

AB  == williopsis saturnus var. saturnus is a known killer toxin-producing yeast. the effects of this yeast as a biopreservative against spoilage yeasts (galactose fermenting) were investigated in cheeses made under laboratory conditions. at an  inoculation level of approximately 10(6) cfu/g of cheese, this killer yeast inhibited growth of lactose non-fermenting but galactose-fermenting yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae vl1 inoculated at approximately 10(3) cfu/g; it also inhibited growth of lactose-fermenting and galactose-fermenting yeast kluvyveromyces marxianus atcc8640 inoculated at approximately 10(3)-10(4) cfu/g in the cheeses manufactured with galactose-producing starter culture streptococcus thermophilus. in contrast, the two spoilage yeasts grew to approximately 10(6) cfu/g from the initial cell count of approximately 10(3) cfu/g without the killer yeast. this study indicated that w. saturnus var. saturnus could be an effective biopreservative for cheese spoilage control.

TI  == short motif sequences determine the targets of the prokaryotic crispr defence system.
AB  == clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr) and their associated crispr-associated sequence (cas) proteins constitute a novel antiviral defence system that is widespread in prokaryotes. repeats are separated by spacers, some of them homologous to sequences in mobile genetic elements. although the whole process involved remains uncharacterized, it is known that new spacers are incorporated into crispr loci of the host during a phage challenge, conferring specific resistance against the virus. moreover, it has been demonstrated that such interference is based on small rnas carrying a spacer. these rnas would guide the defence apparatus to foreign molecules carrying sequences that match the spacers. despite this essential role, the spacer uptake  mechanism has not been addressed. a first step forward came from the detection of motifs associated with spacer precursors (proto-spacers) of streptococcus thermophilus, revealing a specific recognition of donor sequences in this species. here we show that the conservation of proto-spacer adjacent motifs (pams) is a common theme for the most diverse crispr systems. the pam sequence depends on the crispr-cas variant, implying that there is a crispr-type-specific  (motif-directed) choice of the spacers, which subsequently determines the interference target. pams also direct the orientation of spacers in the repeat arrays. remarkably, observations based on such polarity argue against a recognition of the spacer precursors on transcript rna molecules as a general rule.

AB  == the bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. total microbial dna was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template  in polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to study the hypervariable v3 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). representative bands of dgge patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. the use of universal primer for pcr-dgge allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also  for other adventitious species. dgge profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. cluster analysis of dgge profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. some lactic acid bacteria (lab) recurred in many  samples (streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. the microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant lab but also adventitious bacteria (macrococcus caseolyticus, rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (chryseobacterium spp., pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees c of coagulated milk. pantoea spp. was primarily  found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of e. faecium, e. faecalis and s. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. these species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.

TI  == streptococcus thermophilus produces exopolysaccharides including hyaluronic acid.
AB  == hyaluronic acid (ha) is an important material for medical, cosmetic and food applications. ha is obtained commercially from rooster combs and the fermentation of streptococci. however, the safety problems such as hyaluronidase or exotoxin contamination remain controversial. to reduce the risk of hyaluronidase or exotoxin contamination, we attempted to isolate strains of streptococcus thermophilus with high productivity of useful exopolysaccharides (epss) including ha from traditional dairy food products. forty-six s. thermophilus strains were isolated from dairy food products, and examined of their ha production using a ha binding protein method. according to the results, six s. thermophilus strains produced epss including ha. s. thermophilus yit 2084 had a markedly high ha productivity (approximately 8 mg/l). we focused on the high-molecular-mass fraction of eps (2000 kda) from s. thermophilus yit 2084. by using high-performance liquid chromatography, it was found that a high-molecular-mass fraction of eps included n-acetylglucosamine (54.4%) and glucuronic acid (45.6%), which are components of ha. furthermore, 13c-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that the spectra of the high-molecular-mass fraction corresponded well to those of commercial ha. here, we described for the first time that s. thermophilus, which is a generally recognized safe bacterium, produces ha. the novel ha-producing bacterium s thermophilus yit 2084 has great potential for applications in the medical, cosmetic and food fields, although its culture conditions remain to be improved.

AB  == aims: to identify the chemical structure of a bacteriocin, thermophilin 1277, produced by streptococcus thermophilus sbt1277. methods and results: thermophilin 1277 was purified and partial n-terminal sequence analysis revealed 6 unidentified amino acids amongst 31 amino acids residues. a 2.7-kbp region containing the thermophilin 1277 structural gene (tepa) encoding 58 amino acids was cloned and sequenced. mature thermophilin 1277 (33 amino acids) was preceded  by a 25-amino acid putative leader peptide containing a double glycine cleavage motif. peptide sequence analysis following chemical modification of thermophilin  1277 revealed that the cys21 and cys29 residues form a disulfide bridge and that  thr8 or thr10 forms two 3-methyllanthionines with cys13 or cys32 via thioether bridges. antimicrobial activity was disrupted by ethanethiol or reductive agent treatments, indicating that the internal amino acid modifications are crucial for the activity. conclusions: thermophilin 1277 from strep. thermophilus sbt1277 belongs to the class of aii-type lantibiotics that has a disulfide and two thioether bridges. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report of a lantibiotic produced by a gras species of strep. thermophilus; thermophilin  1277 has a unique structure containing both a disulfide bridge and two thioether  bridges that are crucial for its activity.

AB  == a qualified presumption of safety (qps) approach was applied to dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) associated with grana padano cheese whey starters. thirty-two strains belonging to lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus fermentum, and representing the overall genotypic lab diversity associated with 24 previously collected whey  starters [rossetti, l., fornasari, m.e., gatti, m., lazzi, c., neviani, e., giraffa, g., 2008. grana padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution. international journal of food microbiology 127, 168-171], were analyzed. all l. helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and s. thermophilus isolates were susceptible to four (i.e. vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and erythromycin) of the clinically most relevant antibiotics. one  l. fermentum strain displayed phenotypic resistance to tetracycline (tet(r)), with mic of 32 microg/ml, and gentamycin (gm(r)), with mic of 32 microg/ml. pcr was applied to this strain to test the presence of genes tet(l), tet(m), tet(s),  and aac(6')-aph(2')-ia, which are involved in horizontal transfer of tet(r) and gm(r), respectively but no detectable amplification products were observed. according to qps criteria, we conclude that grana cheese whey starters do not present particular safety concerns.

TI  == conjugative transfer of the integrative conjugative elements icest1 and icest3 from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == integrative and conjugative elements (ices), also called conjugative transposons, are genomic islands that excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate in the genome of the recipient bacterium. the current investigation shows the intraspecies conjugative transfer of the first described ices in streptococcus thermophilus, icest1 and icest3. mitomycin c, a dna-damaging agent, derepresses icest3 conjugative transfer almost 25-fold. the icest3 host range was determined  using various members of the firmicutes as recipients. whereas numerous icest3 transconjugants of streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis were recovered, only one transconjugant of lactococcus lactis was obtained. the newly  incoming ices, except the one from l. lactis, are site-specifically integrated into the 3' end of the fda gene and are still able to excise in these transconjugants. furthermore, icest3 was retransferred from e. faecalis to s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmids carrying different parts of the icest1 recombination module were used to show that the integrase gene is required for the site-specific integration and excision of the ices, whereas the excisionase gene is required for the site-specific excision only.

TI  == the chap domain of cse functions as an endopeptidase that acts at mature septa to promote streptococcus thermophilus cell separation.
AB  == cell separation is dependent on cell wall hydrolases that cleave the peptidoglycan shared between daughter cells. in streptococcus thermophilus, this  step is performed by the cse protein whose depletion resulted in the formation of extremely long chains of cells. cse, a natural chimeric enzyme created by domain  shuffling, carries at least two important domains for its activity: the lysm expected to be responsible for the cell wall-binding and the chap domain predicted to contain the active centre. accordingly, the localization of cse on s. thermophilus cell surface has been undertaken by immunogold electron and immunofluorescence microscopies using of antibodies raised against the n-terminal end of this protein. immunolocalization shows the presence of the cse protein at  mature septa. moreover, the chap domain of cse exhibits a cell wall lytic activity in zymograms performed with cell walls of micrococcus lysodeikticus, bacillus subtilis and s. thermophilus. additionally, rp-hplc analysis of muropeptides released from b. subtilis and s. thermophilus cell wall after digestion with the chap domain shows that cse is an endopeptidase. altogether, these results suggest that cse is a cell wall hydrolase involved in daughter cell separation of s. thermophilus.

TI  == fat-free yogurt made using a galactose-positive exopolysaccharide-producing recombinant strain of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == to prevent textural defects in low-fat and fat-free yogurts, fat substitutes are  routinely added to milk. in situ production of exopolysaccharides (eps) by starter cultures is an acknowledged alternative to the addition of biothickeners. with the aim of increasing in situ eps production, a recombinant galactose-positive eps(+) streptococcus thermophilus strain, rd-534-s1, was generated and compared with the parent galactose-negative eps(+) strain rd-534. the rd-534-s1 strain produced up to 84 mg/l of eps during a single-strain milk fermentation process, which represented 1.3 times more than the eps produced by strain rd-534. under conditions that mimic industrial yogurt production, the starter culture consisting of rd-534-s1 and (eps(-)) lactobacillus bulgaricus l210r strain (rd-534-s1/l210r) led to an eps production increase of 1.65-fold as  compared with rd-534-s1 alone. however, the amount of eps produced did not differ from that found in yogurts produced using an isogenic starter culture that included the parent s. thermophilus strain rd-534 and lb. bulgaricus l210r (rd-534/l210r). moreover, the gel characteristics of set-style yogurt and the rheological properties of stirred-style yogurt produced using rd-534-s1/l210r were similar to the values obtained for yogurts made with rd-534/l210r. in conclusion, it is possible to increase the production of eps by ropy s. thermophilus strains through genetic engineering of galactose metabolism. however, when used in combination with lb. bulgaricus for yogurt manufacture, the eps overproduction of recombinant strain is not significant.

TI  == effect of inactivation of stress response regulators on the growth and survival of streptococcus thermophilus sfi39.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is an important dairy starter used for the manufacture of fermented milks and cheeses. as for many other lactic acid bacteria, its survival during propagation and preservation of starter cultures and its performance in dairy fermentations are significantly affected by its ability to cope with many environmental stresses. this, in turn, is dependent on the expression of a several genes, which is often controlled by negative response regulators, and has complex relationships with the control of metabolism. in this paper we describe the effect of growth phase, adaptation and inactivation of genes for stress response regulators (hrca, ctsr and rr01) on the growth, acid production and stress resistance and intracellular protein patterns in the yoghurt strain s. thermophilus sfi39. inactivation of stress response regulators  significantly affected growth, acid production in milk and stress tolerance. although mutants showed an increased resistance during the exponential phase compared to the wild type strain, the effect of the mutations was complex and in  some cases mutants were unable to mount an acid- or heat-shock response after exposure to mild heat and acid stresses. significant differences in intracellular protein patterns analyzed by sds-page and 2-de/mass spectrometry were found as a  function of growth phase, adaptation and mutation, but a detailed transcriptomic  and proteomic study would be needed to provide a mechanistic interpretation of the effect of the mutations and to identify a strategy for the construction of food-grade mutants with improved growth and performances.

TI  == postgenomic analysis of streptococcus thermophilus cocultivated in milk with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus: involvement of nitrogen, purine, and iron metabolism.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is one of the most widely used lactic acid bacteria in the dairy industry, in particular in yoghurt manufacture, where it is associated  with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. this bacterial association, known as a proto-cooperation, is poorly documented at the molecular and regulatory levels. we thus investigate the kinetics of the transcriptomic and proteomic modifications of s. thermophilus lmg 18311 in response to the presence  of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 during growth in milk at two growth stages. seventy-seven different genes or proteins (4.1% of total coding sequences), implicated mainly in the metabolism of nitrogen (24%), nucleotide base (21%), and iron (20%), varied specifically in coculture. one of the most unpredicted results was a significant decrease of most of the transcripts and enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis. interestingly, the expression of nearly  all genes potentially encoding iron transporters of s. thermophilus decreased, whereas that of iron-chelating dpr as well as that of the fur (perr) regulator genes increased, suggesting a reduction in the intracellular iron concentration,  probably in response to h(2)o(2) production by l. bulgaricus. the present study reveals undocumented nutritional exchanges and regulatory relationships between the two yoghurt bacteria, which provide new molecular clues for the understanding of their associative behavior.

TI  == fluorescent-box-pcr for resolving bacterial genetic diversity, endemism and biogeography.
AB  == background: box-a1r-based repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr (box-pcr) is one  of the most used techniques in biogeography studies of microbial isolates. however the traditional separation of box-pcr patterns by agarose gel electrophoresis suffers many limitations. the aim of this research was to set up  a fluorescent box-pcr (f-box-pcr) assay in which separation of pcr products is automated in a capillary electrophoresis system. f-box-pcr was compared with the  traditional box-pcr using bacterial strains with different g+c content (bacillus  cereus; escherichia coli; isolates of the family geodermatophilaceae). resolution, discriminatory power and reproducibility were evaluated by assaying different electrophoretic runs, pcr reactions and independent dna extractions. box-pcr and f-box-pcr were compared for the analysis of 29 strains of modestobacter multiseptatus isolated from three different microsites in an altered carbonatic wall from cagliari, italy, and 45 strains of streptococcus thermophilus isolated from 34 samples of the hand-made, yogurt-like product matsoni, collected in different locations in georgia. results: fluorophore 6-fam  proved more informative than hex and box-pcr both in agarose gel electrophoresis  (p < 0.004 and p < 0.00003) and in capillary electrophoresis (compared only with  hex, p < 2 x 10(-7)). 6-fam- and hex-based f-box-pcr respectively detected up to  12.0 and 11.3 times more fragments than box-pcr. replicate separations of f-box-pcr showed an accuracy of the size calling of +/- 0.5 bp until 500 bp, constantly decreasing to +/- 10 bp at 2000 bp. cluster analysis of f-box-pcr profiles grouped m. multiseptatus strains according to the microsite of isolation and s. thermophilus strains according to the geographical origin of matsoni, but  resulted intermixed when a box-pcr dataset was used. conclusion: f-box-pcr represents an improved method for addressing bacterial biogeography studies both  in term of sensitivity, reproducibility and data analysis.

AB  == in traditional yogurt manufacturing, the yogurt is not agitated during fermentation. however, stirring could be beneficial, particularly for improving heat and mass transport across the fermentation tank. in this contribution, we studied the effect of low-speed agitation during fermentation on process time, acidity profile, and microbial dynamics during yogurt fermentation in 2 laboratory-scale fermenters (3 and 5 l) with different heat-transfer characteristics. lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus were used as fermenting bacteria. curves of ph, lactic acid concentration, lactose concentration, and bacterial population profiles during fermentation are presented for static and low-agitation conditions during fermentation. at low-inoculum conditions, agitation reduced the processing time by shortening the  lag phase. however, mixing did not modify the duration or the shape of the ph profiles during the exponential phase. in fermentors with poor heat-transfer characteristics, important differences in microbial dynamics were observed between the agitated and nonagitated fermentation experiments; that is, agitation significantly increased the observable specific growth rate and the final microbial count of l. bulgaricus.

AB  == indigenous yeasts can be detected at high populations in raw milk cantal cheese,  a french protected denomination of origin (pdo) hard cheese. to investigate their use as adjunct cultures to promote flavour development in cantalet (small cantal) cheese, three strains isolated from raw milk cantal cheese, kluyveromyces lactis, yarrowia lipolytica, and pichia fermentans were added at 3 (e3) and 5 (e5) log(10) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml to microfiltered milk at a ratio of 80/10/10 viable cells, respectively. the global microbial, compositional and biochemical changes induced by the presence of yeasts in cheese were determined.  adjunct yeasts did not grow but stayed at viable populations of approximately 4 and 6 log(10) cfu/g in e3 and e5 cheeses, respectively, throughout the ripening period. they were mainly constituted of k. lactis, while p. fermentans and y. lipolytica were not detectable after 3 and 45 days of ripening, respectively. several species of indigenous yeasts were also detected in e3 cheeses at the beginning of ripening only, and in the control cheeses without yeasts added. lactoccoci survived for longer periods in the presence of yeast adjuncts, while,  conversely, the viability of streptococcus thermophilus decreased more rapidly. the addition of yeasts did not influence cheese composition and total free amino  acid content. in contrast, it slightly increased lipolysis in both e3 and e5 cheeses and markedly enhanced the formation of some volatile aroma compounds. the concentrations of ethanol, ethyl esters and some branched-chain alcohols were 6 to 10 fold higher in e5 cheeses than in the control cheeses, and only slightly higher in e3 cheeses. this study shows that k. lactis has a potential as cheese adjunct culture in cantalet cheese and that, added at populations of 4-5 log(10)  cfu/g cheese, it enhances the formation of flavour compounds.

TI  == multiple interactions between streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus delbrueckii strongly affect their growth kinetics during the making of hard cooked cheeses.
AB  == in hard cooked cheeses, any interactions between the thermophilic starters as they grow during the cheese-making are critical, since they modify bacterial growth kinetics and acidification kinetics, so affecting the ripening process and the final characteristics of the cheese. twenty-four experimental hard cooked cheeses were made under controlled conditions, the milk being inoculated with various combinations of thermophilic strains of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus delbrueckii. over the first day of manufacturing we recorded a wide range of different growth kinetics for each starter species used, and a wide range of ph kinetics, depending on the starter combination. most of the bacterial variability could be statistically explained by the nature, quantity, and/or presence or absence of the different strains inoculated. four main interactions between the three species were evidenced during cheese-making. there was antagonism between l. helveticus and l. delbrueckii. the lactobacilli had a positive effect on s. thermophilus, which was reciprocal for l. helveticus. l. helveticus had a negative effect on s. thermophilus cultivability. and the combination of s. thermophilus inoculated in  large quantities and l. helveticus strain h2 had a negative effect on the growth  of the l. delbrueckii strain d2. while the positive effect of l. delbrueckii on s. thermophilus probably corresponds to interactions in milk that have already been described and published, the other interactions were hitherto unknown. these interactions are of major importance for the growth kinetics of streptococci and  thermophilic lactobacilli during cheese-making.

TI  == preventive effect of streptococcus thermophilus yit 2001 on dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice.
AB  == we investigated the preventive effect of streptococcus thermophilus yit 2001, a lactic acid bacterum having high antioxidative activity, on acute colitis induced by 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium in mice, and compared the effect with that of s. thermophilus yit 2084 which has lower antioxidative activity. feeding s. thermophilus yit 2001 decreased the disease activity index and level of lipid peroxide (the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance content) in the colonic mucosa. the hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations in the blood of s. thermophilus yit 2001-fed mice were higher than those of the control mice. s. thermophilus yit 2084 had no significant effect on these parameters. the results  suggest that the antioxidative activity of s. thermophilus yit 2001 was involved  in the improving effect on colitis.

TI  == short communication: impact of ph and temperature on the acidifying activity of carnobacterium maltaromaticum.
AB  == the acidifying activity of carnobacterium maltaromaticum lma28, a strain isolated from french soft cheese, was studied in trypticase soy broth with yeast extract (tsb-ye) medium and in milk. in tsb-ye supplemented with lactose, glucose, or galactose, lactose and glucose were metabolized with a maximum growth rate of 0.32 h(-1) and galactose was not metabolized. during hydrolysis of lactose, the galactose moiety was not excreted. the major product was l(+) lactic acid, with no significant difference in the lactic acid yield. glucose was not completely metabolized because cell growth stopped when ph values reached an average of 5.0. in sterilized uht milk, the addition of 1 g/l of ye enhanced its coagulation. compared with commercial starter lactic acid bacteria such as lactococcus lactis  dsmz 20481 or streptococcus thermophilus inra 302, carnobacterium maltaromaticum  lma 28 was shown to be a slow acidifying strain. however, in spite of this weak acidifying ability, c. maltaromaticum lma 28 can sustain low ph values in coculture with lc. lactis dsmz 20481 or s. thermophilus inra 302. the individual  and interactive effects of initial ph values (5.2 to 8.0) and incubation temperatures (23 to 37 degrees c) on acidifying activity were studied by response surface methodology. the 3 strains displayed different behaviors depending on ph  and temperature. the psychrotrophic lactic acid strain c. maltaromaticum lma 28 was able to grow at alkaline ph values and during storage conditions. it could be used as a potential ripening flora in soft cheese.

TI  == solute carriers (slc) in inflammatory bowel disease: a potential target of probiotics?
AB  == transporter proteins of the solute carriers (slcs) family play a role in epithelial permeability and barrier function in the intestine, and polymorphisms  in slc genes are associated with inflammatory bowel disease. many slcs also mediate the bioavailability of pharmaceutical compounds, and the modulation of such transport systems to increase drug efficacy is, therefore, of great interest. we have undertaken a large-scale project to evaluate whether bacteria can modulate the expression of slcs in the intestine. here we report the effect of vsl[sharp]3 (a high-potency probiotic preparation) on the expression of 3 large solute carrier families, slc4, slc21, and slc22, which are involved in the  transport of bicarbonates, organic anions and cations, and affect the bioavailability of several pharmaceutical compounds. two groups of animals (vsl[sharp]3 and phosphate-buffered saline controls) were studied for slc expression in the intestine by real-time pcr at the beginning (day 1) and at the  end (day 20) of the treatment, and 7 days after the interruption of the treatment. an effect of vsl[sharp]3 administration was detected on the expression of 10% of the studied genes. this reached statistical significance (p=0.01) for the poorly characterized sodium-borate cotransporter slc4a11, which showed a 5-times lower expression in vsl[sharp]3 than in control mice on day 1 of probiotic treatment. vsl[sharp]3-driven changes in the expression levels of slc transporters might contribute to its reported effects on intestinal permeability. the elucidation of slc4a11 function in the intestine will be the key to fully evaluate the relevance of specific findings.

TI  == use of probiotic bacteria for prevention and therapy of allergic diseases: studies in mouse model of allergic sensitization.
AB  == probiotic bacteria as modulators of the immune response have been intensively studied in reducing the risk of immune-mediated diseases, including atopic diseases. results from in vitro studies demonstrated that probiotics may modify the polarization of immune cells, supporting potential therapeutic effects in atopic diseases. several clinical studies have been designed to explore the effective role of probiotics in the modulation of allergic diseases. the results  of these studies, although promising, are not conclusive yet and are considered insufficient to recommend probiotics as a part of standard therapy in any allergic conditions. in vivo studies on animal models can provide useful information on the immunologic mechanisms responsible for the potential antiallergic effects of probiotic bacteria. the immunomodulatory activity of the  probiotic mixture vsl#3 has been studied in the mouse models of allergic sensitization and anaphylaxis developed in our laboratory with inhalant and food  allergens, according to a prophylactic setting by the intranasal route (inhalant  allergy model) or a therapeutic setting by the oral route (food allergy model). intranasally delivered probiotic bacteria prevented the development of parietaria major allergen-specific response, by down-regulating t helper cell 2 responses at the local and systemic level. oral therapeutic treatment was able to reduce both  systemic and local anaphylactic symptoms induced by oral challenge with the sensitizing allergen shrimp tropomyosin. the induction of protective immune responses at the sites of allergen exposure linked to counterregulatory local and systemic immune responses by mucosal delivery of probiotic bacteria mixtures might become an effective strategy in the prevention and therapy of allergic diseases.

TI  == use of vsl[sharp]3 in the treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in children: preliminary results.
AB  == we conducted a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of vsl[sharp]3 (cd pharma india) in the treatment of acute rotavirus diarrhea in children. the patients were randomly assigned to receive 4 days of oral treatment with vsl[sharp]3 probiotic mixture or placebo in addition to usual care for diarrhea. results: out of 230 rotavirus-positive acute diarrhea children, 224 children completed the study, (113 in the drug group and 111 in the placebo group). at recruitment on day 1, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of frequency of vomiting, mean loose stool frequency, stool consistency, and mean frequency of oral rehydration salts  (ors) and intravenous fluids administered. on day 2, a lower mean stool frequency and improved stool consistency was noted in the drug group, which achieved statistical significance. this was also reflected in the lower volume of ors administration in the drug group. even on day 3, mean loose stool frequency and frequency of ors use and frequency of intravenous fluid use was significantly lower in the drug group. the differences in the frequency of loose stools persisted till 8 hours of day 4. after this, as the placebo group also showed spontaneous improvement the difference between the 2 groups in terms of the overall stools frequency became comparable. however, the overall ors requirement  continued to be significantly lower in the drug group even on day 4. the overall  recovery rates were significantly better in the drug group compared with placebo. no side effects were noted with the use of the probiotic mixture. use of probiotic mixture vsl[sharp]3 in acute rotavirus diarrhea resulted in earlier recovery and reduced frequency of ors administration reflecting decreased stool volume losses during diarrhea.

TI  == physiology of streptococcus thermophilus during the late stage of milk fermentation with special regard to sulfur amino-acid metabolism.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is a thermophilic lactic acid bacterium widely used as starter in the manufacture of dairy products in particular in yoghurt manufacture in combination with lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. however, in spite  of its massive use, the physiological state of s. thermophilus in milk has hardly been investigated. we established the first map of the cytosolic proteome of s. thermophilus lmg18311 grown in milk. it comprises 203 identified proteins corresponding to 32% of theoretical proteome. in addition, using proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we analyzed the physiology of lmg18311 during its late stage of growth in milk (between 2h30 and 5h30). it revealed the up-regulation of (i) peptides and aa transporters and of specific aa biosynthetic pathways notably for sulfur aa and (ii) genes and proteins involved in the metabolism of various sugars. these two effects were also observed in lmg18311 grown in milk in coculture with l. bulgaricus although the effect on sugar metabolism was less pronounced. it suggests that the stimulatory effect of lactobacillus on the streptococcus growth is more complex than aa or peptides supply.

TI  == potentially probiotic bacteria induce efficient maturation but differential cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.
AB  == aim: to analyze the ability of nine different potentially probiotic bacteria to induce maturation and cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (modcs). methods: cytokine production and maturation of modcs in response to bacterial stimulation was analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and flow cytometric analysis (facs), respectively. the kinetics of mrna expression of cytokine genes was determined by northern blotting. the involvement of different signaling pathways in cytokine gene expression was studied using specific pharmacological signaling inhibitors. results: all studied bacteria induced the maturation of modcs in a dose-dependent manner. more detailed analysis with s. thermophilus ths, b. breve bb99, and l. lactis subsp. cremoris arh74 indicated that these bacteria induced the expression of modc maturation markers hla class ii and cd86 as efficiently as pathogenic bacteria. however, these bacteria differed in their ability to induce modc cytokine gene expression. s. thermophilus induced the expression of pro-inflammatory (tnf-alpha, il-12, il-6, and ccl20) and th1 type (il-12 and ifn-gamma) cytokines, while b. breve and l. lactis were also potent inducers of anti-inflammatory il-10. mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) p38, phosphatidylinositol 3 (pi3) kinase, and nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) signaling pathways were shown to be involved in bacteria-induced cytokine production. conclusion: our results indicate that potentially probiotic bacteria are able to induce modc maturation, but their ability to induce cytokine gene expression varies significantly from one bacterial strain to another.

AB  == this study investigated the influence of incorporating raftiline hp on the ph, growth, proteolytic, and angiotensin-i converting enzyme inhibitory activities and on spontaneous whey separation, firmness, and rheological properties of low-fat yogurts during storage for 28 d at 4 degrees c. three types of yogurts were prepared from skim milk containing 0% (yi0, control), 2% (yi2), and 3% (yi3) raftiline hp, respectively. the incorporation of raftiline hp improved the growth of starter organisms, particularly that of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, resulting in shorter fermentation time. there was a significant improvement in total proteolysis, which was highest in yogurt containing 3% raftiline hp. the ace inhibitory activity was maximal in yi3 compared to yi2 and  yi0. incorporation of raftiline hp did not affect whey separation and firmness of the low-fat yogurts. all these products were more fluid like with distinct pseudoplastic properties and lesser ability to resist deformation upon applied shear.

TI  == effect of addition of versagel on microbial, chemical, and physical properties of low-fat yogurt.

AB  == background: this study was performed to evaluate whether the addition of probiotics to proton pump inhibitor (ppi)-based triple therapy increases the likelihood of successful helicobacter pylori eradication. materials and methods:  three hundred and forty-seven h. pylori-infected patients were randomized into a  triple-plus-yogurt group (yogurt group, n = 168) or a triple-only group (control  group, n = 179). triple therapy consisted of ppi b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 7 days. yogurt group received triple therapy for 1 week and one bottle of will yogurt per day for at 3 weeks, starting on the first day of triple therapy. will yogurt (a korean brand) contains lactobacillus acidophilus hy2177, lactobacillus casei hy2743, bifidobacterium longum hy8001, and streptococcus thermophilus b-1. (13)c-urea breath test was performed at least 4 weeks after completion of triple therapy. eradication rates, compliances, and adverse events were compared. results: by intention-to treat analysis the h. pylori eradication rates in the yogurt group 79.2% (133 of 168) was similar to that in the control group 72.1% (129 of 179) (p = .124). however,  by per-protocol (pp) analysis, the eradication rate in the yogurt group, 87.5% (133 of 152) was higher than that in the control group, 78.7% (129 of 164) (p = .037). common adverse events were metallic taste (11.8%) and diarrhea (8.6%). the frequency of adverse effects in the yogurt group 41.1% (69/168) were higher than  in the control group, 26.3% (47 of 179) (p = .003). however, most adverse events  were mild to moderate in intensity, and the severities of adverse effects were similar in both groups (p = .401). conclusions: the addition of will yogurt to triple therapy did not reduce the side-effects of triple therapy. but it increased the h. pylori eradication rate by pp analysis, encouraging more research in this field.

TI  == polyphasic approach to bacterial dynamics during the ripening of spanish farmhouse cheese, using culture-dependent and -independent methods.
AB  == we studied the dynamics of the microbial population during ripening of cueva de la magaha cheese using a combination of classical and molecular techniques. samples taken during ripening of this spanish goat's milk cheese in which lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus were used as starter cultures were analyzed. all bacterial isolates were clustered by using randomly amplified  polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing, species-specific pcr, and multiplex pcr. our results indicate that the majority of the 225 strains isolated and enumerated on solid media during the ripening period were nonstarter lactic acid bacteria, and lactobacillus paracasei was the  most abundant species. other lactobacillus species, such as lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus parabuchneri, were also detected at the beginning and end of ripening, respectively. non-lactic-acid bacteria, mainly kocuria and staphylococcus strains, were also detected at the end of the ripening period. microbial community dynamics determined by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise estimate of the distribution of bacteria  and enabled us to detect lactobacillus curvatus and the starter bacteria s. thermophilus and l. lactis, which were not isolated. surprisingly, the bacterium  most frequently found using culture-dependent analysis, l. paracasei, was scarcely detected by this molecular approach. finally, we studied the composition of the lactobacilli and their evolution by using length heterogeneity pcr.

TI  == microbiological, chemical, and sensory characteristics of swiss cheese manufactured with adjunct lactobacillus strains using a low cooking temperature.
AB  == the effect of nonstarter lactobacillus adjunct cultures on the microbial, chemical, and sensory characteristics of swiss cheese manufactured using the "kosher make procedure" was investigated. the kosher make procedure, which uses a lower cooking temperature than traditional swiss cheese making, is used by many american cheese manufacturers to allow for kosher-certified whey. cheeses were manufactured using a commercial starter culture combination and 1 of 3 non-starter lactobacillus strains previously isolated from swiss cheeses, lactobacillus casei a26, l. casei b21, and lactobacillus rhamnosus h2, as an adjunct. control cheeses lacked the adjunct culture. cheeses were analyzed during ripening for microbial and chemical composition. adjunct strain l. casei a26, which utilized citrate most readily in laboratory medium, dominated the lactobacillus population within 30 d, faster than the other adjunct cultures. there were no significant differences in propionibacterium counts, streptococcus  thermophilus counts, protein, fat, moisture, salt, and ph among the cheeses. free amino acid concentration ranged from 5 to 7 mmol/100 g of cheese at 90 d of ripening and was adjunct strain dependent. lactic, acetic, and propionic acid concentrations were not significantly different among the cheeses after a 90-d ripening period; however differences in propionic acid concentrations were apparent at 60 d, with the cheeses made with l. casei adjuncts containing less propionic acid. citric acid was depleted by the end of warm room ripening in cheeses manufactured with adjunct l. casei strains, but not with adjunct l. rhamnosus. cheeses made with l. casei a26 were most similar to the control cheeses in diacetyl and butyric/isobutyric acid abundance as evaluated by electronic nose during the first 3 mo of ripening. the 4 cheese types differed in their descriptive sensory profiles at 8 mo of age, indicating an adjunct strain-dependent effect on particular flavor attributes. adjunct lactobacillus spp. affected the flavor profile and concentration of some flavor compounds in swiss cheeses produced with the kosher make procedure. use of adjunct lactobacillus cultures provides swiss cheese makers using a low cooking temperature with a means to control the dominant lactobacillus strain during ripening, reduce citrate concentration, and modify cheese flavor.

TI  == therapeutic potential of two probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease as observed in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid model of colitis.
AB  == purpose: the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is thought to be a multifactorial process. one of the leading hypotheses is that an imbalance in normal gut flora induces an excessive immune response and contributes to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. administration of probiotic bacteria  reduces symptoms in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, probably via both manipulation of the microflora and stimulation of the intestinal immune  system. in the current study the therapeutic potential of two different probiotics-lactobacillus gg and a mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium longum (yo-mix y 109 fro 1000)--in a rat model of colitis were evaluated. methods: male wistar rats were administered probiotics for three days simultaneously with colitis induction. colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically and colonic tissues, as well as fecal samples, were used for bacterial studies using 16s rrna gene primers. results: probiotics administration reduced the relative amounts of  the pathogenic bacteria aeromonas and escherichia coli in the colonic tissue. however, whereas both probiotics affected colon morphology, only lactobacillus gg administration reduced myeloperoxidase activity. conclusions: we report the therapeutic rather than preventive potential of two different probiotics in an animal model of colitis.

TI  == grana padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the species composition and the genotypic strain heterogeneity of dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from whey starter cultures used to manufacture grana padano cheese. twenty-four grana padano cheese whey starters collected from dairies located over a wide geographic production area in the north of italy were analyzed. total thermophilic lab streptococci and lactobacilli were quantified by agar plate counting. population  structure of the dominant and metabolically active lab species present in the starters was profiled by reverse transcriptase, length heterogeneity-pcr (rt-lh-pcr), a culture-independent technique successfully applied to study whey starter ecosystems. the dominant bacterial species were lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus fermentum. diversity in the species composition allowed the whey cultures to be grouped into four main typologies, the one containing l. helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and s. thermophilus being the most frequent one (45% of the cultures analyzed), followed by that containing only the two lactobacilli (40%). only a minor fraction of the cultures contained l. helveticus alone (4%) or all the four lab species (11%). five hundred and twelve  strains were isolated from the 24 cultures and identified by m13-pcr fingerprinting coupled with 16s rrna gene sequencing. most of the strains were l. helveticus (190 strains; 37% of the total), l delbrueckii subsp. lactis (90 strains; 18%) and s. thermophilus (215 strains; 42%). this result was in good agreement with the qualitative whey starter composition observed by rt-lh-pcr. m13-pcr fingerprinting indicated a markedly low infra-species diversity, i.e. the same biotypes were often found in more than one culture. the distribution of the  biotypes into the different cultures was mainly dairy plant-specific rather than  correlated with the different production areas.

TI  == molecular methods for identification of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus using methionine biosynthesis and 16s rrna genes.
AB  == yoghurt and starter culture producers are still searching strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus to produce healthier yogurt with longer shelf life, better texture, taste and quality. however, selective identification of lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and strep. thermophilus from a mixed population using microbiological and biochemical methods is difficult, time consuming and may not be accurate. in this study, a quick, sensitive and accurate method is proposed to identify both lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and strep. thermophilus using pcr. the method is comprised of two parts. in the first part, methionine biosynthesis genes, known to be present in both species were partially amplified by designed primers (cysmet2f and cysmet2r). partial amplification of the methionine biosynthesis gene which gives 700 bp fragment resulted in selective identification of lb. bulgaricus and strep. thermophilus. all 16 lb. bulgaricus and 6 strep. thermophilus isolates assessed by this method gave the expected amplification. on the other hand, further analysis of other closely related species with the same primers have indicated that the same product was also amplified in two more lactobacilli namely, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lb. helveticus species. thus, in the second part of the method, further differentiation of lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and strep. thermophilus from each other and these species was achieved using restriction analysis of 16s rrna gene with ecori.

TI  == rerouting of pyruvate metabolism during acid adaptation in lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) gradually acidify their environment through the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, an essential process to regenerate nad(+) used during glycolysis. a clear demonstration of acidification can be found in yogurt, the product of milk fermentation by the lab lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) and streptococcus thermophilus, where the ph falls to  4.2. acid adaptation therefore plays an important role in the physiology of lab.  here we present the results of a proteomic approach to reveal cellular changes associated with acid adaptation in l. bulgaricus. these results were complemented with transcription data for selected genes to show three major effects: (i) induction of the chaperones groes, groel, hrca, grpe, dnak, dnaj, clpe, clpp, and clpl, and the repression of clpc; (ii) induction of genes involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids (fabh, accc, fabi); (iii) repression of genes involved in the mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid synthesis (mvac, mvas). together with changes in the expression of other genes from the local metabolic network, these results for the first time show a coherent picture of changes in gene expression expected to result in a rerouting of pyruvate metabolism to favor fatty acid biosynthesis, and thereby affect membrane fluidity.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic escherichia coli (e. coli) in vitro and in vivo. escherichia coli was co-cultured in vitro with each probiotic  strain individually, and a mixture of the four strains and its population was counted at various time points. we also collected a cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) of each probiotic strain and the four-strain mix to examine their antibacterial activity, using the cylinder plate method. results demonstrated that co-culture with probiotics significantly reduced the number of e. coli. the  different sizes of the inhibition zones made by each cfcs proved that e. coli was inhibited by the metabolites of the probiotics. in vivo, kunming mice were allocated to different groups supplemented with selenium-enriched and other probiotics. after 28 days, the mice were inoculated with pathogenic e. coli so that we could compare mortality rates and inspect other indexes of each treatment. the mortality of the group with selenium-enriched probiotics was the lowest. in addition, the organic antioxidant status improved, immunity was fortified, and the internal environment of the intestinal tract was enhanced with selenium-enriched probiotic supplementation. in conclusion, selenium-enriched probiotics can strongly antagonize pathogenic e. coli in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == growth and activity of bulgarian yogurt starter culture in iron-fortified milk.
AB  == bulgarian yogurts were manufactured and fortified with 8, 15 and 27 mg of iron kg(-1) of yogurt. the growth and acidifying activity of the starter culture bacteria streptococcus thermophilus 13a and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2-11 were monitored during milk fermentation and over 15 days of yogurt storage at 4 degrees c. fortifying milk with iron did not affect significantly the growth of the starter culture during manufacture and storage of yogurt. counts of yogurt bacteria at the end of fermentation of iron-fortified milks were between 2.1 x 10(10) and 4.6 x 10(10) cfu ml(-1), which were not significantly different from numbers in unfortified yogurts. in all batches of yogurt, the viable cell counts of s. thermophilus 13a were approximately three times higher than those of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2-11. greater decrease in viable cell count over 15 days of storage was observed for s. thermophilus 13a compared to l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2-11. intensive accumulation of lactic acid was observed during incubation of milk and all batches reached ph 4.5 +/- 0.1 after 3.0 h. at the end of fermentation process, lactic acid concentrations in iron-fortified yogurts were between 6.9 +/- 0.4 and 7.3 +/- 0.5 g l(-1). the acidifying activity of starter culture bacteria in the control and iron-fortified milks was similar. there was no increase in oxidized,  metallic and bitter off-flavors in iron-fortified yogurts compared to the control. iron-fortified yogurts did not differ significantly in their sensorial,  chemical and microbiological characteristics with unfortified yogurt, suggesting  that yogurt is a suitable vehicle for iron fortification and that the ferrous lactate is an appropriate iron source for yogurt fortification.

TI  == effect of infant formula with probiotics on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == weaning during infancy refers to the initiation of complementary food to breast milk. during weaning, there are significant changes on the gastrointestinal microbiota. deleterious alterations of the gastrointestinal microbiota can result in pathological processes while measures that stimulate its development and stability, like the use of probiotics, are beneficial. the mechanisms by which probiotics achieve their effects have not been clearly established. present work  compares the microbial composition of feces from infants that were weaned to regular family food, formula with probiotics (b. lactis bl y s. thermophilus) or  formula without probiotics. accordingly, analysis of rdna of microbial fecal samples by molecular techniques was used. formula with or without probiotics was  well tolerated and safe for all participating children. probiotics present in formula were viable and susceptible to culture. there was not difference on physical growth or development among all participants. the microbiota of children supplemented with formula with- or without probiotics was different than that observed in children supplemented with regular food. it was not possible to determine enrichment of b. lactis bl and s. thermophilus in the feces of children that consumed the probiotics. present work contributes to the understanding of probiotics effects in human health.

TI  == microflora of feta cheese from four greek manufacturers.
AB  == the components of the microflora of four feta cheeses, produced by different greek manufacturers, were determined by culture dependent and independent techniques. isolates from microbiological media were first grouped by polymerase  chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and then representatives of each dgge group were sequenced for identification purposes. dna and rna, extracted directly from the cheese, were subjected to pcr-dgge. moreover, feta cheeses were subjected to fish analysis in order to identify viable bacterial populations. the microbial ecology, as represented by the lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeast populations, was different for the four cheeses. the main lab species isolated were lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus coryniformis and lactobacillus fermentum. however, some inconsistencies were observed between the results obtained with the culture dependent and the culture independent approach. in the case of the yeasts, the results obtained by pcr-dgge compared very well with those obtained by the conventional microbiological analysis and the main species found were kluyveromyces lactis, pichia fermentans and c. zeylanoides. fish analysis highlighted viable but not culturable populations of streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus spp. rapd-pcr performed on the l. plantarum isolates revealed a cheese specific distribution and a temperature dependent clustering.

TI  == fate and effects of camembert cheese micro-organisms in the human colonic microbiota of healthy volunteers after regular camembert consumption.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine i) if camembert cheese micro-organisms could be detected in fecal samples after regular consumption by human subjects and ii) the consequence of this consumption on global metabolic activities of the host colonic microbiota. an open human protocol was designed where 12 healthy volunteers were included: a 2-week period of fermented products  exclusion followed by a 4-weeks camembert ingestion period where 2x40 g/day of camembert cheese was consumed. stools were collected from the volunteers before consumption, twice during the ingestion period (2nd and 4th week) and once after  a wash out period of 2 weeks. during the consumption of camembert cheese, high levels of lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were measured in fecal samples using real-time quantitative pcr, reaching median values of 8.2 and 7.5 log(10) genome equivalents/g of stool. for ln. mesenteroides, persistence was observed 15 days after the end of camembert consumption. the survival of geotrichum candidum was also assessed and the fecal concentration reached a median level of 7.1 log(10) cfu/g in stools. except a decreasing trend of the nitrate reductase activity, no significant modification was shown in the metabolic activities during this study.

TI  == modelling the survival of starter lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium bifidum in single and simultaneous cultures.
AB  == the inactivation kinetics at 4 degrees c of bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, cultured alone or consociated in a laboratory medium (modified mrs broth), were modelled through the weibull model and a second-order polynomial equation. the initial cell number of s. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was approximately 6-7log (cfu/ml); the viability loss after 30 days of storage was 2.87 and 1.99log (cfu/l) for l. delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, cultured alone, respectively; whereas the consociation of lactobacilli and streptococci with bifidobacteria reduced viability loss during storage (0.28 and  0.54log cfu/l for lactobacilli and streptococci, respectively). finally, the consociation of lactobacilli and streptococci with b. bifidum improved their oxygen uptake.

TI  == streptococcus thermophilus core genome: comparative genome hybridization study of 47 strains.
AB  == a dna microarray platform based on 2,200 genes from publicly available sequences  was designed for streptococcus thermophilus. we determined how single-nucleotide  polymorphisms in the 65- to 75-mer oligonucleotide probe sequences affect the hybridization signals. the microarrays were then used for comparative genome hybridization (cgh) of 47 dairy s. thermophilus strains. an analysis of the exopolysaccharide genes in each strain confirmed previous findings that this class of genes is indeed highly variable. a phylogenetic tree based on the cgh data showed similar distances for most strains, indicating frequent recombination or gene transfer within s. thermophilus. by comparing genome sizes estimated from the microarrays and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the amount of unknown dna in each strain was estimated. a core genome comprised of 1,271 genes detected in  all 47 strains was identified. likewise, a set of noncore genes detected in only  some strains was identified. the concept of an industrial core genome is proposed. this is comprised of the genes in the core genome plus genes that are necessary in an applied industrial context.

TI  == antibacterial activity of yoghurt against viridans streptococci in vitro.
AB  == objective: yoghurt consumption leads to a selective decrease in the oral level of mutans streptococci. it is not clear whether this decrease is due to the bactericidal activity of yoghurt or other mechanisms. the present study investigated the differences in susceptibility to yoghurt between several strains of viridans streptococci. design: the sources of variation were minimised, at the expense of the external validity of the study, using culture collection strains.  each strain was tested separately on five occasions in planktonic form and logarithmic growth phase. two strains of each of the following streptococcus species were tested: mutans, sobrinus, gordonii, oralis, parasanguinis and sanguinis. one millilitre [10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)] of each strain was incubated (37 degrees c, 60min) with 9ml of fat-free plain yoghurt containing streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus (10(8) and 10(7)cfu/g, respectively) in gently vortexed tubes. survival rates were calculated every 15min by dividing the number of viable cells, obtained using conventional laboratory procedures, by the baseline number. results: survival rates were 8% (s. mutans 6519t), 12% (s. mutans 31738), 35% (s. oralis 25671) and >50% (all other species tested) after 15min, and 0.01% (s. mutans) and >10% (all other species tested) after 30min. overall, s. parasanguinis and s. sobrinus were the most resistant species. when heat-treated yoghurt (<10cfu/g bacteria and inactivated bacteriocins) was used, this antibacterial activity was not found. conclusion: in vitro, yoghurt with live bacteria showed selective anti-mutans activity, suggesting that the overall decrease in mutans streptococci in vivo could be due to a bactericidal effect on s. mutans but not on s. sobrinus.

TI  == probiotics for children with diarrhea: an update.
AB  == this review focuses on the efficacy of probiotics for diarrhea in children in different settings: day-care centers, diarrhea acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 5 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus), and lactobacillus reuteri. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest: statistically significant for some strains only and in any case of minimal to mild clinical importance. few trials have examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spread of diarrhea in hospitalized children, an event most commonly due to either rotavirus or clostridium difficile, and they have yielded conflicting results. overall, these studies provide only weak evidence on the efficacy of probiotics. on the other hand, a large number of trials on the role of probiotics in preventing the  onset of antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been published. most commonly employed probiotics were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium spp., streptococcus spp., and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. today, we have a large number of published clinical trials on the role of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea in children, and many of them are randomized, blinded, and controlled. they consistently show  a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii, but also l. reuteri-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, primarily rotaviral, in infants and young children of developed countries. such a beneficial effect seems to result in a reduction of diarrhea duration of little more than 1 day, and to be exerted mostly on diarrhea due to rotavirus. the effect is not only strain-dependent, but also dose-dependent, with doses of at least 10 billion/d being necessary.

TI  == production of the exopolysaccharides by streptococcus thermophilus: effect of growth conditions on fermentation kinetics and intrinsic viscosity.
AB  == production of exopolysaccharides (eps) by a commercial streptococcus thermophilus strain was evaluated at different growth conditions [temperature (32-45 degrees c), carbon source and initial nitrogen (n) content]. lactose from deproteinized whey and sucrose allowed to obtain eps yields higher than 1200 mg/mm of the consumed carbon source. intrinsic viscosity of the eps was significantly reduced  by ionic strength indicating a polyelectrolyte behavior. growth conditions used for the production of the eps had a significant effect (p<0.05) on the intrinsic  viscosity. this was attributed to the effect of growth conditions on the molecular properties of the eps [stiffness and molecular weight (mw)]. high mw eps were produced when the bacteria grew at a high specific growth rate; however  mw of the eps and specific growth rate were not linearly associated. in the lactose fermentations carried out at different temperatures specific eps synthesis rate was positive and linearly associated with the specific lactose consumption rate (r2=0.967) and specific galactose production rate (r2=0.967). critical coil overlap parameter, [eta]c*, for the eps produced in the lactose fermentations carried out at 43 and 45 degrees c was determined to be approximately 7.6, and their critical overlap concentrations (c*) were 0.45 and 0.87 g/dl, respectively.

TI  == microbial diversity in natural whey cultures used for the production of caciocavallo silano pdo cheese.
AB  == the microbial diversity of sixty-three natural whey cultures (nwcs) for the manufacture of caciocavallo silano cheese pdo was studied. the nwcs were collected from different dairies covering the whole territory of pdo production including five different regions of southern italy. the microbial species diversity was determined by direct dna extraction from nwcs and polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplification of variable regions of the 16s rrna gene followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dhplc). dgge and dhplc fingerprinting yielded the same results in terms of number of bands/peaks and specific migration/retention time of the amplicons. the dhplc technique was used in this study for the first time to assess a food-related mixed microbial community by a culture-independent approach and proved to be at least as effective as dgge in profiling species diversity in nwcs. cluster analysis of dgge and dhplc data revealed that the species-related groups of similarity were not dependent on the geographical origin of the nwcs. the presence of three groups of 10-14 nwcs at 100% of species similarity indicated that some species associations are very commonly occurring in the nwcs for caciocavallo silano cheese pdo. a rapd-pcr analysis of the nwcs was also performed for the members of the above groups and it showed that, though characterized by the same species diversity, most of the identical nwcs included  different biotypes. the sequences of dgge bands and dhplc peaks revealed the occurrence of mainly thermophilic lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus delbrueckii, l. helveticus and streptococcus thermophilus even though the mesophilic lactococcus lactis also occurred in some nwcs. in conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the microbial diversity of nwcs used for the  caciocavallo silano pdo cheese is not high, it is not dependent on the geographical origin and the same microbial species occur within the territory examined. the microbiota of fermented pdo products and its possible link with territory should be studied case by case in order to have useful evidences for the assessment of product quality and authenticity.

TI  == diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  == exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy streptococcus species s. thermophilus, s. macedonicus and s. salivarius, were exposed to acid,  osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. three strains of dairy related streptococci, lactococcus lactis atcc11454, enterococcus faecium dsm20477 and enterococcus faecalis dsm20478, were included for comparison purposes. acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. all  strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. with a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. for some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses.  matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect  of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (dnak, gpre, groel, and groes) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between  stress response and band intensity was evident.

TI  == phytosterol effects on milk and yogurt microflora.
AB  == phytosterols play a major role in functional foods. their ability to reduce serum cholesterol in humans has been widely proven and they are now being added to various dairy based products. the present study investigated the potential antimicrobial activity of phytosterols in milk and their effect on yogurt starter cultures. a commercial phytosterol (0.26% to 1.8%, w/v) preparation (cpp) consisting of ss-sitosterol, campesterol, sitostanol, and campestanol had no effect on the standard plate count (spc) and psychrotroph population in pasteurized milk stored at 4 degrees c. in addition, a challenge study employing  pseudomonas spp. in milk at 4 to 7 degrees c confirmed that the cpp was not antimicrobial. however, the addition of a dispersible cpp consisting of 0.72% phytosterol containing 0.02% to 0.03% sodium stearoyl lactylate (ssl) did appear  to affect the spc and psychrotrophic bacteria in refrigerated milk. the dispersible preparations did not, however, inhibit the growth of pseudomonas. an  investigation into the antimicrobial activity of ssl revealed that it alone had no effect on the spc in milk. the cpp had no effect on growth and acid development by lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus during yogurt production at 33 degrees c and storage at 4 degrees c for 30 d. this is seen as a beneficial feature since growth and acid development by these organisms are crucial for yogurt quality. saccaromyces cerevisiae and aspergillus ochraceous added to yogurt as typical contaminants also were not inhibited. while the ccp was somewhat antimicrobial when formulated with dispersing agents, it otherwise had no antimicrobial activity.

TI  == serine hydroxymethyl transferase from streptococcus thermophilus and l-threonine  aldolase from escherichia coli as stereocomplementary biocatalysts for the synthesis of beta-hydroxy-alpha,omega-diamino acid derivatives.
AB  == a novel serine hydroxymethyl transferase from streptococcus thermophilus (shmt) and a l-threonine aldolase from escherichia coli (lta) were used as stereocomplementary biocatalysts for the aldol addition of glycine to n-cbz amino aldehydes and benzyloxyacetaldehyde (cbz=benzyloxycarbonyl). both threonine aldolases were classified as low-specific l-allo-threonine aldolases, and by manipulating reaction parameters, such as temperature, glycine concentration, and reaction media, shmt yielded exclusively l-erythro diastereomers in 34-60 % conversion, whereas lta gave l-threo diastereomers in 30:70 to 16:84 diastereomeric ratios and with 40-68 % conversion to product. shmt is among the most stereoselective l-threonine aldolases described. this is due, among other things, to its activity-temperature dependence: at 4 degrees c shmt has high synthetic activity but negligible retroaldol activity on l-threonine. thus, the kinetic l-erythro isomer was largely favored and the reactions were virtually irreversible, highly stereoselective, and in turn, gave excellent conversion. it  was also found that treatment of the prepared n-cbz-gamma-amino-beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acid derivatives with potassium hydroxide (1 m) resulted in the spontaneous formation of 2-oxazolidinone derivatives of the beta-hydroxyl and gamma-amino groups in quantitative yield. this reaction might be useful for further chemical manipulations of the products.

TI  == whey fermentation by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria: evolution of carbohydrates and protein content.
AB  == whey, a by-product of the cheese industry usually disposed as waste, is a source  of biological and functional valuable proteins. the aim of this work was to evaluate the potentiality of three lactic acid bacteria strains to design a starter culture for developing functional whey-based drinks. fermentations were performed at 37 and 42 degrees c for 24h in reconstituted whey powder (rw). carbohydrates, organic acids and amino acids concentrations during fermentation were evaluated by rp-hplc. proteolytic activity was measured by the o-phthaldialdehyde test and hydrolysis of whey proteins was analyzed by tricine sds-page. the studied strains grew well (2-3log cfu/ml) independently of the temperature used. streptococcus thermophilus crl 804 consumed 12% of the initial  lactose concentration and produced the highest amount of lactic acid (45 mmol/l)  at 24h. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 454 was the most proteolytic (91 microg leu/ml) strain and released the branched chain amino acids leu and val. in contrast, lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636 and s. thermophilus crl 804 consumed most of the amino acids present in whey. the studied strains were able to degrade the major whey proteins, alpha-lactalbumin being degraded in a greater extent (2.2-3.4-fold) than beta-lactoglobulin. two starter cultures were evaluated for their metabolic and proteolytic activities in rw. both cultures acidified and reduced the lactose content in whey in a greater extent than the strains alone. the amino acid release was higher (86 microg/ml) for the  starter slb (strains crl 804+crl 454) than for sla (strains crl 804+crl 636, 37 microg/ml). regarding alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin degradation, no differences were observed as compared to the values obtained with the single cultures. the starter culture slb showed high potential to be used for developing fermented whey-based beverages.

TI  == increase of skin-ceramide levels in aged subjects following a short-term topical  application of bacterial sphingomyelinase from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == several studies have demonstrated that ceramides play an essential role in both the barrier and water-holding functions of healthy stratum corneum, suggesting that the dysfunction of the stratum corneum associated with ageing as well that observed in patients with several skin diseases could result from a ceramide deficiency. in a previous study our group reported a significant increase in skin ceramide levels in healthy subjects after treatment in vivo with a cream containing a preparation of streptococcus thermophilus. the presence of high levels of neutral sphingomyelinase activity in this organism was responsible for  the observed increase of stratum corneum ceramide levels, thus leading to an improvement in barrier function and maintenance of stratum corneum flexibility. the aim of the present work is to investigate the effects of the topical treatment of a streptococcus thermophilus-containing cream on ceramide levels of  stratum corneum of healthy elderly women. the ceramide levels, transepidermal water loss and capacitance were evaluated on stratum corneum sheets from the forearms of 20 healthy female subjects treated with a base cream or the same cream containing a sonicated preparation of the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus. a 2-week topical application of a sonicated streptococcus thermophilus preparation led to significant and relevant increase of stratum corneum ceramide levels. moreover, the hydration values of the treated forearm of each subject was significantly higher than control sites. these results suggest that the experimental cream was able to improve the lipid barrier and to increase a resistance against ageing-associated xerosis.

AB  == this study was conducted to examine the growth, proteolytic profiles as well as angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace) and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory potentials of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab). two strains each of yogurt bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus-1275 and 285, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus-1092 and 1368), and probiotics (l. acidophilus-4461 and 33200, and l. casei-2607 and 15286, and 1 strain of bifidobacterium longum 5022), were cultivated in reconstituted skim milk (rsm) at 37 degrees c and their proteolytic profiles and ace as well as alpha-glu inhibitory activities were determined. among all the strains of lactic acid bacteria studied, yogurt bacteria grew very well, with the exception of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 which showed a slower growth during the initial  3 h of incubation. the growth pattern corresponded well with the decrease in ph for the organisms. all the organisms showed an increase in proteolysis with time. the variations in proteolytic capabilities translated into corresponding variations in ace inhibitory potential of these organisms. bifidobacterium longum 5022 showed the highest ace inhibitory potential followed by l. delbrueckii ssp.  bulgaricus 1368, l. casei 15286, s. thermophilus 1275, and l. acidophilus 4461. organisms with high intracellular enzymatic activities grew well. also, aminopeptidases of strains of l. acidophilus 4461 and s. thermophilus 1275 that could better utilize proline containing substrates showed enhanced ace inhibitory potential. lactic acid bacteria possessed the ability to inhibit alpha-glu activity, which endowed them an antidiabetic property as well.

TI  == sensitivity of capsular-producing streptococcus thermophilus strains to bacteriophage adsorption.
AB  == aims: to determine whether the presence and type of exopolysaccharides (eps), slime-eps or capsular, and the structural characteristics of the polymers produced by streptococcus thermophilus strains could interfere with or be involved in phage adsorption. methods and results: phage-host interactions between eight eps-producing strep. thermophilus strains (crl419, 638, 804, 810, 815, 817, 821, 1190) and five streptococcus specific phages (phiysca, phi3, phi5, phi6, phi8) isolated from argentinean faulty fermentation failed yoghurts were evaluated. no relationship was found between the eps chemical composition and the phage sensitivity/resistance phenotype. in general, the capsular-producing strains were more sensitive to phage attacks than the noncapsular-producing strains. streptococcus thermophilus crl1190 (capsular-producing) was the only strain sensitive to all bacteriophages and showed the highest efficiency of plating. phage adsorption to a capsular-negative, eps low-producing mutant of strain crl1190 was reduced, especially for phiycsa and phi8. conclusions: the presence of capsular polysaccharide surrounding the cells of strep. thermophilus  strains could play a role in the adsorption of specific phages to the cells. significance and impact of the study: capsular-producing strep. thermophilus strains should be evaluated for their bacteriophage sensitivity if they are included in starter cultures for the fermented food industry.

TI  == effect of using propionic acid bacteria as an adjunct culture in yogurt production.
AB  == propionibacteria are able to produce a wide variety of food components beneficial to human health. in this study, yogurt was produced by using the adjunct starter  cultures propionibacterium jensenii b1264 and propionibacterium thoenii (jensenii) p126. although the total solids and protein contents of the yogurts did not show any significant differences, titratable acidity of the control sample (yc-380) remained lower than that of propionibacterium spp.-supplemented yogurts during 15 d of storage. the yogurts produced by yc-380 + p126 cultures had the firmest structure (0.26 n). the highest acetaldehyde (29.35 mg/kg) content was obtained with yogurt made with yc-380 + p126 + b1264 on d 1. the addition of propionibacteria to yogurt did not have any negative effect on the counts of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in yogurt. during the first week of storage, propionibacteria counts remained high, suggesting that yogurt provided a good environment for these organisms. this new product would provide not only beneficial health effects, but also a new alternative product to plain set-type yogurt.

TI  == whey starter for grana padano cheese: effect of technological parameters on viability and composition of the microbial community.
AB  == this work aimed to investigate the effects of thermal treatments and yeast extract addition on the composition of the microbial community of natural whey starters for grana padano cheese. different natural whey starter samples were held at 4 degrees c for 24 h (cooling treatment), or at -20 degrees c for 24 h (freezing treatment) to evaluate the possibility of conservation, or at 54 degrees c for 1 h (heat treatment) to evaluate the effect of the temperature commonly used during curd cooking. separately, another set of samples was enriched with 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0% (wt/vol) of yeast extract to study its effect on the growth of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the starter. the new approach in this study is the use of 2 culture-independent methods: length heterogeneity (lh)-reverse transcription (rt)-pcr and fluorescence microscopy. these techniques allowed us to easily, quickly, and reproducibly assess metabolically active lab in the control and treated samples. the lh-rt-pcr technique distinguished microorganisms based on natural variations in the length of 16s rrna amplified by rt-pcr, as analyzed by using an automatic gene sequencer. fluorescence microscopy counts were performed by using a live/dead baclight bacterial viability kit. the  repeatability of lh-rt-pcr showed that this technique has great potential to reveal changes in the microbial community of natural whey starters for grana padano cheese. all species showed low sensitivity to cold (4 degrees c). however, after the freezing (-20 degrees c) and heating (54 degrees c) treatments, different behaviors of the species were reported, with significant changes in their viability and relative composition. heating treatment during curd cooking profoundly affected the viability and composition of the community that remained  in the cheese and that consequently modified the microbial population. at the same time, this treatment produced the selection of lab in whey and could be considered as the first step in natural whey starter production. addition of yeast extract stimulated the growth of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis to the detriment of lactobacillus helveticus species. because the yeast extract altered the microflora balance, whey starter conservation at -20 degrees c and yeast extract addition cannot be suggested as technological innovations.

TI  == effect of wild strains used as starter cultures and adjunct cultures on the volatile compounds of the pecorino siciliano cheese.
AB  == the effect of six wild strains on the volatile profile of the ps cheese was investigated and compared to that generated from industrial starters generally used to produce ps cheese. all cheeses were subjected to microbiological, physicochemical, and volatile compounds analyses. the dgge of the 16s rdna analysis was also applied. the volatile compounds generated during ripening were  studied through the spme and the gc-ms methods. no difference was detected between the experimental and control cheeses throughout chemical and microbiological analyses, while the dgge results showed the presence of streptococcus thermophilus in all cheeses, and the dominance of enterococcus durans, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus casei in most of the experimental cheeses. moreover, the presence of lactococcus lactis species as in  the control and in the experimental p2 and p4 cheeses was also revealed. the spme results showed more pronounced volatile compounds in the experimental cheese samples than in the control ones.

TI  == [gene regulation to lactic acid bacteria for increasing production of flavor metabolite].
AB  == abstract: the major flavor substances lactic acid bacteria produced include the buttermilk aroma butanedione, the yoghurt flavor acetaldehyde and the amino acid. metabolic engineering in lab had focused primarily on rerouting of pyruvate metabolism towards butanedione or acetaldehyde to improve the flavor of fermented milk, which has considerable economic value. the typical yogurt flavor is caused  by acetaldehyde produced through many different pathways. the attention was focused on one specific reaction for acetaldehyde formation catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which encoded by the glya gene. in addition, the efficient conversion of glucose into acetaldehyde was achieved by over-expression of pyruvate decarboxylase and nadh oxidase in lab. the concentration of acetaldehyde derived from this regulation is higher than the other strategy. as for the regulation of butanedione, it was focused on combinating inactivation of  alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase with low lactate dehydrogenase activity, or with overproduction of nadh-oxidase, or with overproduction of alpha-acetolactate synthase. then the possibility of co-regulation with certain three kinds of enzyme above was recommended.

TI  == influence of microorganisms on retinol isomerization in milk.
AB  == in order to have a deeper insight into the retinol isomerization phenomenon, in this work different milk samples have been analysed for their content of trans retinol and its cis-isomers, by means of reliable hplc techniques. levels of the  different isomers and the degree of retinol isomerization (13-cis/all-trans ratio, %) have been monitored during milk storage at different temperatures and after addition of specific microorganisms. in raw milk stored at 4 degrees c for  96 h the degree of retinol isomerization shifted from 1.1 to 2.3%, while in raw milk stored at 22 degrees c for 24 h it increased from 1.1 to 12.7%. among microorganisms tested in pasteurized milk, the most active in causing an increment in the 13-cis/all-trans ratio (%), from 3.4 to 33.4% in 8 h, was streptococcus thermophilus. the results obtained demonstrated a relationship between microbial evolution and retinol isomerization. therefore, the determination of retinol isomers is of importance not only for a more precise evaluation of vitamin a activity but also for the evaluation of the microbiological quality of milk.

TI  == yogurt containing probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 helps resolve moderate diarrhea and increases cd4 count in hiv/aids patients.
AB  == hiv/aids is changing the human landscape in sub-saharan africa. relatively few patients receive antiretroviral therapy, and many suffer from debilitating diarrhea that affects their quality of life. given the track record of probiotics to alleviate diarrhea, conventional yogurt fermented with lactobacillus delbruekii var bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus was supplemented with probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14. twenty-four hiv/aids adult female patients (18 to 44 y) with clinical signs of moderate diarrhea, cd4  counts over 200, and not receiving antiretrovirals or dietary supplements, consumed either 100 ml supplemented or unsupplemented yogurt per day for 15 days. hematologic profiles, cd4 cell counts, and quality of life was evaluated at baseline, 15 and 30 days postprobiotic-yogurt feeding. there was no significant alteration in the hematologic parameters of both groups before and after the probiotic-yogurt feeding. the probiotic yogurt group at baseline, 15 and 30 days  had a mean wbc count of 5.8+/-0.76 x 10(9)/l, 6.0+/-1.02 x 10(9)/l, and 5.4+/-0.14 x 10(9)/l, respectively. however, the mean cd4 cell count remained the same or increased at 15 and 30 days in 11/12 probiotic-treated subjects compared  to 3/12 in the control. diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea resolved in 12/12 probiotic-treated subjects within 2 days, compared to 2/12 receiving yogurt for 15 days. this is the first study to show the benefits of probiotic yogurt on quality of life of women in nigeria with hiv/aids, and suggests that perhaps a simple fermented food can provide some relief in the management of the aids epidemic in africa.

TI  == probiotic crescenza cheese containing lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus manufactured with high-pressure homogenized milk.
AB  == high-pressure homogenization (hph) is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional thermal treatment of food preservation and diversification. its effectiveness on the deactivation of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in model systems and real food is well documented. to evaluate the potential of milk treated by hph for the production of crescenza cheese with commercial probiotic lactobacilli added, 4 types of cheeses were made: hph (from hph-treated milk), p  (from pasteurized milk), hph-p (hph-treated milk plus probiotics), and p-p (pasteurized milk plus probiotics) cheeses. a strain of streptococcus thermophilus was used as starter culture for cheese production. compositional, microbiological, physicochemical, and organoleptic analyses were carried out at 1, 5, 8, and 12 d of refrigerated storage (4 degrees c). according to results obtained, no significant differences among the 4 cheese types were observed for gross composition (protein, fat, moisture) and ph. differently, the hph treatment of milk increased the cheese yield about 1% and positively affected the viability during the refrigerated storage of the probiotic bacteria. in fact, after 12 d of storage, the lactobacillus paracasei a13 cell loads were 8 log cfu/ g, whereas lactobacillus acidophilus h5 exhibited, in p-p cheese, a cell load decrease of about 1 log cfu/g with respect to the hph-p cheese. the hyperbaric treatment had  a significant positive effect on free fatty acids release and cheese proteolysis. also, probiotic cultures affected proteolytic and lipolytic cheese patterns. no significant differences were found for the sensory descriptors salty and creamy among hph and p cheeses as well as for acid, piquant, sweet, milky, salty, creamy, and overall acceptance among hph, hph-p, and p-p crescenza cheeses.

TI  == molecular analysis of yogurt containing lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus in human intestinal microbiota.
AB  == background: yogurt has traditionally been considered a probiotic-carrier food with health-promoting effects. despite the universal assumption of this assertion, several researchers have evaluated the real capability of the yogurt bacteria lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus to survive and proliferate in the human intestine and have found contradictory results. objective: this double-blind crossover study assessed the  qualitative and quantitative effects of fresh and heat-treated yogurt on bacterial intestinal microbiota from healthy subjects. design: the subjects were  divided into experimental (n=63) and control (n=16) groups. the experimental group consumed fresh and heat-treated yogurt for 15 d according to a crossover design with a washout period of 2 wk. three different fecal samples per individual were recovered: at baseline, after fresh yogurt intake, and after heat-treated yogurt intake. qualitative changes in microbiota were studied by denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (dgge) with universal and lactic acid bacteria (lab) 16s-rrna primers. quantitative changes in lab, clostridium coccoides, clostridium perfringens, and bacteroides groups were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a particular dgge stable band pattern was observed in each sample. no significant qualitative differences were  detected in any fecal sample. however, a significantly higher density of lab and  c. perfringens and a significant decrease in the density of bacteroides was observed after consumption of both types of yogurt. microbiota density was not significantly different between the fresh and heat-treated yogurt groups, except  for lab, which was significantly greater in the fresh yogurt group. conclusion: the main change in human microbiota observed after yogurt consumption was an increase in the density of lab and c. perfringens to the detriment of bacteroides. bacterial changes were not different after the consumption of fresh  and heat-treated yogurt.

TI  == the inhibitory spectrum of thermophilin 9 from streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9 depends on the production of multiple peptides and the activity of blpg(st), a thiol-disulfide oxidase.
AB  == the blp(st) cluster of streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9 was recently shown to contain all the genetic information required for the production of bacteriocins active against other s. thermophilus strains. in this study, we further investigated the antimicrobial activity of s. thermophilus lmd-9 by testing the susceptibility of 31 bacterial species (87 strains). we showed that lmd-9 displays an inhibitory spectrum targeted toward related gram-positive bacteria, including pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes. using deletion mutants, we investigated the contribution of the three putative bacteriocin-encoding operons  blpd(st)-orf2, blpu(st)-orf3, and blpe(st)-blpf(st) (bac(st) operons) and of the  blpg(st) gene, which encodes a putative modification protein, to the inhibitory spectrum and immunity of strain lmd-9. our results present evidence that the blp(st) locus encodes a multipeptide bacteriocin system called thermophilin 9. among the four class ii bacteriocin-like peptides encoded within the bac(st) operons, blpd(st) alone was sufficient to inhibit the growth of most thermophilin 9-sensitive species. the blpd(st) gene forms an operon with its associated immunity gene(s), and this functional bacteriocin/immunity module could easily be transferred to lactococcus lactis. the remaining three bac(st) peptides, blpu(st), blpe(st), and blpf(st), confer poor antimicrobial activity but act as enhancers of the antagonistic activity of thermophilin 9 by an unknown mechanism. the blpg(st) gene was also shown to be specifically required for the antilisteria activity of thermophilin 9, since its deletion abolished the sensitivities of most listeria species. by complementation of the motility deficiency of escherichia coli dsba, we showed that blpg(st) encodes a functional thiol-disulfide oxidase, suggesting an important role for disulfide bridges within thermophilin 9.

TI  == synbiotic synthesis of oligosaccharides during milk fermentation by addition of leuconostoc starter and sugars.
AB  == synthesis of oligosaccharides during milk fermentation was attempted by inoculating leuconostoc citreum with lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus as starters. dextransucrase of ln. citreum worked as a catalyst for the transglycosylation reaction of sugars; sucrose was added as the glucose donor, and lactose or maltose acted as the acceptor compound for the reaction. when 4% sucrose was added in milk, glucosyl-lactose was synthesized (about 1%, w/v) after 1-2 days of fermentation at 15 or 25 degrees c. alternatively, when sucrose and maltose (2% each, w/v) were added, panose (about 1%, w/v) and other isomaltooligosaccharides were made in a day at 15-35 degrees c. growth patterns of lactobacilli and streptococci starters were not affected by the coculture of leuconostoc starter, but the rate  of acid synthesis was slightly slowed at every temperature. addition of sugars in milk did not give any adverse effect on the lactate fermentation. accordingly, the use of leuconostoc starter and addition of sugars in milk allowed the production of oligosaccharides-containing fermented milk, and application of this method will facilitate the extensive development of synbiotic lactate foods.

TI  == phage response to crispr-encoded resistance in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr) and their associated genes are linked to a mechanism of acquired resistance against bacteriophages. bacteria can integrate short stretches of phage-derived sequences (spacers) within crispr loci to become phage resistant. in this study, we further characterized the efficiency of crispr1 as a phage resistance mechanism in streptococcus thermophilus. first, we show that crispr1 is distinct from previously known phage defense systems and is effective against the two main groups of s. thermophilus phages. analyses of 30 bacteriophage-insensitive mutants of s. thermophilus indicate that the addition of one new spacer in crispr1 is the most frequent outcome of a phage challenge and that the iterative  addition of spacers increases the overall phage resistance of the host. the added new spacers have a size of between 29 to 31 nucleotides, with 30 being by far the most frequent. comparative analysis of 39 newly acquired spacers with the complete genomic sequences of the wild-type phages 2972, 858, and dt1 demonstrated that the newly added spacer must be identical to a region (named proto-spacer) in the phage genome to confer a phage resistance phenotype. moreover, we found a crispr1-specific sequence (nnagaaw) located downstream of the proto-spacer region that is important for the phage resistance phenotype. finally, we show through the analyses of 20 mutant phages that virulent phages are rapidly evolving through single nucleotide mutations as well as deletions, in response to crispr1.

TI  == diversity, activity, and evolution of crispr loci in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr) are hypervariable loci widely distributed in prokaryotes that provide acquired immunity against foreign genetic elements. here, we characterize a novel streptococcus thermophilus locus, crispr3, and experimentally demonstrate its ability to integrate novel spacers in response to bacteriophage. also, we analyze crispr diversity and activity across three distinct crispr loci in several s. thermophilus strains. we show that both crispr repeats and cas genes are locus specific and functionally coupled. a total of 124 strains were studied, and 109 unique spacer arrangements were observed across the three crispr loci. overall, 3,626 spacers were analyzed, including 2,829 for crispr1 (782 unique), 173 for crispr2 (16 unique), and 624 for crispr3 (154 unique). sequence analysis of the spacers revealed homology and identity to phage sequences (77%), plasmid sequences (16%), and s. thermophilus chromosomal sequences (7%). polymorphisms were observed for the crispr repeats, crispr spacers, cas genes, crispr motif, locus architecture, and specific sequence content. interestingly, crispr loci evolved both via polarized addition of novel spacers after exposure to foreign genetic elements and via internal deletion of spacers. we hypothesize that the level of diversity is correlated with relative crispr activity and propose that the activity is highest for crispr1, followed by crispr3, while crispr2 may be degenerate. globally, the dynamic nature of crispr loci might prove valuable for  typing and comparative analyses of strains and microbial populations. also, crisprs provide critical insights into the relationships between prokaryotes and  their environments, notably the coevolution of host and viral genomes.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria from retail fermented foods.
AB  == one important safety criterion of using lactic acid bacteria (lab) in food applications is to ensure that they do not carry transferable antimicrobial resistance (ar) determinants. in this study, 63 lab belonging to six genera, streptococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus, enterococcus, leuconostoc, and pediococcus, were recovered from 28 retail fermented food products in maryland, identified to species with 16s-23s rrna spacer pcrs, and characterized for antimicrobial susceptibility against eight antimicrobials. besides intrinsic resistance to ciprofloxacin or vancomycin in some lactobacilli, tetracycline resistance was observed in two streptococcus thermophilus isolates from one cheese and one sour cream sample and was associated with the presence of a nonconjugative tet(s) gene. the results indicated a low level of ar among naturally occurring and starter lab cultures in fermented dairy and meat products in the united states; therefore, the probability for foodborne lab to serve as reservoirs of ar is low. further studies involving a larger sample size are needed to assess the potential risk of ar gene transfer from lab in fermented food products.

TI  == effects of fructooligosaccharide and whey protein concentrate on the viability of starter culture in reduced-fat probiotic yogurt during storage.
AB  == viability of yogurt starter cultures and bifidobacterium animalis was assessed during 28 d storage in reduced-fat yogurts containing 1.5% milk fat supplemented  with 1.5% fructooligosaccharide or whey protein concentrate. these properties were examined in comparison with control yogurts containing 1.5% and 3% milk fat  and no supplement. although fructooligosaccharide improved the viability of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus, and bifidobacterium animalis, the highest growth was obtained when milk was supplemented with whey protein concentrate in reduced-fat yogurt (p < 0.05). supplementation with 1.5% whey protein concentrate in reduced-fat yogurt increased the viable counts of s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus,  and b. animalis by 1 log cycle in the 1st week of storage when compared to control sample. similar improvement in the growth of both yogurt bacteria and b.  animalis was also obtained in the full-fat yogurt containing 3% milk fat and no supplement. addition of whey protein concentrate also resulted in the highest content of lactic and acetic acids (p < 0.05). a gradual increase was obtained in organic acid contents during the storage.

TI  == urease production by streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == in order to identify potential alternative sources of urease for the removal of urea from alcoholic beverages, 205 strains of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 27 different species were screened for urease production. only streptococcus thermophilus produced urease. cell permeabilization with toluene allowed to increase activity significantly. optimal ph for urease activity in whole and permeabilized cells and of cell free extracts differed slightly, but was in the range 6.0-7.0. significant activity was retained at ph 3.0 and 8.0, and, for cell free extracts, at ph 4.0 in the presence of ethanol. urease production was evaluated in fermentations with ph control (5.25-6.5) and without ph control. very little urease was produced in absence of urea, which at 5g/l slowed growth significantly in fermentations without ph control, but prevented a decrease in ph below 5.1 and resulted in higher final biomass. optimal ph for growth was between 6.0 and 6.5 but specific urease activity was higher for fermentations at low ph at the beginning of the exponential phase. however, a higher total urease activity was obtained at ph 6.0 and 6.5 because of higher biomass. potential technological applications of urease production by s. thermophilus are discussed.

TI  == effect of a probiotic mixed culture on texture profile and sensory performance of minas fresh cheese in comparison with the traditional products.
AB  == the effect of a mixed probiotic culture on instrumental texture, and on sensorial and related properties of minas fresh cheese during refrigerated storage was investigated. three cheese-making trials were prepared: t1, with the traditional  type o starter culture (lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis + l. lactis subsp. cremoris), t2 with only lactic acid and t3, with lactic acid and the probiotic abt culture (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 + bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 + streptococcus thermophilus). instrumental texture profile analysis and related properties were monitored during storage for up to 21 days. lb. acidophilus and b. animalis were present in high levels throughout storage of cheeses t3, above 6 log cfu.g(-1), threshold required for probiotic activity, and stimulation of the  la-5 growth was observed. cheeses with added probiotic abt culture, as well as those made adding lactic acid only, showed to be less brittle and with more favorable sensorial features, due to higher ph values. results indicated that the use of probiotic abt culture complementary to lactic acid for the purpose of substituting the type o (lc. lactis subsp. lactis + lc. lactis subsp. cremoris) culture, traditionally employed for minas cheese production, is advantageous.

TI  == a genome-wide survey of short coding sequences in streptococci.
AB  == identification of short genes that encode peptides of fewer than 60 aa is challenging, both experimentally and in silico. as a consequence, the universe of these short coding sequences (cdss) remains largely unknown, although some are acknowledged to play important roles in cell-cell communication, particularly in  gram-positive bacteria. this paper reports a thorough search for short cdss across streptococcal genomes. our bioinformatic approach relied on a combination  of advanced intrinsic and extrinsic methods. in the first step, intrinsic sequence information (nucleotide composition and presence of rbss) served to identify new short putative cdss (spcdss) and to eliminate the differences between annotation policies. in the second step, pseudogene fragments and false predictions were filtered out. the last step consisted of screening the remaining spcdss for lines of extrinsic evidence involving sequence and gene-context comparisons. a total of 789 spcdss across 20 complete genomes (19 streptococcus and one enterococcus) received the support of at least one line of extrinsic evidence, which corresponds to an average of 20 short cdss per million base pairs. most of these had no known function, and a significant fraction (31%) are  not even annotated as hypothetical genes in genbank records. as an illustration of the value of this list, we describe a new family of cdss, encoding very short  hydrophobic peptides (20-23 aa) situated just upstream of some of the positive transcriptional regulators of the rgg family. the expression of seven other short cdss from streptococcus thermophilus cnrz1066 that encode peptides ranging in length from 41 to 56 aa was confirmed by real-time quantitative rt-pcr and revealed a variety of expression patterns. finally, one peptide from this list, encoded by a gene that is not annotated in genbank, was identified in a cell-envelope-enriched fraction of s. thermophilus cnrz1066.

TI  == heat- and formalin-inactivated probiotic bacteria induce comparable cytokine patterns in intestinal epithelial cell-leucocyte cocultures.
AB  == the mode of inactivation of probiotic bacteria may profoundly affect their immune-modulatory properties to the point of reversal of effects in in vitro human intestinal epithelial-like cell cultures (caco-2). to further investigate the influence of inactivation treatment on cytokine production, three probiotic strains were evaluated-live, heat-inactivated, and formalin-inactivated strains-for their impact on interleukin (il) 6, il-8, and il-10 production in caco-2-leucocyte cocultures. the tested bacteria induced strain-specific production of il-6, il-8, and il-10. no suppressive effects on cytokine synthesis were observed. live microorganisms seemed to be slightly more potent inducers of  cytokine production than nonviable strains, but differences to inactivated bacteria were not statistically significant. our results indicate that heat and formalin treatments of probiotic microorganisms are equivalent inactivation methods in terms of induction of il-6, il-8, and il-10 production in caco-2-peripheral blood mononuclear cell cocultures and do not invert immune-modulatory effects.

TI  == characterization of proteins belonging to the chap-related superfamily within the firmicutes.
AB  == cell division is a dynamic process ending by separation of the daughter cells. this final step requires the cleavage of the murein septum synthetized during cell division. in streptococcus thermophilus, cse plays an important role in cell separation. cse protein contains, at its n-terminal end, a signal peptide and a putative lysm motif suggesting that it is secreted and able to bind to the cell wall. furthermore, the c-terminus of cse carries a putative cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases (chap) domain conferring to the protein a potential catalytic activity. to gain insight into the role of cse in the cell division process, in silico analysis of the firmicutes proteins displaying chap-related domain was undertaken. this work allowed us to distinguish and characterize within the firmicutes the 2 families of proteins (chap and nlpc/p60) belonging to the chap superfamily. these 2 families regroup mainly peptidoglycan hydrolases. data from the literature indicate that nlpc/p60  and chap proteins cleave distinct peptidoglycan bonds. among the enzymes characterized within the firmicutes, nlpc/p60 proteins are gamma-d-glutamate-meso-diaminopimelate muropeptidase. instead, chap enzymes involved in cell separation are n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase and chap lysins have endopeptidase activity.

TI  == regulation of excision of integrative and potentially conjugative elements from streptococcus thermophilus: role of the arp1 repressor.
AB  == the integrative and conjugative elements (ices) excise by site-specific recombination between attl and attr flanking sites, self-transfer the resulting circular form and integrate into the genome of the recipient cell. two putative ices, icest1 and icest3, are integrated in the same locus in 2 strains of streptococcusthermophilus. icest1 is a composite element harbouring an internal recombination site, attl'. the recombination between attl' and attr leads to the  excision of a shorter putative ice, icest2. icest1/icest2 and icest3 carry related regulation modules sharing the open reading frame arp1 that encodes a protein related to the ci repressor of the phage lambda. the repressors belonging to this family autoproteolyse in the presence of damaged dna. treatments with mitomycin c induce an increase in the excision of icest1, icest2 and icest3. furthermore, the arp1 deletion leads to a 1,000-fold increase in the excision of  icest1 and icest2 and to a decrease in the excision induction by mitomycin c. thus, all together, these results suggest that the autocleavage of the arp1 repressor is involved in derepression of the s. thermophilus putative ice excision by mitomycin c.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == impact of lactic acid bacteria on oxidative dna damage in human derived colon cells.
AB  == it is assumed that reactive oxygen species (ros) play a key role in inflammatory  bowel diseases and colon cancer and a number of studies indicate that lactic acid bacteria (lab) possess antioxidant properties and may prevent these diseases. in  the present study, we developed a model which allowed us to investigate the prevention of oxidative dna damage in human derived colon (ht29) cells by lab. furthermore, we investigated if these effects correlate with superoxide (o2(-)) resistance of the strains. the protective properties of 55 strains were monitored in single cell gel electrophoresis (scge) assays. after preincubation of the cells with lab (60 min), oxidative damage was induced by exposure to plumbagin (5.0 microm, 120 min) which releases o2(-) or by hydrogen peroxide (50 microm, 10 min); o2(-) resistance was monitored in plate growth inhibition assays. 25 strains (45%) reduced plumbagin induced dna migration while only few of them (20%) were protective towards hydrogen peroxide induced damage. the strongest effects (up to 60% reduction of o2(-) induced dna migration) were observed with representatives of the species streptococcus thermophilus. the prevention of dna  damage in the colon cells by the bacteria did not correlate with their o2(-) resistance. additional experiments indicate that the reduction of oxidative damage is only seen with viable bacteria but not with heat inactivated cells and  that it takes also place when the colon cells are separated from the lab by permeable filter membranes indicating that the bacteria release ros protective factors into the medium. dose response experiments showed that the protection depends on the concentration of the bacteria; significant effects were observed with titers 3 x 10(6-7)cells/ml. unexpectedly, we found that a substantial fraction of the strains (13%) induced dna damage in untreated cells, some of them increased also the effects of the ros generating chemicals. preliminary experiments with tetramethylbenzidine (tmb) agar indicate that this phenomenon may be due to release of hydrogen peroxide by the bacteria. overall, our study shows that the impact of lab on dna damage in human derived colon cells is ambivalent; while the majority of strains was protective against oxidative damage some of them induced per se pronounced dna migration. since the effects were seen with bacterial concentrations which may be reached in the intestinal tract after  consumption of fermented milk products, it is likely that the effects we observed in the present study are relevant for humans.

AB  == aims: colonic metabolism of lactose may play a role in lactose intolerance. we investigated whether a 2-week supplementation of bifidobacterium longum (in capsules) and a yogurt enriched with bifidobacterium animalis could modify the composition and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota in 11 chinese lactose-intolerant subjects. methods and results: the numbers of total cells, total bacteria and the eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group in faeces  as measured with fluorescent in situ hybridization and the faecal beta-galactosidase activity increased significantly during supplementation. the number of bifidobacterium showed a tendency to increase during and after supplementation. with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, in subjects in which b. animalis and b. longum were not detected before supplementation, both strains were present in faeces during supplementation, but disappeared after supplementation. the degree of lactose digestion in the small intestine and the oro-caecal transit time were not different before and after supplementation, whereas symptom scores after lactose challenge decreased after supplementation. conclusions: the results suggest that supplementation modifies the amount and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota and alleviates symptoms in lactose-intolerant subjects. the changes in the colonic microbiota might be among the factors modified by the supplementation which lead to the alleviation of lactose intolerance. significance and impact of the study: this study provides evidence for the possibility of managing lactose intolerance with dietary lactose (yogurt) and probiotics via modulating the colonic microbiota.

TI  == control of the transcription of a short gene encoding a cyclic peptide in streptococcus thermophilus: a new quorum-sensing system?
AB  == gram-positive bacteria secrete a variety of peptides that are often subjected to  posttranslational modifications and that are either antimicrobials or pheromones  involved in bacterial communication. our objective was to identify peptides secreted by streptococcus thermophilus, a nonpathogenic bacterium widely used in  dairy technology in association with other bacteria, and to understand their potential roles in cell-cell communication. using reverse-phase liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and edman sequencing, we analyzed the culture  supernatants of three s. thermophilus strains (cnrz1066, lmg18311, and lmd-9) grown in a medium containing no peptides. we identified several peptides in the culture supernatants, some of them found with the three strains while others were specific to the lmd-9 strain. we focused our study on a new modified peptide secreted by s. thermophilus lmd-9 and designated pep1357c. this peptide contains  9 amino acids and lost 2 da in a posttranslational modification, most probably a  dehydrogenation, leading to a linkage between the lys2 and trp6 residues. production of pep1357c and transcription of its encoding gene depend on both the  medium composition and the growth phase. furthermore, we demonstrated that transcription of the gene coding for pep1357c is drastically decreased in mutants inactivated for the synthesis of a short hydrophobic peptide, a transcriptional regulator, or the oligopeptide transport system. taken together, our results led  us to deduce that the transcription of the pep1357c-encoding gene is controlled by a new quorum-sensing system.

TI  == inhibition of bacteriophage replication in streptococcus thermophilus by subunit  poisoning of primase.
AB  == invariant and highly conserved amino acids within a primase consensus sequence were targeted by site-specific mutations within the putative primase of streptococcus thermophilus phage kappa3. pcr products containing the desired mutation(s) within putative atpase/helicase and/or oligomerization domains of the kappa3-encoded primase gene were cloned into a high-copy-number vector and expressed in s. thermophilus nck1125. the majority of the plasmid constructs failed to alter phage sensitivity; however, four of the constructs conferred strong phage resistance upon the host. expression of the k238(a/t) and rr340-341aa mutant proteins in trans suppressed the function of the native phage  primase protein in a dominant negative fashion via a proposed subunit poisoning mechanism. these constructs completely inhibited phage genome synthesis and reduced the efficiencies of plaquing and centre of infection formation by more than 9 and 3.5 logs, respectively. amber mutations introduced upstream of the transdominant rr340-341aa and k238(a/t) mutations restored phage genome replication and sensitivity of the host, indicating that translation was required to confer phage resistance. introduction of an e437a mutation in a putative oligomerization domain located downstream of the transdominant k238t mutation also completely suppressed phage resistance. this study appears to represent the  first use of transdominant proteins to inhibit phages that are disruptive to cultures used in industrial fermentations.

TI  == the effect of daily consumption of probiotic and conventional yoghurt on oxidant  and anti-oxidant parameters in plasma of young healthy women.
AB  == in recent years there has been increasing interest in the potential beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria, particularly concerning their immune-modulating effects. considering the involvement of free radicals in immunological processes, we tried to verify and compare the effects of probiotic (lactobacillus casei) and conventional yoghurt on antioxidant and oxidant parameters in plasma of humans. in this study female volunteers consumed 100 g/day of probiotic (n = 17) or conventional yoghurt (n = 16) for two weeks (t1-t2) and 200 g/day for another two weeks (t2-t3). a wash-out phase lasting two weeks followed. total antioxidant capacity (tac), albumin, and bilirubin were determined photometrically, uric acid was determined by enzymatic methods, and vitamin e, carotenoids, malondialdehyde  (mda), and conjugated dienes (cd) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). in the period of continuous yoghurt intake (t1-t3), mean concentrations of the antioxidants vitamin e, lycopene, and zeaxanthin decreased  significantly (p < 0.01) in the probiotic and in the control group. the average concentrations of lutein, beta-carotene, albumin, uric acid, and bilirubin decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the probiotic group, only. these alterations led to a significant (p < 0.001) decrease of the average tac values during the period t1-t3 in both tested groups. in the interval of daily yoghurt consumption (t1-t3) the mean plasma levels of oxidant parameters mda and cd increased significantly in the probiotic (mda: p < 0.01; cd: p < 0.001) and the control group (cd: p < 0.01). the average activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (sod) was quite constant throughout the study in both groups. the mean activities of gsh-px and catalase decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in the probiotic group, only after consuming yoghurt daily for four weeks  (t1-t3). although several parameters changed significantly during the study, no significant differences were observed between both investigated groups. therefore, the results indicate a possible influence of both probiotic and conventional yoghurt on the plasma levels of antioxidant and oxidant parameters.

TI  == safety assessment of dairy microorganisms: the lactobacillus genus.
AB  == lactobacilli are gram positive rods belonging to the lactic acid bacteria (lab) group. their phenotypic traits, such as each species' obligate/facultative, homo/heterofermentation abilities play a crucial role in souring raw milk and in  the production of fermented dairy products such as cheese, yoghurt and fermented  milk (including probiotics). an up to date safety analysis of these lactobacilli  is needed to ensure consumer safety. lactobacillus genus is a heterogeneous microbial group containing some 135 species and 27 subspecies, whose classification is constantly being reshuffled. with the recent use of advanced molecular methods it has been suggested that the extreme diversity of the lactobacillus genomes would justify recognition of new subgeneric divisions. a combination of genotypic and phenotypic tests, for example dna-based techniques and conventional carbohydrate tests, is required to determine species. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) has been successfully applied to strains  of dairy origin and is the most discriminatory and reproducible method for differentiating lactobacillus strains. the bibliographical data support the hypothesis that the ingestion of lactobacillus is not at all hazardous since lactobacillemia induced by food, particularly fermented dairy products, is extremely rare and only occurs in predisposed patients. some metabolic features such as the possible production of biogenic amines in fermented products could generate undesirable adverse effects. a minority of starter and adjunct cultures  and probiotic lactobacillus strains may exceptionally show transferable antibiotic resistance. however, this may be underestimated as transferability studies are not systematic. we consider that transferable antibiotic resistance is the only relevant cause for caution and justifies performing antibiotic-susceptibility assays as these strains have the potential to serve as  hosts of antibiotic-resistance genes, with the risk of transferring these genes to other bacteria. however, as a general rule, lactobacilli have a high natural resistance to many antibiotics, especially vancomycin, that is not transferable.  safety assessment requirements for lactobacillus strains of technological interest should be limited to an antibiotic profile and a study to determine whether any antibiotic resistance(s) of medical interest detected is (or are) transferable. this agrees with the recent efsa proposal suggesting attribution of a qps status for 32 selected species of lactobacilli.

AB  == rapid identification of bacteria by a bioinformatics-based approach, which processes the mass spectra observed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (maldi-ms), relies on the calculated masses of ribosomal subunit proteins as biomarkers predicted from amino acid sequences found in protein sequence databases. to verify the actual state of the  registered sequence information, a simple intact protein analysis by maldi-ms using cell lysates as samples was applied to the characterization of ribosomal proteins from genome-sequenced streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains. this method avoided the risk of loss of some subunit proteins and the formation of disulfide bonds during the purification of ribosomal proteins. by comparing this with the maldi mass spectra of different strains and carrying out manual inspection of sequence information,  a total of five errors in n-terminal amino acid sequences were identified. after  sequence correction, approximately 40 out of 53 subunit proteins could be assigned, considering n-terminal methionine loss only as a post-translational modification. these show promise for use as practical biomarkers for the rapid identification of s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus. after verification of these  amino acid sequences, mass differences relative to those of genome-sequenced strains have the potential for distinguishing bacteria at the strain level.

AB  == ragusano cheese is a "protected denomination of origin" cheese made in the hyblean region of sicily from raw milk using traditional wooden tools, without starter. to explore the ragusano bacterial ecosystem, molecular fingerprinting was conducted at different times during the ripening and biofilms from the wooden vats called "tinas" were investigated. raw milks collected at two farm sites, one on the mountain and one at sea level, were processed to produce ragusano cheese.  raw milk, curd before and after cooking, curd at stretching time (cheese 0 time), and cheese samples (4 and 7 months) were analyzed by pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge) and by classical enumeration microbiology. with the use of universal primers, pcr-ttge revealed many differences between the raw milk profiles, but also notable common bands identified as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and enterococcus faecium. after  the stretching, ttge profiles revealed three to five dominant species only through the entire process of ripening. in the biofilms of the two tinas used, one to five species were detected, s. thermophilus being predominant in both. biofilms from five other tinas were also analyzed by pcr-ttge, pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis, specific pcr tests, and sequencing, confirming the  predominance of lactic acid bacteria (s. thermophilus, l. lactis, and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and the presence of a few high-gc-content species, like coryneform bacteria. the spontaneous acidification of raw milks before and after contact with the five tinas was followed in two independent experiments. the lag period before acidification can be up to 5 h, depending on the raw milk and the specific tina, highlighting the complexity of this natural inoculation system.

TI  == identification and characterization of starter lactic acid bacteria and probiotics from columbian dairy products.
AB  == aims: considering the significant rise in the probiotic market in columbia, and given the lack of reports concerning the microbial population and strain performance in products from different producers, this study aims at determining  the number of viable starter bacteria and probiotics in bio-yoghurts available at the columbian market, identifying the species and analysing the performance of the isolated strains in bile acid resistance, antagonistic activity against pathogens, and adherence capacity to human intestinal epithelial cells. methods and results: seven bio-yoghurts were analysed for the bacterial species present.  species identification was carried out using 16s rrna gene targeted pcr. the cultured bacteria were tested for bile acid resistance, adherence to a human intestinal epithelial cell line, and antagonism against the pathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. a total of 17 different strains were identified. based on plate counting, all bio-yoghurts have at least total viable cells of approximately 10(7) cfu ml(-1). streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were the most frequently isolated bacteria. viable bifidobacterium was only recovered from one product. however, after pcr analysis, dna of this genus was confirmed in five out of seven products. major differences  were found for s. typhimurium antagonism. the adherence capacity to caco-2 cells  was observed in 10 of the isolated strains. in general, low survival to simulated gastric juice was observed. conclusions: some of the isolated strains have probiotic potential, although not all of them were present in the advised amount  to exert beneficial health effects. however, the full correct scientific name of  the isolated bacteria and their viable counts were not included on the product label. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report describing  the identification and functionality of starter bacteria and probiotics present in dairy products on the columbian market.

TI  == a randomized, controlled trial of lactic acid bacteria for idiopathic hyperoxaluria.
AB  == background: urinary oxalate excretion is an important contributor to calcium oxalate stone formation. methods of reducing oxalate excretion are not wholly satisfactory, and no controlled trials using them have been performed to prevent  stone recurrence. some lactic acid bacteria can degrade oxalate in vitro. this study sought to reduce urinary oxalate excretion in calcium stone formers with idiopathic hyperoxaluria. design, setting, participants, and measurements: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed of oxadrop, a mix of four lactic acid bacterium species. this preparation previously reduced oxalate excretion in stone formers with idiopathic and enteric hyperoxaluria. patients were selected from two stone prevention clinics. twenty people with calcium stones and idiopathic hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/d) were enrolled and randomly assigned 1:1 in placebo and active preparation arms. both groups took 3.6 g of granulate each day: either placebo or the experimental preparation. participants  performed two consecutive 24-h urine collections at baseline, at 28 d of therapy, and at 56 d, after being off the preparation for 4 wk. diet was replicated at each point. results: there was no effect of the study preparation: mean 24-h urinary oxalate excretion in placebo-treated patients was 73.9 mg at baseline and 72.7 mg after treatment, whereas the oxadrop-treated patients had 59.1 mg at baseline and 55.4 mg after treatment. the preparation was well tolerated; three participants on active treatment experienced mild constipation. conclusions: in this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, oxadrop did not reduce urinary oxalate excretion in participants with idiopathic hyperoxaluria.

TI  == use of human lysozyme transgenic goat milk in cheese making: effects on lactic acid bacteria performance.
AB  == genetically engineered goats expressing elevated levels of the antimicrobial enzyme lysozyme in their milk were developed to improve udder health, product shelf life, and consumer well-being. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of lysozyme on the development of lactic acid bacteria (lab) throughout the cheese-making process. raw and pasteurized milk from 7 lysozyme transgenic goats and 7 breed-, age-, and parity-matched nontransgenic controls was transformed into cheeses by using industry methods, and their microbiological load was evaluated. the numbers of colony-forming units of lab were determined for raw and pasteurized goat milk, whey, and curd at d 2 and at d 6 or 7 of production. selective plating media were used to enumerate lactococcal species separately from total lab. although differences in the mean number of colony-forming units between transgenic and control samples in raw milk, whey, and cheese curd were non-significant for both total lab and lactococcal species from d 2 of production, a significant decrease was observed in both types of lab  among d 6 transgenic raw milk cheese samples. in pasteurized milk trials, a significant decrease in lab was observed only in the raw milk of transgenic animals. these results indicate that lysozyme transgenic goat milk is not detrimental to lab growth during the cheese-making process.

TI  == galactose metabolism and capsule formation in a recombinant strain of streptococcus thermophilus with a galactose-fermenting phenotype.
AB  == the capsule-producing, galactose-negative streptococcus thermophilus mr-1c strain was first transformed with a low-copy plasmid containing a functional galk gene from streptococcus salivarius to generate a recombinant galactose-fermenting strep. thermophilus strain named mr-aac. then, we compared the functional properties of strep. thermophilus mr-aac with those of the parent mr-1c strain when used as starter for fermented products and cheese. in lactose-supplemented laboratory medium, mr-aac metabolized galactose, but only when the amount of lactose was less than 0.1% (wt/vol). after 7 h of fermentation, the medium was almost depleted of galactose. the parent strain, mr-1c, showed the same pattern,  except that the concentration of galactose decreased by only 25% during the same  period. it was found that, during milk fermentation and mozzarella cheese production, the galactose-fermenting phenotype was not expressed by mr-aac and this strain expelled galactose into the medium at a level similar to the parent mr-1c strain. in milk and in lactose-supplemented medium, capsular exopolysaccharide production occurred mainly during the late exponential phase and the stationary growth phase with similar kinetics between mr-1c and mr-aac.

TI  == quorum-sensing regulation of the production of blp bacteriocins in streptococcus  thermophilus.
AB  == the blp gene cluster identified in the genome sequences of streptococcus thermophilus (blp(st)) lmg18311, cnrz1066, and lmd-9 displays all the characteristics of a class ii bacteriocin locus. in the present study, we showed  that the blp(st) locus is only fully functional in strain lmd-9 and regulates the production of antimicrobial peptides that inhibit strains lmg18311 and cnrz1066.  the blp(st) cluster of lmd-9 contains 23 genes that are transcriptionally organized in six operons: blpabc(st) (peptide transporter genes and pheromone gene); blprh(st) (two-component regulatory system genes); blpd(st)-orf1, blpu(st)-orf3, and blpe-f(st) (bacteriocin precursors and immunity genes); and blpg-x(st) (unknown function). all the operons, except the regulatory unit blprh(st), were shown to be coregulated at the transcriptional level by a quorum-sensing mechanism involving the mature s. thermophilus pheromone blpc* (blpc*(st)), which was extracellularly detected as two active forms (30 and 19 amino acids). these operons are differentially transcribed depending on growth phase and pheromone concentration. they all contain a motif with two imperfect direct repeats in their mapped promoter regions that could serve as binding sites of the response regulator blpr(st). through the construction of deletion mutants, the blp(st) locus of strain lmd-9 was shown to encode all the essential functions associated with bacteriocin production, quorum-sensing regulation, and immunity.

TI  == control of methionine synthesis and uptake by metr and homocysteine in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == metr (formerly smu.1225), a regulator of the lysr family, controls key genes for  methionine supply in streptococcus mutans. an s. mutans metr mutant is unable to  transport l-methionine and to grow in the absence of this amino acid. accordingly, metr activates transcription by binding to the promoter regions of two gene clusters and smu.1487, whose products are involved in methionine biosynthesis (metef and smu.1487) and uptake (atmbde). transcriptional activation by metr requires the presence of a 17-bp palindromic sequence, the met box. base  substitutions in the met box hinder the formation of a metr-dna complex and abolish metr-dependent activation, showing that met boxes correspond to metr recognition sites. activation by metr occurs in methionine-depleted medium and is rapidly triggered under nonactivating conditions by the addition of homocysteine. this intermediate of methionine biosynthesis increases the affinity of metr for dna in vitro and appears to be the metr coeffector in vivo. homocysteine plays a  crucial role in methionine metabolic gene regulation by controlling metr activity. a similar mechanism of homocysteine- and metr-dependent control of methionine biosynthetic genes operates in s. thermophilus. these data suggest a common mechanism for the regulation of the methionine supply in streptococci. however, some streptococcal species are unable to synthesize the homocysteine coeffector. this intriguing feature is discussed in the light of comparative genomics and streptococcal ecology.

TI  == aspartate biosynthesis is essential for the growth of streptococcus thermophilus  in milk, and aspartate availability modulates the level of urease activity.
AB  == we investigated the carbon dioxide metabolism of streptococcus thermophilus, evaluating the phenotype of a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase-negative mutant obtained by replacement of a functional ppc gene with a deleted and inactive version, deltappc. the growth of the mutant was compared to that of the parent strain in a chemically defined medium and in milk, supplemented or not with l-aspartic acid, the final product of the metabolic pathway governed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. it was concluded that aspartate present in milk  is not sufficient for the growth of s. thermophilus. as a consequence, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity was considered fundamental for the biosynthesis of l-aspartic acid in s. thermophilus metabolism. this enzymatic activity is therefore essential for growth of s. thermophilus in milk even if s.  thermophilus was cultured in association with proteinase-positive lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. it was furthermore observed that the supplementation of milk with aspartate significantly affected the level of urease activity. further experiments, carried out with a p(urei)-gusa recombinant strain, revealed that expression of the urease operon was sensitive to the aspartate concentration in milk and to the cell availability of glutamate, glutamine, and ammonium ions.

TI  == [beneficial effects of consumption of a dairy product containing two probiotic strains, lactobacillus coryniformis cect5711 and lactobacillus gasseri cect5714 in healthy children].
AB  == objective: in the last decades there has been an increasing interest in the manipulation of intestinal microbiota with probiotics for the prevention and treatment of certain paediatric diseases. in addition, it has been suggested that probiotics could play a role in the development of immune system. recent studies  suggest that the administration of two probiotic strains, lactobacillus coryniformis cect5711 and lactobacillus gasseri cect5714 improves intestinal function of healthy adults and enhances the immune response. since there are few  studies reporting the use of probiotic in children, the main consumers of these products, the aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of the administration of the mentioned probiotic strains in healthy children. interventions: 30 children (age range 3-12) with no gastrointestinal pathology were included in the study. in addition to their usual diet, during the first 3 weeks they received 200 ml of a conventional yogurt containing lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. during the following three weeks this  yogurt was substi-tuted for 80 ml of a probiotic product (max defensas, puleva food s.l.) containing the same amounts of streptococcus thermophilus and the l. bulgaricus was substituted by a mixture of the target probiotic strains: l. coryniformis cect5711 and l. gasseri cect5714. samples of faeces and saliva were  taken at the beginning of the protocol, at week 3 and at the end of the study. intestinal microbiota, faecal citotoxicity and the inhibition of salmonella cholerasusis ssp. cholerasuis adhesion to intestinal mucins by the faeces were analyzed. finally, iga concentration was determined in the faecal and saliva samples. results: tolerance of the probiotic product was good in all the children included in the study. an increase in faecal lactobacilli counts was shown at the end of the experimental protocol (p < 0,05). in addition citotoxicity of faecal samples was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced after probiotic consumption. the inhibition of s. cholerasuis adhesion to intestinal mucins was significantly higher (p < 0.05) for faecal waters from children in week 6 compared to samples form week 0 and 3. probiotic consumption was also shown to increase iga concentration in faeces and saliva (p < 0.05). conclusions: the consumption of a  probiotic product containing l. coryniformis cect5711 and l. gasseri cect5714 improves intestinal flora of healthy children, enhancing the defence against gastrointestinal aggressions and infections both by inhibiting pathogen adhesion  to intestinal mucins and enhancing the immune function.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of lactobacillus gasseri expressing manganese superoxide dismutase using the interleukin 10-deficient mouse model of colitis.
AB  == emerging evidence has implicated reactive oxygen species (ros) in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). although intestinal epithelial  cells produce the ros-neutralizing enzyme superoxide dismutase (sod), the protein and activity levels of copper/zinc (cu/zn) and manganese (mn) sod are perturbed in inflamed tissues of ibd patients. thus we investigated the ability of mnsod from streptococcus thermophilus to reduce colitis symptoms in interleukin (il) 10-deficient mice using lactobacillus gasseri as a delivery vehicle. cohorts of 13-15 il-10-deficient mice were left untreated or supplemented with native l. gasseri or l. gasseri expressing mnsod for 4 wk. colonic tissue was collected and inflammation was histologically scored. the presence of innate immune cells was investigated by immunohistochemistry and the host antioxidant response was determined by quantitative pcr. it was demonstrated that l. gasseri was stably maintained in mice for at least 3 days. l. gasseri producing mnsod significantly  reduced inflammation in il-10-deficient mice compared with untreated controls (p  < 0.05), whereas the anti-inflammatory effects of both native and mnsod producing l. gasseri were more pronounced in males. the anti-inflammatory effects of l. gasseri were associated with a reduction in the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages. transcripts of antioxidant genes were equivalent in colonic tissues  obtained from control and probiotic-treated il-10-deficient mice. this study demonstrates that l. gasseri producing mnsod has significant anti-inflammatory activity that reduces the severity of colitis in the il-10-deficient mouse.

TI  == efficient method for generation of bacteriophage insensitive mutants of streptococcus thermophilus yoghurt and mozzarella strains.
AB  == bacteriophage infection of streptococcus thermophilus is becoming increasingly problematic in many industry fermentations such as yoghurt and mozzarella manufacture. this study describes the development of an efficient and rapid 3-step approach for the generation of bacteriophage insensitive mutants (bims) of these starter strains. the method initially involves infection of a culture in solid media at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 which is then incubated in milk overnight. bims are then isolated following successive rounds (20-25) of  growth in 10% reconstituted skimmed milk (rsm) in the presence of high phage titres. the method selects for bims which can grow efficiently in milk. using this approach bims of two industrial strains were generated, whose starter performance was comparable to the parent starters in terms of performance in milk. genomic fingerprinting used to validate the identity of each bim, revealed  a number of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflps) in two of the resultant bims. this method provides a simple and reliable method for generation  of bims of industrial starters which does not require any specialised equipment and should be widely applicable.

TI  == comparative sequence analysis of plasmids from lactobacillus delbrueckii and construction of a shuttle cloning vector.
AB  == while plasmids are very commonly associated with the majority of the lactic acid  bacteria, they are only very rarely associated with lactobacillus delbrueckii, with only four characterized to date. in this study, the complete sequence of a native plasmid, pdoj1, from a strain of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was determined. it consisted of a circular dna molecule of 6,220 bp with a g+c content of 44.6% and a characteristic ori and encoded six open reading frames (orfs), of which functions could be predicted for three-a mobilization (mob) protein, a transposase, and a fused primase-helicase replication protein. comparative analysis of pdoj1 and the other available l. delbrueckii plasmids (plbb1, pjbl2, pn42, and pll1212) revealed a very similar organization and amino  acid identities between 85 and 98% for the putative proteins of all six predicted orfs from pdoj1, reflecting a common origin for l. delbrueckii plasmids. analysis of the fused primase-helicase replication gene found a similar fused organization only in the theta replicating group b plasmids from streptococcus thermophilus. this observation and the ability of the replicon to function in s. thermophilus support the idea that the origin of plasmids in l. delbrueckii was likely from s. thermophilus. this may reflect the close association of these two species in dairy fermentations, particularly yogurt production. as no vector based on plasmid replicons from l. delbrueckii has previously been constructed, an escherichia coli-l. delbrueckii shuttle cloning vector, pdoj4, was constructed from pdoj1, the p15a ori, the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pci372, and the  lacz polylinker from puc18. this cloning vector was successfully introduced into  e. coli, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, s. thermophilus, and lactococcus lactis. this shuttle cloning vector provides a new tool for molecular analysis of lactobacillus delbrueckii and other lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == streptococci have been considered to lack the classical sos response, defined by  increased mutation after uv exposure and regulation by lexa. here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated sos mutagenesis gene cassette in the streptococcaceae family. exposure to uv light was found to increase mutations to  antibiotic resistance in streptococcus uberis cultures. the mutational spectra revealed mainly g:c-->a:t transitions, and northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a y-family dna polymerase resembling umuc under dna-damaging conditions. in the absence of the y-family polymerase, s. uberis cells were sensitive to uv light and to mitomycin c. furthermore, the uv-induced  mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the y-family polymerase. the gene encoding the y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a hdir homolog. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that s. uberis hdir binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus thermophilus strains. in addition, the umuc operon was localized in several mobile dna elements of streptococcus and lactococcus species. we conclude that the hdir-umuc-orf3-orf4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating sos mutagenesis among members of the streptococcaceae.

TI  == analysis of two theta-replicating plasmids of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == we report the characterization of two new theta-replicating plasmids of streptococcus thermophilus (psmq-312b and psmq-316) as well as the further analysis of psmq-308. the nucleotide sequences of psmq-312b and psmq-316 were determined and both contained 6710 bp. in fact, the two sequences were identical, despite that the plasmids were isolated from two different s. thermophilus strains as demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. comparative analyses indicated that the two plasmids were highly related to the previously characterized s. thermophilus plasmid psmq-308 (8144 bp). plasmid stability tests showed that psmq-312b/316 was more stable in lm17 medium while psmq-308 was the most stable in milk. the presence of the plasmids did not modify the acidification profile of the s. thermophilus strains during growth in milk and under time-temperature conditions mimicking an industrial process. these theta-replicating plasmids are unique genetic material for the construction of stable cloning vectors for industrially relevant strains of s. thermophilus.

TI  == rapid restoration of colonic goblet cells induced by a hydrolyzed diet containing probiotics in experimental malnutrition.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the effects of the addition of probiotic bacteria to a hydrolyzed diet on the recovery of goblet cells during renutrition in an animal model of malnutrition. methods: twenty-six male wistar rats (200-250g) were included in the study. six were kept under normal conditions (sham group) while twenty received an aproteic diet for 15 days, and were randomized thereafter to receive a hydrolyzed diet containing (n=6; probiotic group) or not (n=6; hydrolyzed group) probiotics (10(6) cfu/g of streptococcus thermophilus e lactobacillus helveticus); or immediately killed (n=8; aproteic group). histological slides containing cecal and sigmoid biopsies were used to counting the number of goblet cells and the goblet cells/colonocytes ratio. results: malnutrition diminished the population of goblet cells in all sites. goblet cells/colonocytes ratio of the probiotic group was significantly greater than hydrolyzed group at the ceccum (0.39 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.34 +/-0.02; p=0.02). only rats fed with probiotics showed complete restoration of the normal goblet cells/colonocytes ratio at the sigmoid (0.37 +/- 0,02 vs. 0.22 +/- 0,03; p<0,001). conclusion: streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus added to a renutrition diet enhance the recovery of mucosal atrophy induced by malnutrition and especially induce a rapid restoration of goblet cells population in the malnourished colonic mucosa.

TI  == transport capabilities of eleven gram-positive bacteria: comparative genomic analyses.
AB  == the genomes of eleven gram-positive bacteria that are important for human health  and the food industry, nine low g+c lactic acid bacteria and two high g+c gram-positive organisms, were analyzed for their complement of genes encoding transport proteins. thirteen to 18% of their genes encode transport proteins, larger percentages than observed for most other bacteria. all of these bacteria possess channel proteins, some of which probably function to relieve osmotic stress. amino acid uptake systems predominate over sugar and peptide cation symporters, and of the sugar uptake porters, those specific for oligosaccharides  and glycosides often outnumber those for free sugars. about 10% of the total transport proteins are constituents of putative multidrug efflux pumps with major facilitator superfamily (mfs)-type pumps (55%) being more prevalent than atp-binding cassette (abc)-type pumps (33%), which, however, usually greatly outnumber all other types. an exception to this generalization is streptococcus thermophilus with 54% of its drug efflux pumps belonging to the abc superfamily and 23% belonging each to the multidrug/oligosaccharide/polysaccharide (mop) superfamily and the mfs. these bacteria also display peptide efflux pumps that may function in intercellular signalling, and macromolecular efflux pumps, many of predictable specificities. most of the bacteria analyzed have no pmf-coupled or transmembrane flow electron carriers. the one exception is brevibacterium linens, which in addition to these carriers, also has transporters of several families not represented in the other ten bacteria examined. comparisons with the genomes of organisms from other bacterial kingdoms revealed that lactic acid bacteria possess distinctive proportions of recognized transporter types (e.g., more porters specific for glycosides than reducing sugars). some homologues of transporters identified had previously been identified only in gram-negative bacteria or in eukaryotes. our studies reveal unique characteristics of the lactic acid bacteria such as the universal presence of genes encoding mechanosensitive channels, competence systems and large numbers of sugar transporters of the phosphotransferase system. the analyses lead to important physiological predictions regarding the preferred signalling and metabolic activities of these industrially important bacteria.

TI  == possible mechanisms of antimutagenicity in fermented soymilk prepared with a coculture of streptococcus infantis and bifidobacterium infantis.
AB  == the possible mechanisms of antimutagenicity against 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide (4-nqo; a direct mutagen) and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (dmab; an indirect mutagen) were examined in fermented soymilk prepared with a coculture of streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium infantis. the antimutagenicity in  the fermented soymilk was not due to the bioantimutagenic effect of modulation of dna repair processes. the mutagenicity of dmab decreased with increased preincubation of fermented soymilk and the dmab metabolite but not with intact dmab or an s9 mixture. mutagenicity of 4-nqo was not affected by preincubation of fermented soymilk with this mutagen. mutagenicity of both 4-nqo and dmab was reduced when salmonella typhimurium ta 100 was pretreated with fermented soymilk, indicating that fermented soymilk affected the function of the bacterial cell, which might also lead to reduced mutagenicity of the tested mutagens. desmutagenic and blocking effects were the main mechanisms of antimutagenicity in the fermented soymilk against dmba. in contrast, the antimutagenic effect of the  fermented soymilk on 4-nqo was primarily due to a blocking effect.

TI  == novel optimal temperature profile for acidification process of lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus in yoghurt fermentation using artificial neural network and genetic algorithm.
AB  == the acidification behavior of lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus for yoghurt production was investigated along temperature profiles within the optimal window of 38-44 degrees c. for the optimal acidification temperature profile search, an optimization engine module built on a modular artificial neural network (ann) and genetic algorithm (ga) was used. fourteen batches of yoghurt fermentations were evaluated using different temperature profiles in order to train and validate the ann sub-module. the ann captured the  nonlinear relationship between temperature profiles and acidification patterns on training data after 150 epochs. this served as an evaluation function for the ga. the acidification slope of the temperature profile was the performance index. the ga sub-module iteratively evolved better temperature profiles across generations  using ga operations. the stopping criterion was met after 11 generations. the optimal profile showed an acidification slope of 0.06117 compared to an initial value of 0.0127 and at a set point sequence of 43, 38, 44, 43, and 39 degrees c.  laboratory evaluation of three replicates of the ga suggested optimum profile of  43, 38, 44, 43, and 39 degrees c gave an average slope of 0.04132. the optimization engine used (to be published elsewhere) could effectively search for optimal profiles of different physico-chemical parameters of fermentation processes.

TI  == conjugated linoleic acid conversion by dairy bacteria cultured in mrs broth and buffalo milk.
AB  == aims: to evaluate strains of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococci for their ability to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) from free linoleic acid (la). methods and results: eight dairy bacteria tolerant to la were grown in mrs  broth containing la (200 microg ml(-1)) and cla was assessed. seven bacteria were able to form cla after 24 h of incubation, varying percentage conversion between  17% and 36%. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus showed the highest la conversion and were  inoculated into buffalo milk supplemented with different concentration of la. the production of cla at 200 microg ml(-1) of la was two- or threefold in milk than mrs broth. all evaluated strains were able to produce cla from high la levels (1000 microg ml(-1)). conclusions: the most tolerant strain to la was lact. casei. lacttobacillus rhamnosus produced the maximum level of cla at high la concentrations (800 microg ml(-1)). the selected bacteria may be considered as adjunct cultures to be included on dairy fermented products manufacture. low concentration of la must be added to the medium to enhance cla formation. significance and impact of the study: the production of cla by strains using milks from regional farms as medium offer a possible mechanism to enhance this beneficial compound in dairy products and those the possibility to develop functional foods.

TI  == selection and properties of alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient spontaneous mutants of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == many lactic acid bacteria produce diacetyl, which is a desirable aroma compound in some fermented dairy products. strains or mutants of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis that are deficient in alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase are used in some food processes for their ability to produce large  amounts of diacetyl. however, up until now, the use of alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutants of streptococcus thermophilus for increased diacetyl production has not been evaluated. the objective of the present study was to devise a procedure for selecting spontaneous alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutants of s. thermophilus. we observed that in a chemically defined medium (cdm) containing alpha-ketobutyrate plus leucine, or alpha-ketobutyrate plus leucine plus isoleucine, the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutant til865, obtained by directed mutagenesis, grew faster than its parent strain. this property was used for selecting spontaneous alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutants on agar plates. the resulting  mutants were able to grow in milk, and their acidifying activity was slightly lower than that of the parent strain. under partial anaerobic or aerobic conditions, they produced approximately three times more diacetyl than the parent strain. such spontaneous mutants may be useful for increasing the diacetyl content of fermented milks whose production involves s. thermophilus strains.

TI  == a widespread picture of the streptococcus thermophilus proteome by cell lysate fractionation and gel-based/gel-free approaches.
AB  == among the group of lactic acid bacteria, streptococcus thermophilus has found a wide application in industrial processes used for the manufacture of dairy products. taking advantage of different proteome extraction and subfractionation  protocols, bacterial cytosolic and membrane proteins were isolated and resolved by independent gel-free and gel-based separation procedures. whole cytosolic fraction and its acid, basic and low molecular mass protein components were separated by different resolutive 2-de and tricine 1-de gels and identified by maldi-tof pmf and/or microlc-esi-it-ms/ms. membrane proteins were resolved by 2-de and sds-page gels and similarly identified by pmf and tms analysis. in parallel, whole extract was trypsinized and resulting peptides were identified by shotgun 2-d lc-esi-it-ms/ms analysis. using this combined approach, expression products corresponding to 458 different genes were identified, which cover almost a third of the predicted vegetative proteome. relative protein concentration and  hydrophobicity affected protein detection. broad recognition was obtained for enzymes involved in carbohydrate, fatty acid, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, replication, transcription, translation, cell wall synthesis, as well as for proteins affecting bacterial functions important for industrial applications, i.e. milk sugar import and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. by providing detailed reference electrophoretic/chromatographic maps to be used in future comparative proteomic investigations on bacteria grown under various experimental conditions or on different bacterial strains, our results will favour dedicated studies on s. thermophilus metabolism and its regulation or on detection of biomarkers for selection of optimal strains for industrial applications.

TI  == probiotics--the friendly bacteria with market potential in global market.
AB  == with the growing interest in self-care and integrative medicine coupled with our  health-embracing increasing population, recognition of the link between diet and  health has never been stronger. as a result, the market for functional foods, or  foods that promote health beyond providing basic nutrition, is flourishing. within the functional foods movement is the small but rapidly expanding arena of  probiotics - live microbial food supplements that beneficially affect an individual by improving intestinal microbial balance. the consumers' overwhelming interest in and demand for functional foods, including probiotics, make it imperative that health professionals stay abreast of the latest research findings and available products. the global market for functional foods in the coming years is predicted to grow rapidly. although japan currently accounts for about one-half of this market, the fastest rate of growth is expected to be in the united states. probiotic products represent a strong growth area within the functional foods group and intense research efforts are under way to develop dairy products into which probiotic organisms such as lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species are incorporated. such probiotic foods may modulate gut microbial composition, thereby leading to improved gut health, for example, through improved tolerance to lactose in lactose-intolerant individuals or improved resistance to pathogenic bacteria. the fast-growing probiotics market holds a wealth of opportunities, especially for those companies that understand and cater for the final consumer. this monograph provides a summary of research on the health benefits of probiotics and offers information regarding the global  market potential of probiotics.

TI  == influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. the major species used in dairy manufacturing are lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and leuconostoc. traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. the appearance of the genomes of lactococcus lactis, bidifobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, 2  strains of streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of lab. moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different lab in  the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.

AB  == lactococcus lactis is of great importance for the nutrition of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. this paper describes the genome sequence of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363, the lactococcal strain most intensively studied throughout the world. the 2,529,478-bp genome contains 81 pseudogenes and encodes 2,436 proteins. of the 530 unique proteins, 47 belong to  the cog (clusters of orthologous groups) functional category "carbohydrate metabolism and transport," by far the largest category of novel proteins in comparison with l. lactis subsp. lactis il1403. nearly one-fifth of the 71 insertion elements are concentrated in a specific 56-kb region. this integration  hot-spot region carries genes that are typically associated with lactococcal plasmids and a repeat sequence specifically found on plasmids and in the "lateral gene transfer hot spot" in the genome of streptococcus thermophilus. although the parent of l. lactis mg1363 was used to demonstrate lysogeny in lactococcus, l. lactis mg1363 carries four remnant/satellite phages and two apparently complete prophages. the availability of the l. lactis mg1363 genome sequence will reinforce its status as the prototype among lactic acid bacteria through facilitation of further applied and fundamental research.

AB  == a novel streptococcus pneumoniae plasmid (pspnp1; 5413bp) has been isolated from  the multidrug-resistant clone poland(23f)-16, and its complete nucleotide sequence has been determined. sequence analysis predicted seven co-directional open reading frames and comparative analyses revealed that plasmid pspnp1 is different to pdp1, the only previously described pneumococcal plasmid, whereas it is highly similar to pst08, a plasmid from streptococcus thermophilus. a double-stranded origin for replication similar to the replication origin of the pc194/pub110 family was located upstream of the putative rep gene (orf2). it also contained a 144-bp region with over 60% identity to the single-stranded origin type a of the streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pmv158/pls1. detection of single-stranded dna by southern blot analysis indicated that pspnp1 replicates via a rolling circle mechanism. interestingly, the product of orf1 has a putative zonular occludens toxin conserved domain present in toxigenic strains of vibrio cholerae. real-time pcr assays revealed that this orf was expressed. hybridization experiments showed that the pspnp1 replicon was unusual among other examined antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal clones, although the recombinant plasmids based on pspnp1 were able to replicate in bacillus subtilis and lactococcus lactis.

TI  == production of yoghurt with mild taste by a lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus mutant with altered proteolytic properties.
AB  == in this communication, we describe the isolation of a lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 92063 mutant strain named ph-p11, which differed from the parent strain by low proteolytic activity and altered regulation of expression of lacz in the presence of glucose or lactose. in the presence of lactose, beta-galactosidase activity was approximately twice as high in ph-p11 than in the wild type. ph-p11 exhibited protosymbiosis together with streptococcus thermophilus. yoghurt produced with ph-p11 was characterized by low acidity and little post-acidification during storage. the organoleptic properties (absence of bitterness and other off-flavors, weak sourness, and clear yoghurt taste) were those of a typical "yoghurt mild". this mild flavor was achieved at rather high cell counts of lactobacilli even at the end of shelf-life. high cell counts in conjunction with high beta-galactosidase activity make ph-p11 an interesting strain for application in yoghurt especially designed for consumers with lactose  malabsorption. in contrast to "yoghurt mild", which is predominantly produced with lactobacillus acidophilus together with streptococcus thermophilus, the product obtained by fermentation with ph-p11 and streptococcus thermophilus concurs with international standards for yoghurt. during frequent sub-culturing,  strain ph-p11, which is supposed to differ from the wild type by one or a few so-far-not-characterized mutations, showed sufficient stability for application in industrial production.

TI  == isolation and characterization of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus from plants in bulgaria.
AB  == one of the traditional ways of preparation of yogurt starter in bulgaria is placing a branch of a particular plant species into boiled sheep's milk maintained at about 45 degrees c, which is further incubated until a dense coagulum is obtained. to investigate the possible origin of the yogurt starter bacteria, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) and streptococcus thermophilus (s. thermophilus), the traditional way of yogurt-starter preparation was followed. hundreds of plant samples were collected from four regions in bulgaria and incubated in sterile skim milk. the two target  bacteria at low frequencies from the plant samples collected were successfully isolated. phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of these bacterial isolates revealed that they were identified as l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus. twenty isolates of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, respectively, were selected from the isolated strains and further characterized with regard to their performance in yogurt production. organoleptic and physical properties of yogurt prepared using the isolated strains from plants were not significantly different from those prepared using commercial yogurt-starter strains. it was therefore suggested that l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus strains widely used for commercial yogurt production could have originated from plants in bulgaria. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation and characterization of  l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus strains from plants.

TI  == acid adaptation affects the viability of salmonella typhimurium during the lactic fermentation of skim milk and product storage.
AB  == in this study, salmonella typhimurium was acid adapted at ph 5.5 for 4 h. the viability of the acid-adapted and non-adapted cells of s. typhimurium was investigated both during the lactic fermentation of skim milk with streptococcus  thermophilus or lactobacillus bulgaricus, and during the storage of lactic fermented milk products at 5 degrees c. it was found that the viable population of s. typhimurium, regardless of acid adaptation, increased in skim milk during the initial 24 h of lactic fermentation and then declined. however, the viable population of acid-adapted s. typhimurium was significantly higher (p<.05) than that of non-adapted cell at the end of 48 h of fermentation. acid-adapted cells of s. typhimurium were also found to have survived better than non-adapted cells  in the s. thermophilus-prepared fermented milk and two commercial lactic fermented milk products. the viability of the acid-adapted and non-adapted s. typhimurium at 5 and 37 degrees c in cell-free fermented milks that had their phs adjusted to 6.4 and skim milk (ph 6.4) was further investigated. results revealed that acid adaptation, in addition to enhancing acid tolerance, reduced the susceptibility of s. typhimurium to refrigerated temperature and other detrimental factors which might be present in lactic fermented milk products. these responses all contribute to the enhanced survival of acid-adapted s. typhimurium in the lactic fermented milk products observed in the present study.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB  == the outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. this study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. we isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the  genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. all the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. a multiplex-pcr with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. all bifidobacteria were b. animalis subsp. lactis except  one bifidobacterium longum. sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. the lactobacilli were lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. the streptococci were all streptococcus thermophilus. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. all tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin g, rifampicin (mic(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml);  resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin b and spectinomycin (mic(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). the susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacilli isolated from soft and semihard argentinean cheeses: genetic characterization and resistance to biological barriers.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and  soft cheeses made with multistrain streptococcus thermophilus starters. lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) cfu/g and  then reached 10(7) cfu/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always  above 10(9) cfu/g. a total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. species identity was determined  by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific pcr assays. genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr analysis. the lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, and l. perolens. all the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. after incubation in gastric solution (ph 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. the strains were able to grow in the presence of  bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. the nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. it was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics  compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.

TI  == first complete genome sequence of two staphylococcus epidermidis bacteriophages.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis is an important opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infections and is often associated with infections in patients with implanted prosthetic devices. a number of virulence determinants have been identified in s. epidermidis, which are typically acquired through horizontal gene transfer. due to the high recombination potential, bacteriophages play an important role in these transfer events. knowledge of phage genome sequences provides insights into phage-host biology and evolution. we present the complete  genome sequence and a molecular characterization of two s. epidermidis phages, phiph15 (ph15) and phicnph82 (cnph82). both phages belonged to the siphoviridae family and produced stable lysogens. the ph15 and cnph82 genomes displayed high sequence homology; however, our analyses also revealed important functional differences. the ph15 genome contained two introns, and in vivo splicing of phage mrnas was demonstrated for both introns. secondary structures for both introns were also predicted and showed high similarity to those of streptococcus thermophilus phage 2972 introns. an additional finding was differential superinfection inhibition between the two phages that corresponded with differences in nucleotide sequence and overall gene content within the lysogeny module. we conducted phylogenetic analyses on all known siphoviridae, which showed ph15 and cnph82 clustering with staphylococcus aureus, creating a novel clade within the s. aureus group and providing a higher overall resolution of the siphophage branch of the phage proteomic tree than previous studies. until now, no s. epidermidis phage genome sequences have been reported in the literature, and thus this study represents the first complete genomic and molecular description of two s. epidermidis phages.

TI  == susceptibility of streptococcus thermophilus to antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 74 streptococcus thermophilus isolates collected between 1948 and 2005 from different environments were investigated to assess erythromycin, clindamycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline and ampicillin susceptibility by means of microdilution, etest and disk diffusion methods. for this purpose a new s. thermophilus susceptibility test medium (ssm) was developed. this medium allowed a better identification of strains with atypical tetracycline resistance. the recipe is a mixed formulation of iso-sensitest medium (90% v/v) and m17 medium (10% v/v) supplemented with lactose (0.5% w/v). the overall agreement of the techniques was good with exception of tetracycline, for which etest provided  lower mics than the microdilution method. most strains were susceptible to all the antibiotics tested while a few erythromycin, tetracycline and streptomycin resistant strains were detected.

TI  == lactobacillus fermentum br11, a potential new probiotic, alleviates symptoms of colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (dss) in rats.
AB  == current treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are relatively ineffective. recently, probiotics have emerged as a potential treatment modality  for numerous gastrointestinal disorders, including ibd. few probiotics, however,  have undergone appropriate preclinical screening in vivo. the current study compared the effects of four candidate probiotics on development of dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis in rats. sprague dawley rats were gavaged 1  ml of the potential probiotic (1 x 10(10) cfu/ml), or vehicle, twice daily for 14 days. strains tested were lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), streptococcus thermophilus th-4 (th-4), bifidobacterium lactis bb12 (bb12) and lactobacillus fermentum br11 (br11). colitis was induced from day 7 to 14 via administration of 2% dss in drinking water. disease activity index (dai) was monitored daily until  rats were killed at day 14. dai decreased in dss+bb12 and dss+br11 compared to dss+vehicle. colon length increased in dss+br11 (10%) and dss+lgg (10%) compared  to dss+vehicle. dss+bb12 and dss+br11 prevented the distal colon crypt hyperplasia evident in dss+vehicle, dss+lgg and dss+th-4. br11 was most effective at reducing colitic symptoms. bb12 had minimal effects, whilst th-4 did not prevent dss-colitis and lgg actually exacerbated some indicators of colitis. further studies into the potential benefits of l. fermentum br11 are indicated.

AB  == the aim of this study was to identify and discriminate bacteria contained in commercial fermented milks with bifidobacteria by the use of amplified ribosomal  dna restriction analysis (ardra) and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) techniques. ardra of the 16s rdna gene and rapd were performed on 13 lactobacillus strains, 13 streptococcus and 13 bifidobacterium strains isolated from commercial fermented milk. lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium animalis isolates were identified by genus- and  species-pcr and also, they were differentiated at genus and species level by ardra using mwoi restriction enzyme. the ardra technique allowed for the discrimination among these three related genus with the use of only one restriction enzyme, since distinctive profiles were obtained for each genus. therefore it can be a simple, rapid and useful method for routine identification. also, rapd technique allowed the discrimination of all bacteria contained in dairy products, at genus- and strain-level by the performance of one pcr reaction.

AB  == in streptococcus thermophilus, the eps clusters involved in exopolysaccharide (eps) biosynthesis are very polymorphic, nevertheless they all contain a highly conserved sequence corresponding to that of orf14.9. this open reading frame (orf) is transcribed in a reverse direction with respect to eps genes. amino acid sequence analysis showed a possible transmembrane location of the putative orf14.9 protein but did not permit a proposed function. insertional mutants of orf14.9 were obtained in strains nst2280 and a054 of s. thermophilus. eps yields  of these mutants are similar to those of their respective wild strains, suggesting that orf14.9 does not modify the quantity of produced eps. growth parameter determination for wild strains and their respective mutants showed that orf14.9 is involved in the cell growth of s. thermophilus.

TI  == the smr gene resides on a novel plasmid psp187 identified in a staphylococcus pasteuri isolate recovered from unpasteurized milk.
AB  == this work describes a novel plasmid psp187 (5550 bp) carrying the small multidrug resistance determinant smr encoding resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (qacs). psp187 was identified in a staphylococcus pasteuri isolate recovered from bulk milk in a dairy cattle herd in norway. sequence analysis revealed 6 putative orfs in addition to the smr gene within a cassette with identical genetic organization to that found in the psk41-like staphylococcus aureus plasmid ptz22. a protein homology search suggested the gene product of orf7 to be a putative replication initiation protein, while orf2 was predicted to encode a protein homologous to members of ftsk/spoiiie cell division-dna segregation protein families. sequence similarities to some initiator proteins of rolling circle replicons (rcr) indicated that psp187 uses a rcr mode of replication, supported by the detection of intermediate ssdna using s1 nuclease treatment and hybridization analysis. interestingly, a 30-bp sequence found upstream from orf7  showed high similarity to other dyad symmetry motifs proposed as putative double-strand origins of replication in the plasmids pgi3 (bacillus thuringiensis), pstk1 (bacillus stearothermophilus), and per1-2 (streptococcus thermophilus). in conclusion: the novel smr-containing plasmid psp187 is the first member of rcr group vi to be identified in a staphylococcus sp.

AB  == objectives: little information is available on the properties of fermented milk formula intended to healthy infants. this study analyzes the effect of long-term  ingestion of a heat-treated, fermented milk formula on the development of oral tolerance or systemic immune response to soluble antigens in mice. materials and  methods: the c3h/hen mice, fed with a heat-treated fermented (bifidobacterium breve c50 and streptococcus thermophilus 065) infant formula (htff) or a matched  control diet (control), were immunized with ovalbumin (ova) with or without gavage of 20 mg ova to induce tolerance or immunity, respectively. systemic and local anti-ova immune responses and intestinal barrier function were measured after 5 to 6 weeks. results: oral tolerance to ova developed similarly in htff- and control-fed mice, attested to by the downregulation of ova-specific immunoglobulin (ig) g and ige after oral ova administration. in contrast, immunization with ova led to significantly higher titers in htff-fed mice than in control-fed mice (log2 igg titers, 16.45 +/- 1.24 and 15.46 +/- 0.79, respectively; p = 0.012). jejunal interferon gamma, interleukin 12p40 and interleukin 10 expressions were significantly higher in tolerized mice fed with htff compared with those fed with the control diet. mucosal to serosal intact horseradish peroxidase fluxes were lower in htff-fed mice than in control-fed mice (39 +/- 8 and 118 +/- 38 ng/h x cm2, respectively; p < 0.0001), indicating that the htff diet reinforces intestinal barrier capacity to macromolecules. conclusions: in mice, htff strengthens intestinal barrier and enhances systemic immune responses to antigens without interfering with the development of oral tolerance, suggesting a potential beneficial effect in host defence and vaccination.

TI  == natural genetic transformation: a novel tool for efficient genetic engineering of the dairy bacterium streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is widely used for the manufacture of yoghurt and swiss or italian-type cheeses. these products have a market value of approximately 40 billion dollars per year, making s. thermophilus a species that  has major economic importance. even though the fermentation properties of this bacterium have been gradually improved by classical methods, there is great potential for further improvement through genetic engineering. due to the recent  publication of three complete genome sequences, it is now possible to use a rational approach for designing s. thermophilus starter strains with improved properties. progress in this field, however, is hampered by a lack of genetic tools. therefore, we developed a system, based on natural transformation, which makes genetic manipulations in s. thermophilus easy, rapid, and highly efficient. the efficiency of this novel tool should make it possible to construct food-grade mutants of s. thermophilus, opening up exciting new possibilities that should benefit consumers as well as the dairy industry.

TI  == altered nucleotide sugar metabolism in streptococcus thermophilus interferes with nitrogen metabolism.
AB  == exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus strains have attracted interest recently, since the epss act as natural viscosifiers and texture enhancers of fermented foods. we have previously reported that the low level of eps production by s. thermophilus ly03 could be improved by altering the activities of enzymes in the central carbon metabolism involved in the nucleotide sugar metabolism. in this study, we observed a reduced growth in milk for the strains with increased udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase (galu) activity together with either enhanced phosphoglucomutase activity, and/or enhanced activity of the leloir enzymes. rapid growth of these mutants in milk could be restored by the addition of four specific amino acids, i.e. glu, his, met, and val. this amino acid requirement was confirmed in a defined medium. furthermore, the 31p nmr spectra showed higher levels of the galu reactants pyrophosphate (ppi) and udp-glucose in the engineered strain, tmb 6013, compared to the parent strain, ly03. these products plus glu and the galu reactant utp are known to be involved  in the nitrogen regulatory system in many bacteria. thus, these results suggest that the reaction catalyzed by galu is connected to the nitrogen demand of these  engineered strains.

AB  == the underlying method for obtaining a beta-carotene-rich carotenoid-protein preparation and exopolysaccharides is the associated cultivation of the carotenoid-synthesizing lactose-negative yeast strain rhodotorula rubra ged8 with the yogurt starter culture (lactobacillus bulgaricus 2-11 + streptococcus thermophilus 15ha) in whey ultrafiltrate (45 g lactose/l) with a maximum carotenoid yield of 13.37 mg/l culture fluid on the 4.5th day. the chemical composition of the carotenoid-protein preparation has been identified. the respective carotenoid and protein content is 497.4 microg/g dry cells and 50.3% per dry weight, respectively. an important characteristic of the carotenoid composition is the high percentage (51.1%) of beta-carotene (a carotenoid pigment with the highest provitamin a activity) as compared to 12.9% and 33.7%, respectively, for the other two individual pigments--torulene and torularhodin. exopolysaccharides (12.8 g/l) synthesized by the yeast and lactic acid cultures,  identified as acid biopolymers containing 7.2% glucuronic acid, were isolated in  the cell-free supernatant. mannose, produced exclusively by the yeast, predominated in the neutral carbohydrate biopolymer component (76%). the mixed cultivation of r. rubra ged8 with the yogurt starter (l. bulgaricus 2-11 + s. thermophilus 15ha) in ultrafiltrate under conditions of intracellular production  of maximum amount of carotenoids and exopolysaccharides synthesis enables combined utilization of the culture fluid from the fermentation process.

TI  == control of epse, the phosphoglycosyltransferase initiating exopolysaccharide synthesis in streptococcus thermophilus, by epsd tyrosine kinase.
AB  == we studied the roles of streptococcus thermophilus phosphogalactosyltransferase (epse) (the priming enzyme), tyrosine kinase (epsd), phosphatase (epsb), and a membrane-associated protein with no known biochemical function (epsc) in exopolysaccharide (eps) synthesis. these proteins are well-conserved among bacteria and are usually encoded by clustered genes. exopolysaccharide synthesis  took place in the wild-type strain and a mutant lacking epsb but not in mutants lacking epsc, epsd, or epse. the three mutants unable to synthesize eps lacked the epse phosphogalactosyltransferase activity, while the two eps-synthesizing strains possessed this activity, showing that epsc and epsd are required for epse function. an epsd phosphorylated form was found in all strains except the epsc mutant, indicating that epsc is necessary for epsd phosphorylation. moreover, the phosphorylated form of epsd, a supposedly cytoplasmic protein, was found to be associated with the plasma membrane, possibly due to interaction with epsc. finally, the epsd and epse elution profiles in a gel filtration chromatography assay were similar, suggesting that these two proteins colocalize in the membrane. mutation of tyr200, predicted to be a phosphorylation site and present  in a conserved motif in bacterial phosphoglycosyltransferases, led to epse inactivation. in contrast, mutation of tyr162 or tyr199 had no effect. taken together, these data show that epsd controls epse activity. possible mechanisms for this control are discussed.

AB  == background: reca is a highly conserved prokaryotic protein that not only plays several important roles connected to dna metabolism but also affects the cell response to various stress conditions. while reca is highly conserved, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of its structural gene is less conserved. in escherichia coli the lexa protein acts as a reca repressor and is able, in response to dna damage, of reca-promoted self-cleavage, thus allowing reca transcription. the lexa paradigm, although confirmed in a wide number of cases, is not universally valid. in some cases lexa does not control reca transcription  while in other reca-containing bacteria a lexa homologue is not present. results: we have studied the reca transcriptional regulation in s. thermophilus, a bacterium that does not contain a lexa homologue. we have characterized the promoter region of the gene and observed that its expression is strongly induced  by dna damage. the analysis of deletion mutants and of translational gene fusions showed that a dna region of 83 base pairs, containing the reca promoter and the transcriptional start site, is sufficient to ensure normal expression of the gene. unlike lexa of e. coli, the factor controlling reca expression in s. thermophilus acts in a reca-independent way since reca induction was observed in  a strain carrying a reca null mutation. conclusion: in s. thermophilus, as in many other bacteria,reca expression is strongly induced by dna damage, however, in this organism expression of the gene is controlled by a factor different from  those well characterized in other bacteria. a small dna region extending from 62  base pairs upstream of the reca transcriptional start site to 21 base pairs downstream of it carries all the information needed for normal regulation of the  s. thermophilus reca gene.

TI  == gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  == bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (lgt) is  a predominant force in bacterial evolution. to better understand the significance of lgt, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal  genomes using a maximum likelihood method. this study indicates that the rate of  gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each  species. we have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by lgt and conclude that at least  a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.

TI  == diversity of streptococcus thermophilus phages in a large-production cheese factory in argentina.
AB  == phage infections still represent a serious risk to the dairy industry, in which streptococcus thermophilus is used in starter cultures for the manufacture of yogurt and cheese. the goal of the present study was to analyze the biodiversity  of the virulent s. thermophilus phage population in one argentinean cheese plant. ten distinct s. thermophilus phages were isolated from cheese whey samples collected in a 2-mo survey. they were then characterized by their morphology, host range, and restriction patterns. these phages were also classified within the 2 main groups of s. thermophilus phages (cos- and pac-type) using a newly adapted multiplex pcr method. six phages were classified as cos-type phages, whereas the 4 others belonged to the pac-type group. this study illustrates the phage diversity that can be found in one factory that rotates several cultures of s. thermophilus. limiting the number of starter cultures is likely to reduce phage biodiversity within a fermentation facility.

TI  == multiplex pcr for the detection and identification of dairy bacteriophages in milk.
AB  == bacteriophage infections of starter lactic acid bacteria are a serious risk in the dairy industry. phage infection can lead to slow lactic acid production or even the total failure of fermentation. the associated economic losses can be substantial. rapid and sensitive methods are therefore required to detect and identify phages at all stages of the manufacture of fermented dairy products. this study describes a simple and rapid multiplex pcr method that, in a single reaction, detects the presence of bacteriophages infecting streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, plus three genetically distinct 'species' of lactococcus lactis phages commonly found in dairy plants (p335, 936  and c2). available bacteriophage genome sequences were examined and the conserved regions used to design five pairs of primers, one for each of the above bacteriophage species. these primers were designed to generate specific fragments of different size depending on the species. since this method can detect the above phages in untreated milk and can be easily incorporated into dairy industry routines, it might be readily used to earmark contaminated milk for use in processes that do not involve susceptible starter organisms or for use in those that involve phage-deactivating conditions.

TI  == transformation of isoflavone phytoestrogens during the fermentation of soymilk with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == in the present study, soymilk is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus bcrc 14085, lactobacillus acidophilus bcrc 14079) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis bcrc 14633, b. longum b6) individually,  and in combination. the change in the content of various isoflavones (aglycones,  glucoside, acetyl- and malonyl-glucosides) and the beta-glucosidase activity in soymilk during fermentation is investigated. it is observed that fermented soymilk contains a lower total isoflavone content (81.94-86.61 microg/ml) than soymilk without fermentation (87.61 microg/ml). regardless of starter organism employed, fermentation causes a major reduction in the contents of glucoside, malonylglucoside and acetylglucoside isoflavones along with a significant increase of aglycone isoflavones content. the level of change in the content of various isoflavones and beta-glucosidase activity after fermentation varies with  the starter organism. among all the fermented soymilks tested, soymilk fermented  with s. thermophilus showed the highest beta-glucosidase activity and the greatest increase in the contents of aglycones. the percentage of daidzein, genistein and glycitein to total isoflavone content in s. thermophilus-fermented  soymilk increases from an initial 14.24%, 6.89% and 2.45%, respectively, to 36.20%, 28.80% and 12.44% after 24h of fermentation. finally, the increase of aglycones and decrease of glucoside isoflavones during fermentation coincides with the increase of beta-glucosidase activity observed in fermented soymilk.

TI  == antioxidative activities of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == to further the goal of developing a probiotic dietary adjunct using soymilk, soymilk is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus ccrc 14079 or streptococcus thermophilus ccrc 14085) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis ccrc 14633 or bifidobacterium longum b6) individually,  and in conjunction. we investigate several antioxidative activities including the inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation, the scavenging effect of superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide, and the reducing activity exerted by different varieties of fermented soymilks. in addition, the effect of spray-drying and freeze-drying on changes in antioxidative activity is examined. we find that in fermented soymilk both the inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation, and the reducing activity and scavenging effect of superoxide anion radicals varied with the starters used, but nevertheless are significantly higher than those found in unfermented soymilk. in general, antioxidative activity in soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria simultaneously is significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that fermented with either individually. moreover, antioxidative activity increases as the fermentation period is extended. however, unfermented soymilk shows an h2o2-scavenging effect, while there is no scavenging effect except for the accumulation of h2o2 in fermented soymilk. finally, we find that freeze-drying causes a significantly lesser (p < 0.05) reduction in the antioxidative activity of soymilk than does spray-drying. irrespective of the drying method and the starters used for fermentation. the antioxidative activity  of fermented soymilk reduces after drying yet remains higher than that of dried unfermented soymilk.

TI  == probiotics in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  == objective: to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) in children. study design: the following electronic databases up to december 2005, in any language, were searched for studies relevant to aad and probiotics: medline, embase, and the cochrane library. only randomized controlled trials (rct) were considered for study inclusion. results: six placebo-controlled, rcts (766 children) were included. treatment with probiotics compared with placebo reduced the risk of aad from 28.5% to 11.9% (relative risk, rr, 0.44, 95% ci 0.25 to 0.77, random effect  model). preplanned subgroup analysis showed that reduction of the risk of aad was associated with the use of lactobacillus gg (2 rcts, 307 participants, rr 0.3, 95% ci 0.15 to 0.6), s. boulardii (1 rct, 246 participants, rr 0.2, 95% ci 0.07-0.6), or b. lactis & str. thermophilus (1 rct, 157 participants, rr 0.5, 95% ci 0.3 to 0.95). conclusions: probiotics reduce the risk of aad in children. for  every 7 patients that would develop diarrhea while being treated with antibiotics, one fewer will develop aad if also receiving probiotics.

TI  == pheromone-induced expression of recombinant proteins in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == a locus encoding proteins with high homology to the pneumococcal blpabchr quorum-sensing system was identified in streptococcus thermophilus lmg 18311. the blpabchr system regulates bacteriocin production in streptococcus pneumoniae by monitoring the extracellular concentration of a peptide-pheromone encoded by blpc. the homologous system in s. thermophilus, termed stbabchr, contains a corresponding gene (stbc) encoding a possible peptide-pheromone (stp) that presumably controls bacteriocin production in s. thermophilus. we synthesized this peptide and found that it activates transcription of a gusa reporter gene placed behind the promoter of the bacteriocin-like gene stbd. furthermore, deletion mapping and mutational analysis of the stbd promoter region were used to identify a degenerated direct repeat motif required for stp induced gusa expression. our findings provide strong evidence that stp regulates bacteriocin production in s. thermophilus lmg 18311, and show that the stbabchr quorum-sensing system can be exploited for inducible expression of recombinant proteins in this bacterial species.

TI  == accuracy of species identity of commercial bacterial cultures intended for probiotic or nutritional use.
AB  == independent studies have indicated that the microbiological composition of several commercial probiotic products does not correspond to the product label information. the present study set out to investigate to what extent these problems may be due to the use of misidentified cultures at the onset of production. for this purpose, 213 cultures of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and propionibacteria intended for probiotic or nutritional use were collected from 26 manufacturers of probiotic products, three international culture collections and  one research institute. the accuracy of the taxonomic identity provided by the strain depositor was assessed through a polyphasic approach based on validated and standardized identification methods including fluorescent amplified fragment  length polymorphism (faflp) and repetitive dna element (rep)-pcr fingerprinting,  protein profiling and partial 16s rdna sequencing. the majority of the cultures were received as members of the genera lactobacillus (57%) and bifidobacterium (22%); however, propionibacteria, enterococci, lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis), streptococcus thermophilus and pediococci were also obtained. upon reidentification, 46 cases of misidentification at the genus level (n=19) or species level (n=27) were recorded, including 34 commercial probiotic cultures deposited by 10 different companies. the finding that more than 28% of the commercial cultures intended for human and/or animal probiotic use were misidentified at the genus or species level suggests that many cases of probiotic product mislabeling originate from the incorporation of incorrectly identified strains. a large number of these discrepancies could be related to the use of methods with limited taxonomic resolution (e.g., api strips) or that are unsuitable for reliable identification up to species level (e.g., pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis). the current study has again highlighted that reliable identification of lab and propionibacteria requires molecular methods with a high taxonomic resolution that are linked to up-to-date identification libraries.

TI  == vsl#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve and b. infantis) and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == high genetic variability of the streptococcus thermophilus cse central part, a repeat rich region required for full cell segregation activity.
AB  == the cse gene of streptococcus thermophilus encodes an extracytoplasmic protein involved in cell segregation. the cse protein consists of two putative domains: a cell wall attachment lysm domain and a catalytic chap domain. these two domains are spaced by an interdomain linker, known as var-cse, previously reported to be  highly divergent between two s. thermophilus strains. the aim of this study was to assess the extent of this intraspecific variability and the functional involvement of the var-cse region in cell segregation. analysis of the var-cse sequence of 19 different strains allowed detection of 11 different alleles, varying from 390 bp to 543 bp, all containing interspersed and tandem nucleotides repeats. overall, 11 different repeat units were identified and some series of these small repeats, named supermotifs, form large repeats. results suggested that var-cse evolved by deletion of all or part of the repeats and by duplication of repeats or supermotifs. moreover, sequence analysis of the whole cse locus revealed that the cse orf is mosaic suggesting that var-cse polymorphism resulted from horizontal transfer. the partial deletion of the var-cse region of the s. thermophilus strain cnrz368 led to the lengthening of the number of cells per streptococcal chain, indicating that this region is required for full cell segregation in s. thermophilus strain cnrz368.

AB  == in this study, soymilk was first fermented with lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum) both individually and simultaneously. mutagenicity and the suppression of fermented soymilk against the mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide (4-nqo), a direct-acting mutagen, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (dmab), an indirect-acting mutagen, on salmonella typhimurium ta 100, was then investigated. it was found that the fermented soymilk shows no mutagenic activity on sal. typhimurium ta 100. fermentation, in general, significantly (p<0.05) enhanced the antimutagenicity of soymilk. the levels of increased antimutagenicity of fermented soymilk varied with the starter organism and the type of mutagen tested. although unfermented soymilk exerted lower antimutagenic activity against dmab than 4-nqo, the fermented soymilk, generally, showed a higher antimutagenic activity against dmab than 4-nqo. among the various fermented soymilk tested, soymilk fermented with both str. themophilus and b. infantis simultaneously exhibited the highest antimutagenicity of 85.07% and 85.78%, respectively, against 4-nqo and dmab further investigation on this fermented soymilk revealed that both the antimutagenic factors formed during fermentation and the cells of the starter organisms contributed to the increased antimutagenic activity against dmab, while the former led to the increased activity against 4-nqo.

TI  == beta-galactosidase production by streptococcus thermophilus is higher in the small intestine than in the caecum of human-microbiota-associated mice after lactose supplementation.
AB  == transit kinetics and survival rates of a bacterial species from yoghurt (i.e. streptococcus thermophilus strain fbi3) were examined in different digestive compartments of gnotoxenic and human-microbiota-associated mice. the production of the lactose-hydrolysing enzyme (i.e. beta-galactosidase) was also investigated within the digestive tract, using a chromosomal reporter system based on luciferase genes from photorhabdus luminescens under the control of the plac promoter. in both mice models, s. thermophilus cells transited within 2 h from the stomach to the caecum-colon compartment of the digestive tract where they displayed a survival rate of nearly 100 %. in gnotoxenic mice, luciferase activity was found to increase in the second half of the small intestine and in the caecum-colon compartment when lactose was added to the drinking water provided to the animals. in human-microbiota-associated mice drinking lactose, luciferase activity was similarly increased in the second half of the small intestine but was drastically reduced in the caecum-colon compartment. this feature could be ascribed to the presence of the resident human microbiota.

AB  == the formation of scfa in rats fed fermented oat fibre concentrates was compared with that of rats fed native oat fibre concentrate. the cultures used were lactic acid bacteria consisting of lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus (v2), the exopolysaccharide-producing strain pediococcus damnosus 2.6 (pd) and l. reuteri (lr). the materials were incorporated into test diets yielding a concentration of indigestible carbohydrates of 80 g/kg (dry weight). rats fed the v2-fermented fibre-concentrate diet yielded higher caecal and distal concentrations of acetic acid (p < 0.01) than rats fed the native fibre concentrate. all the fermented fibre concentrates resulted in a higher propionic  acid concentration in the distal colon (p < 0.05), while rats fed pd-fermented fibre concentrate resulted in lower concentration of butyric acid (p < 0.05, p <  0.01) in all parts of the hindgut as compared with rats fed the native fibre concentrates. butyrate concentrations ranged between 5-11 micromol/g (distal colon) and 6-8 micromol/g (13 d faeces). higher proportions of acetic acid (p < 0.05; p < 0.01) were observed in the caecum of rats fed the fermented fibre concentrates. rats fed pd- and lr-fermented fibre concentrates produced higher proportions of propionic acid (p < 0.05; p < 0.01) in the caecum. changes in scfa formation in the caecum, distal colon and faeces of rats fed the fermented samples compared with the native sample indicate that these microbes probably survive in the hindgut and that modification of the microflora composition with fermented foods is possible. this may be important for the gastrointestinal flora balance in relation to colonic diseases.

TI  == the complete genome sequence of lactobacillus bulgaricus reveals extensive and ongoing reductive evolution.
AB  == lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) is a representative of  the group of lactic acid-producing bacteria, mainly known for its worldwide application in yogurt production. the genome sequence of this bacterium has been  determined and shows the signs of ongoing specialization, with a substantial number of pseudogenes and incomplete metabolic pathways and relatively few regulatory functions. several unique features of the l. bulgaricus genome support the hypothesis that the genome is in a phase of rapid evolution. (i) exceptionally high numbers of rrna and trna genes with regard to genome size may  indicate that the l. bulgaricus genome has known a recent phase of important size reduction, in agreement with the observed high frequency of gene inactivation and elimination; (ii) a much higher gc content at codon position 3 than expected on the basis of the overall gc content suggests that the composition of the genome is evolving toward a higher gc content; and (iii) the presence of a 47.5-kbp inverted repeat in the replication termination region, an extremely rare feature  in bacterial genomes, may be interpreted as a transient stage in genome evolution. the results indicate the adaptation of l. bulgaricus from a plant-associated habitat to the stable protein and lactose-rich milk environment  through the loss of superfluous functions and protocooperation with streptococcus thermophilus.

AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented milk "laban".
AB  == the technological properties of 96 lactic acid bacteria isolated from lebanese traditional fermented milk "laban" were characterised. they were classified by phenotypic and biochemical analyses as streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, thus indicating that laban is a fermented milk similar to yogurt. most strains of l. bulgaricus (87.5%) exhibited a high acidification activity, whereas strains of streptococci showed low acidification ability. 33.3% of streptococci strains and 25% of lactobacilli strains displayed similar acidification performances as european strains. results obtained for syneresis, texture and rheological parameters led us to consider that isolated strains were not low polymer-producing strains. some of them displayed interesting characteristics such as low syneresis and high values for rheological parameters. the major flavour compounds found in pure cultures were acetaldehyde, acetone, 2-butanone, dimethyl disulfide, acetoin, 2,3-butanedione,  2,3-pentanedione, and acetic, hexanoic and butanoic acids. acetaldehyde (7.4%) and organic acids (48.3%) were mainly produced by l. bulgaricus strains, whereas  streptococci cultures contained high relative levels of 2,3-butanedione and acetoin, which represented around 82% of the total flavour compounds. finally, strains isolated from laban samples exhibited different technological properties  than those used in yogurt production, thus conferring specific characteristics to this product.

TI  == characterization of dominant microbiota of a ghanaian fermented milk product, nyarmie, by culture- and nonculture-based methods.
AB  == aims: to characterize the predominant micro-organisms in a ghanaian traditional fermented dairy product, nyarmie, made from cows' milk, using both culture- and nonculture-based methods. methods and results: samples of nyarmie were analysed from three production sites in accra, by determining the counts on selective culture media. the microbial diversity occurring in nyarmie was also evaluated by 16s/18s ribosomal dna pcr amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. results showed that nyarmie contained lactococci and lactobacilli in the range of 10(8) and 10(10) cfu ml(-1), respectively, and yeasts at around 10(7) cfu ml(-1). the ph ranged between 3.49 and 4.25. the predominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) in nyarmie were leuconostocmesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lact.helveticus, lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and lactococcus lactis, while saccharomyces cerevisiae was the predominant yeast species. lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. delbrueckii was not detected by cultivation but its predominance was revealed by pcr-dgge analysis. conclusions: the flora in products from different producers varied in the lab composition present and may result in variations in product quality. significance and impact of the study: development and use of starter cultures for nyarmie may be beneficial in improving the consistency of product quality.

TI  == the ltp gene of temperate streptococcus thermophilus phage tp-j34 confers superinfection exclusion to streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the ltp gene, located within the lysogeny module of temperate streptococcus thermophilus phage tp-j34, has been shown to be expressed in lysogenic strain s.  thermophilus j34. it codes for a lipoprotein, as demonstrated by inhibition of cleavage of the signal sequence by globomycin. exposure of ltp on the surface of  lactococcus lactis protoplasts bearing a plasmid-encoded copy of ltp has been demonstrated by immunogold labeling and electron microscopy. expression of ltp in prophage- and plasmid-cured s. thermophilus j34-6f interfered with tp-j34 infection. while plating efficiency was reduced by a factor of about 40 and lysis of strain j34-6f in liquid medium was delayed considerably, phage adsorption was  not affected at all. intracellular accumulation of phage dna was shown to be inhibited by ltp. this indicates interference of ltp with infection at the stage  of triggering dna release and injection into the cell, indicating a role of ltp in superinfection exclusion. expression of ltp in l. lactis bu2-60 showed that the same superinfection exclusion mechanism was strongly effective against phage  p008, a member of the lactococcal 936 phage species: no plaque-formation was detectable with even 10(9) phage per ml applied, and lysis in liquid medium did not occur. in lactococcus also, ltp apparently inhibited phage dna release and/or injection. ltp appears to be a member of a family of small, secreted proteins with a 42 amino acids repeat structure encoded by genes of gram-positive bacteria. some of these homologous genes are part of the genomes of prophages.

TI  == oral ingestion of streptococcus thermophilus diminishes severity of small intestinal mucositis in methotrexate treated rats.
AB  == background: currently, there are no available effective preventative or adjunctive agents to alleviate symptoms of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. this is compounded by the absence of a recognized and validated noninvasive biomarker  to assess gut function. this study investigated the effects of orally ingested streptococcus thermophilus (th-4) on chemotherapy-induced small intestinal damage in rats using the noninvasive (13)c-sucrose breath test (sbt). methods: gastrointestinal damage was induced in 27 female dark agouti rats (148 +/- 1g) with mtx (1.5 mg/kg; i.m.). rats received mtx or saline at 0 h; with daily treatment of: th-4 at doses of 10(9) (high), 10(8) (low) cfu/ml, or skim milk (vehicle), 48 h pre and 96 h post-mtx. the noninvasive (13)c-sucrose breath test  (sbt) was conducted at -24, 24 and 96 h post-mtx to monitor gut function. at sacrifice, small intestinal tissues were collected for determinations of sucrase  activity, myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity and histological assessment. results: mtx + vehicle and mtx + low th-4-treated rats produced significantly lower sbt and sucrase activity results compared to saline controls (p < 0.001). in contrast, mtx + high th-4 treatment showed no significant differences in the sbt  compared to saline controls, and the sbt results were significantly higher compared to mtx + vehicle and mtx + low th-4 (p < 0.05). mpo levels were significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in mtx + vehicle and mtx + low th-4, but not following mtx + high th-4 treatment, compared to saline controls. this was further confirmed by histological analyses. conclusion: oral ingestion of th-4 at 10(9) cfu/ml is capable of partially attenuating small bowel damage in rats. the  noninvasive sbt is a useful technique to longitudinally assess the efficacy of treatments or interventions for small bowel disease.

TI  == artisanal and experimental pecorino siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and pcr-dgge analyses.
AB  == traditional artisanal pecorino siciliano (ps) cheeses, and two experimental ps cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. the bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction  fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the 16s rrna gene to that of reference species. the culture-independent fingerprinting technique pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of v6 to v8 regions of the 16s rrna gene of samples taken during artisanal ps cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. the dominance of streptococcus bovis and lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal ps was revealed by 16s rrna gene sequencing. comparison of  dgge profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental ps cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional ps cheese.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus thermophilus host range phage mutants.
AB  == to investigate phage-host interactions in streptococcus thermophilus, a phage-resistant derivative (smq-301r) was obtained by challenging a tn917 library of phage-sensitive strain s. thermophilus smq-301 with virulent phage dt1. mutants of phages dt1 and md2 capable of infecting smq-301 and smq-301r were isolated at a frequency of 10(-6). four host range phage mutants were analyzed further and compared to the two wild-type phages. altogether, three genes (orf15, orf17, and orf18) contained point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions and were responsible for the expanded host range. these three proteins were also  identified in both phages by n-terminal sequencing and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. the results suggest that  at least three phage structural proteins may be involved in phage-host interactions in s. thermophilus.

TI  == a thermodynamic comparison of hpr proteins from extremophilic organisms.
AB  == a thermodynamic stability study of five histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (hpr) homologues derived from organisms inhabiting diverse environments is described. these hpr homologues are from bacillus subtilis (bs), streptococcus thermophilus (st), bacillus staerothermophilus (bst), bacillus halodurans (bh), and oceanobacillus iheyensis (oi). analyses of solvent and thermal denaturation experiments provide the cardinal thermodynamic parameters, like deltag, deltah, deltas, t(m), and deltac(p), that characterize the conformational stability for each homologue. the homologue from bacillus staerothermophilus (bsthpr) was established as the most thermostable homologue and also the homologue with highest deltag at all temperatures. a good correlation between habitat temperature of the organism and thermal stability of the protein is also seen. stability curves (deltag vs t) for every homologue are also reported; these reveal very similar deltac(p) and temperature of maximum stability (t(s)) values  for all hpr homologues. stability curves show that the higher thermal stability of some homologues is not a result of change in curvature of the curve or a shift to higher temperature, but rather a displacement of the stability curves to higher deltag values. stability curves also allowed estimation of deltag at habitat temperature of the organisms, and we find good agreement between homologues. electrostatic contributions to stability of each homologue were investigated by measuring stability as a function of varying ph and nacl concentration, and our results suggest that most hpr homologues share similar electrostatic contributions to stability.

TI  == cultivability of streptococcus thermophilus in grana padano cheese whey starters.
AB  == the application of a culture-independent approach, that of reverse transcriptase-length heterogeneity-pcr coupled with epifluorescence microscopy, allowed us to observe that streptococcus thermophilus is metabolically active, but only partially cultivable in grana padano cheese whey starters. a short preincubation of the starters in sterile skimmed whey was followed by cultivation in sterile skimmed whey-enriched m17. this procedure restored the cultivability of s. thermophilus and enabled us to detect s. thermophilus at ranges (10(7)-10(8) cfu ml(-1)) which have rarely been reported in these cultures. the use of cheese whey as a cultivation-revitalization substrate can be useful to obtain an unbiased picture of the microbial composition of whey starters for grana padano cheese, thus avoiding an underestimation of s. thermophilus in these cultures.

TI  == probiotics and commensals reverse tnf-alpha- and ifn-gamma-induced dysfunction in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == background & aims: commensal bacteria are crucial for the development of the mucosal immune system. probiotics are commensals with special characteristics and may protect mucosal surfaces against pathogens. pathogens cause significant phenotypic alterations in infected epithelial cells, and probiotics reverse these deleterious responses. we hypothesized that probiotics and/or commensals may also reverse epithelial damage produced by cytokines. methods: human intestinal epithelial cells were exposed basolaterally to interferon (ifn)-gamma (10(3) u/ml) or tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha (10 ng/ml) for up to 48 hours and assessed for ion transport, transepithelial resistance (ter), and epithelial permeability in the presence or absence of probiotics (streptococcus thermophilus [st] and lactobacillus acidophilus [la]), or the commensal, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (bt). results: agonist-stimulated chloride secretion was inhibited by ifn-gamma, an effect prevented by st/la or bt. the ability of st/la  or bt to restore cl(-) secretion was blocked by inhibitors of p38 mapk, erk1, 2,  and pi3k. the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) and the  nkcc1 cotransporter were down-regulated by ifn-gamma, and st/la pretreatment reversed this effect. both tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma significantly reduced ter and  increased epithelial permeability, effects prevented by st/la or bt. a janus kinase (jak) inhibitor synergistically potentiated effects of st/la or bt on ter  and permeability, but p38, erk1, 2, or pi3k inhibition did not. finally, only probiotic-treated epithelial cells exposed to cytokines showed reduced activation of socs3 and stat1,3. conclusions: deleterious effects of tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma on epithelial function are prevented by probiotic, and to a lesser extent, commensal pretreatment. these data extend the spectrum of effects of such bacteria on intestinal epithelial function and may justify their use in inflammatory disorders.

TI  == expression of the heat shock gene clpl of streptococcus thermophilus is induced by both heat and cold shock.
AB  == background: heat and cold shock response are normally considered as independent phenomena. a small amount of evidence suggests instead that interactions may exist between them in two lactococcus strains. results: we show the occurrence of molecular relationships between the mechanisms of cold and heat adaptations in streptococcus thermophilus, a lactic acid bacterium widely used in dairy fermentation, where it undergoes both types of stress. we observed that cryotolerance is increased when cells are pre-incubated at high temperature. in addition, the production of a protein, identified as clpl, a member of the heat-shock atpase family clp a/b, is induced at both high and low temperature. a  knock-out clpl mutant is deficient in both heat and cold tolerance. however lack  of production of this protein does not abolish the positive effect of heat pre-treatment towards cryotolerance. conclusion: dual induction of clpl by cold and heat exposure of cells and reduced tolerance to both temperature shocks in a  clpl mutant indicates that the two stress responses are correlated in s. thermophilus. however this protein is not responsible by itself for cryotolerance of cells pre-treated at high temperature, indicating that clpl is necessary for the two phenomena, but does not account by itself for the relationships between them.

AB  == the primary purpose of this research was to monitor the influence of acacia honey addition to yogurt milk on survival of the microbial flora of yogurt during refrigerated storage for 6 wk. results showed that the presence of honey at 1.0%  to 5.0% (w/v) did not significantly influence (p>0.05) the viability of characteristic microorganisms (i.e., streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) in yogurt during storage at 4 degrees c. similarly, honey had no effect on ph and lactic acid levels of the final products. despite these findings, enrichment of yogurt with honey is recommended  because honey is a natural sweetener that possesses a wide range of beneficial nutritional properties. in addition, at a rate of approximately 3.0% (w/v), it highly improves the sensory quality of the finished product without having a detrimental effect on characteristic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == food commensal microbes as a potentially important avenue in transmitting antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  == the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant (art) pathogens is a major threat to  public health. while the surfacing of art food-borne pathogens is alarming, the magnitude of the antibiotic resistance (ar) gene pool in food-borne commensal microbes is yet to be revealed. incidence of art commensals in selected retail food products was examined in this study. the presence of 10(2)-10(7) cfu of art  bacteria per gram of foods in many samples, particularly in ready-to-eat, 'healthy' food items, indicates that the art bacteria are abundant in the food chain. ar-encoding genes were detected in art isolates, and streptococcus thermophilus was found to be a major host for ar genes in cheese microbiota. lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc sp. isolates were also found carrying ar genes. the data indicate that food could be an important avenue for art bacterial evolution and dissemination. ar-encoding plasmids from several food-borne commensals were transmitted to streptococcus mutans via natural gene transformation under laboratory conditions, suggesting the possible transfer of ar genes from food commensals to human residential bacteria via horizontal gene transfer.

AB  == we investigated the adaptation to milk of streptococcus thermophilus lmg18311 using a proteomic approach. two-dimensional electrophoresis of cytosolic proteins were performed after growth in m17 medium or in milk. a major modification of the proteome concerned proteins involved in the supply of amino acids, like the peptidase pepx, and several enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis. in parallel, we observed the upregulation of the synthesis of seven enzymes directly involved in the synthesis of purines, as well as formyl-tetrahydrofolate (thf) synthetase and serine hydroxy-methyl transferase, two enzymes responsible for the synthesis of compounds (thf and glycine, respectively) feeding the purine biosynthetic pathway. the analysis also revealed a massive increase in the synthesis of pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl), the enzyme which converts pyruvate into acetyl coenzyme a and formate. pfl has been essentially studied for its role in mixed-acid product formation in lactic acid bacteria during anaerobic fermentation. however, formate is an important methyl group donor for anabolic pathway through the formation of folate derivates. we hypothesized that pfl was involved in purine biosynthesis during growth in milk. we showed that pfl expression was regulated at the transcriptional level and that pfl transcription  occurred during the exponential growth phase in milk. the complementation of milk with formate or purine bases was shown to reduce pfl expression, to suppress pfl  synthesis, and to stimulate growth of s. thermophilus. these results show a novel regulatory mechanism controlling the synthesis of pfl and suggest an unrecognized physiological role for pfl as a formate supplier for anabolic purposes.

TI  == the activity of the lactose transporter from streptococcus thermophilus is increased by phosphorylated iia and the action of beta-galactosidase.
AB  == the metabolism of lactose by streptococcus thermophilus is highly regulated, allowing the bacterium to prefer lactose over glucose as main source of carbon and energy. in vitro analysis of the enzymes involved in transport and hydrolysis of lactose showed that the transport reaction benefits from the hydrolysis of lactose at the trans side of the membrane. furthermore, the activity of lacs is modulated by pep-dependent phosphorylation of the iia domain via the general energy coupling proteins of the pts, enzyme i and hpr. to determine whether unphosphorylated lacs-iia inhibited, or the phosphorylated form stimulated lactose counterflow, a lacs-iia truncation mutant of lacs was constructed. detailed analyses of transport in whole cells and in proteoliposomes indicated that unphosphorylated lacs-iia does not functionally interact with the carrier domain. instead, interaction of the phosphorylated form of lacs-iia with the carrier stimulates lactose counterflow transport. the proposed mode of regulation thus proceeds via a mechanism opposite to the inducer exclusion type of regulation in gram-negative bacteria, where transporters are inhibited by binding of the unphosphorylated form of iia(glc).

TI  == effects of exopolysaccharide-producing cultures on the viscoelastic properties of reduced-fat cheddar cheese.
AB  == the objective was to study the influence of different exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing and nonproducing lactic cultures on the viscoelastic properties of reduced-fat cheddar cheese. changes in the viscoelastic properties were followed over a ripening period of 6 mo. results showed that the elastic, viscous, and complex moduli were higher in reduced-fat cheeses made with eps-nonproducing cultures than in full-fat cheese. no differences in the viscoelastic properties were found between young reduced-fat cheese made with a ropy strain of lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (jfr1) and its full-fat counterpart. interestingly, the changes in viscoelastic moduli in both full-fat cheese and reduced-fat cheese made with jfr1 during ripening followed the same pattern. whereas the moduli increased during the first month of ripening in those 2 cheeses, a dramatic decrease was observed in all other cheeses. slopes of the viscoelastic moduli as a function of frequency were lower in the full-fat than in reduced-fat cheeses. the creep test showed that fresh reduced-fat cheese made with jfr1 was less rigid and more deformable than that made with eps-nonproducing cultures. the creep and recovery properties of young reduced-fat cheese made with jfr1 and the full-fat type were similar. no differences were found in the viscoelastic properties between reduced-fat cheese made with no eps and those made with eps-producing adjunct cultures of streptococcus thermophilus. after 6 mo of ripening, cheeses made with eps-producing cultures maintained lower elastic and viscous moduli than did those made with no eps.

TI  == application of exopolysaccharide-producing cultures in reduced-fat cheddar cheese: composition and proteolysis.
AB  == proteolysis during ripening of reduced fat cheddar cheeses made with different exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing and nonproducing cultures was studied. a ropy strain of lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (jfr1) and capsule-forming nonropy and moderately ropy strains of streptococcus thermophilus were used in making reduced-fat cheddar cheese. commercial cheddar starter was used in making full-fat cheese. results showed that the actual yield of cheese made with jfr1 was higher than that of all other reduced-fat cheeses. cheese made with jfr1 contained higher moisture, moisture in the nonfat substance, and residual coagulant activity than all other reduced-fat cheeses. proteolysis, as determined by page and the level of water-soluble nitrogen, was also higher in cheese made with jfr1 than in all other cheeses. the hplc analysis showed a significant increase in hydrophobic peptides (causing bitterness) during storage of cheese made with jfr1. cheese made with the capsule-forming nonropy adjunct of s. thermophilus, which contained lower moisture and moisture in the nonfat substance levels and lower chymosin activity than did cheese made with jfr1, accumulated less hydrophobic peptides. in conclusion, some eps-producing cultures produced reduced-fat cheddar cheese with moisture in the nonfat substance similar to that  in its full-fat counterpart without the need for modifying the standard cheese-making protocol. such cultures might accumulate hydrophobic (bitter) peptides if they do not contain the system able to hydrolyze them. for making high quality reduced-fat cheddar cheese, eps-producing cultures should be used in conjunction with debittering strains.

AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is a gram-positive bacterium belonging to the group of lactic acid bacteria, among which several genera play an essential role in manufacture of food products. recently, a genomic consortium sequenced and annotated its entire genome, which has been demonstrated to contain 1900 coding sequences. in this study, we have revealed the expression products of almost 200  different genes using a proteomic strategy combining 2-de plus maldi-tof pmf and  differential 1-de plus mulc-esi-it-ms/ms. thus, a number of cellular pathways related to important physiological processes were described at the proteomic level. almost 50 genes were related to multiple electrophoretic species, whose heterogeneity was mainly due to variability in pi values. a 2-de reference map obtained for lactose-grown cells was compared with those obtained after heat, cold, acid, oxidative and starvation stresses. protein up/down-regulation measurements demonstrated that adaptation to different environmental challenges may involve the contribution of unique as well as combined physiological mechanisms. common regulatory sites in the promoter region of genes whose expression was induced after stress were identified. these results provide a better comprehension of biochemical processes related to stress resistance in s.  thermophilus, allowing defining the molecular bases of adaptative responses or markers for the identification of strains with potential industrial applications.

AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria on the formation of conjugated linoleic acid (cla), microbial growth, and organoleptic attributes (acidity, texture, and flavor) of fermented milk products was determined. four probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus rhamnosus, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 56, p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 51, and p. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 23, were evaluated individually or in coculture with traditional yogurt cultures  (lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus). the lipid source was hydrolyzed soy oil. l. rhamnosus, in coculture with yogurt culture, resulted in the highest content of cla. growth and cla formation of propionibacteria were enhanced in the presence of yogurt cultures. texture and flavor attributes of fermented milks produced with propionibacteria were significantly different than the fermented milks processed  with yogurt cultures. the fermented milks processed with probiotic bacteria in coculture with yogurt cultures demonstrated similar acidity, texture, and flavor  as the fermented milk produced with yogurt cultures.

TI  == bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus secretion products enhance t helper 1 immune response and intestinal barrier in mice.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria or their secretion products can modulate immune responses differently in normal and inflammatory conditions. this comparative study analyzes the effect of oral administration of living lactic acid bacteria, or their conditioned media, on the epithelial and immune functions of colitis-prone  c57bl/6 il-10-deficient mice. mice were untreated (control) or infected with helicobacter hepaticus with or without oral treatment with living bacteria, bifidobacterium breve c50 and streptococcus thermophilus 065 (lb), or their culture-conditioned media (cm). histology, cytokine mrna, electrical resistance,  and barrier capacity of colonic samples as well as cytokine secretion by mesenteric lymph node (mln) cells were studied. helicobacter hepaticus mice developed only mild colitis, which was not modified in lb or cm groups. in the cm (but not the lb) group, the colonic barrier was reinforced as compared to the other groups, as evidenced by decreased horseradish peroxidase (hrp) transcytosis and mannitol fluxes and increased electrical resistance. in mln, the percentage of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells secreting ifngamma was significantly higher in cm (2.06% and 1.98%, respectively) mice than in h. hepaticus (1.1% and 0.47%, p < 0.05) or  control mice. in addition, the nonspecific stimulation of ifngamma, tnfalpha, and il-12 secretion by mln cells was significantly higher in the cm group as compared to the other groups. in the absence of severe colitis, bifidobacterium breve c50- and streptococcus thermophilus 065-conditioned media can reinforce intestinal barrier capacity and stimulate th1 immune response, highlighting the involvement  of lactic acid bacteria-derived components in host defense.

TI  == effects of specific lactic acid bacteria on the intestinal permeability to macromolecules and the inflammatory condition.
AB  == non-live probiotic bacteria and their fermentation products can be used in milk-based formula intended for healthy infants. the effects of a milk formula fermented with bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus and heated/dehydrated to inactivate the micro-organisms have been reported over the last few years to decrease the intestinal permeability to macromolecules in experimental animals in vivo and more recently to down-regulate inflammatory condition in vitro. feeding guinea-pigs with such dehydrated fermented milk reinforced the intestinal barrier resistance to food proteins (hrp, beta-lactoglobulin). in addition, the products secreted by bacteria were capable  of inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced tnf-alpha secretion by human peripheral mononuclear blood cells. the active secretion products were resistant  to digestive enzymes and their anti-inflammatory properties were preserved after  transepithelial transport across the filter-grown intestinal epithelial cell line, especially in inflammatory conditions. the binding of lps to monocytes as well as nfkappab nuclear translocation leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription were inhibited by bacteria-culture supernatants. conclusion: b. breve and s. thermophilus used as non-live micro-organisms in fermented infant formula seem to induce a reduction in macromolecular absorption and release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect, which persists after intestinal transport. thus, specific lactic acid bacteria and their metabolites seem to affect positively the intestinal function.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == detection and characterization of streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages by use of the antireceptor gene sequence.
AB  == in the dairy industry, the characterization of streptococcus thermophilus phage types is very important for the selection and use of efficient starter cultures.  the aim of this study was to develop a characterization system useful in phage control programs in dairy plants. a comparative study of phages of different origins was initially performed based on their morphology, dna restriction profiles, dna homology, structural proteins, packaging mechanisms, and lifestyles and on the presence of a highly conserved dna fragment of the replication module. however, these traditional criteria were of limited industrial value, mainly because there appeared to be no correlation between these variables and host ranges. we therefore developed a pcr method to amplify vr2, a variable region of  the antireceptor gene, which allowed rapid detection of s. thermophilus phages and classification of these phages. this method has a significant advantage over  other grouping criteria since our results suggest that there is a correlation between typing profiles and host ranges. this association could be valuable for the dairy industry by allowing a rational starter rotation system to be established and by helping in the selection of more suitable starter culture resistance mechanisms. the method described here is also a useful tool for phage  detection, since specific pcr amplification was possible when phage-contaminated  milk was used as a template (detection limit, 10(5) pfu ml(-1)).

AB  == objectives: supplementation of probiotics and supplementation of zinc during acute gastroenteritis in children have been shown to exert positive effects on diarrhea duration and severity. our aim was to evaluate a new diet enriched with  zinc and probiotic bacteria in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in young children. methods: in a double blind prospective study, 65 children aged 6-12 months were randomized to receive 6 x 10(9) colony forming units of streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) of each strain), 10 mg of zinc/day, and 0.3 grams of fructo-oligosaccharides in the  supplemented group (n = 33) or placebo (n = 32), given in a soy protein based rice cereal. for each child, age, sex, weight, degree of dehydration, the presence of fever or vomiting, stool frequency and consistency were recorded daily until diarrhea resolution. results: diarrhea resolution occurred after 1.43 +/- 0.71 days in the supplemented group vs. 1.96 +/- 1.24 in the control group (p = 0.017). in the subset of children who presented with vomiting, time to vomiting resolution was 0.27 +/- 0.59 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.91 days in the supplemented and control groups, respectively (p = 0.06). on day 3, there was only 1 child with watery stools in the supplemented group versus 10 children in the control group (p = 0.02). conclusions: in our series, the feeding of a cereal containing streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus and zinc, reduced the severity and duration of acute gastroenteritis in young children. however, whether this combination is better than either the addition of probiotics or zinc alone is yet to be determined.

AB  == objective: to test the hypothesis that normalizing the intestinal flora by administration of prophylactic probiotics would provide a natural defense, thereby reducing both the incidence and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in preterm neonates. study design: neonates < or =1500 g birth weight were  randomized to either receive a daily feeding supplementation with a probiotic mixture (bifidobacteria infantis, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacteria  bifidus; solgar, israel) of 10(9) colony forming units (cfu)/day or to not receive feed supplements. nec was graded according to bell's criteria. results: for 72 study and 73 control infants, respectively, birth weight (1152 +/- 262 g vs 1111 +/- 278 g), gestational age (30 +/- 3 weeks vs 29 +/- 4 weeks), and time  to reach full feeds (14.6 +/- 8.7 days vs 17.5 +/- 13.6 days) were not different. the incidence of nec was reduced in the study group (4% vs 16.4%; p=.03). nec was less severe in the probiotic-supplemented infants (bell's criteria 2.3 +/- 0.5 vs 1.3 +/- 0.5; p=.005). three of 15 babies who developed nec died, and all nec-related deaths occurred in control infants. conclusion: probiotic supplementation reduced both the incidence and severity of nec in our premature neonatal population.

TI  == new insights in the molecular biology and physiology of streptococcus thermophilus revealed by comparative genomics.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is a major dairy starter used for the manufacture of yoghurt and cheese. the access to three genome sequences, comparative genomics and multilocus sequencing analyses suggests that this species recently emerged and is still undergoing a process of regressive evolution towards a specialised bacterium for growth in milk. notably, s. thermophilus has maintained a well-developed nitrogen metabolism whereas its sugar catabolism has been subjected to a high level of degeneracy due to a paucity of carbon sources in milk. furthermore, while pathogenic streptococci are recognised for a high capacity to expose proteins at their cell surface in order to achieve cell adhesion or to escape the host immune system, s. thermophilus has nearly lost this unique feature as well as many virulence-related functions. although gene decay is obvious in s. thermophilus genome evolution, numerous small genomic islands, which were probably acquired by horizontal gene transfer, comprise important industrial phenotypic traits such as polysaccharide biosynthesis, bacteriocin production, restriction-modification systems or oxygen tolerance.

TI  == use of a probiotic to decrease enteric hyperoxaluria.
AB  == background: patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states. endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary  oxalate absorption. methods: ten patients were studied with chronic fat malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by  jejunoileal bypass (1) and roux-en-y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4), dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). for 3 months, patients received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (oxadrop), vsl pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. twenty-four-hour urine collections were performed at baseline and after each month. results: mean urinary oxalate excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, p < 0.05), and oxalate excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, p < 0.05). during the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment. urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. calcium oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on oxadrop, largely due to the decrease in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical significance. conclusion: manipulation of gastrointestinal (gi) flora can influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels. these changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. further studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.

TI  == clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (crisprs) have spacers of extrachromosomal origin.
AB  == numerous prokaryote genomes contain structures known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crisprs), composed of 25-50 bp repeats separated by unique sequence spacers of similar length. crispr structures are found in the vicinity of four genes named cas1 to cas4. in silico analysis revealed another cluster of three genes associated with crispr structures in many bacterial species, named here as cas1b, cas5 and cas6, and also revealed a certain number of spacers that have homology with extant genes, most frequently derived from phages, but also derived from other extrachromosomal elements. sequence analysis of crispr structures from 24 strains of streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus vestibularis confirmed the homology of spacers with extrachromosomal elements. phage sensitivity of s. thermophilus strains appears to be correlated with the number of spacers in the crispr locus the strain carries. the authors suggest that the spacer elements are the traces of past invasions by extrachromosomal elements, and hypothesize that they provide the cell immunity against phage infection, and more generally foreign dna expression, by coding an anti-sense rna. the presence of gene fragments in crispr structures and the nuclease motifs in cas genes of both cluster types suggests that crispr formation involves a dna degradation step.

AB  == a screen of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria identified streptococcus thermophilus strain st110 as the putative producer of a bacteriocin with high level of activity against pediococci. thermophilin 110 was isolated from culture  supernatant after 16 h of growth and partially purified by a chloroform extraction procedure. the bacteriocin inhibited the growth of several lactic acid bacteria and in the case of pediococcus acidilactici, it induced cell lysis with  the concomitant release of od260-absorbing material and intracellular enzymes. sds-page analysis revealed two components with estimated sizes between 4.0 kda and 4.5 kda, respectively, with possible involvement in bacteriocin activity as indicated by agar overlay assays with p. acidilactici as the target organism. thermophilin 110 was inactivated by several proteolytic enzymes and also by alpha-amylase, which indicated the putative requirement of a glycosidic component for activity. the bacteriocin produced by s. thermophilus may be especially useful in the food processing industries to control spoilage caused by pediococci.

TI  == molecular and biochemical analysis of the galactose phenotype of dairy streptococcus thermophilus strains reveals four different fermentation profiles.
AB  == lactose-limited fermentations of 49 dairy streptococcus thermophilus strains revealed four distinct fermentation profiles with respect to galactose consumption after lactose depletion. all the strains excreted galactose into the  medium during growth on lactose, except for strain imdost40, which also displayed extremely high galactokinase (galk) activity. among this strain collection eight  galactose-positive phenotypes sensu stricto were found and their fermentation characteristics and leloir enzyme activities were measured. as the gal promoter seems to play an important role in the galactose phenotype, the galr-galk intergenic region was sequenced for all strains yielding eight different nucleotide sequences (ns1 to ns8). the gal promoter played an important role in the gal-positive phenotype but did not determine it exclusively. although galt and gale activities were detected for all gal-positive strains, galk activity could only be detected for two out of eight gal-positive strains. this finding suggests that the other six s. thermophilus strains metabolize galactose via an alternative route. for each type of fermentation profile obtained, a representative strain was chosen and four complete leloir gene clusters were sequenced. it turned out that gal-positive strains contained more amino acid differences within their gal genes than gal-negative strains. finally, the biodiversity regarding lactose-galactose utilization among the different s. thermophilus strains used in this study was shown by rapd-pcr. five gal-positive  strains that contain nucleotide sequence ns2 in their galr-galk intergenic region were closely related.

TI  == use of an alpha-galactosidase gene as a food-grade selection marker for streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the alpha-galactosidase gene (aga) of lactococcus raffinolactis atcc 43920 was previously shown to be an efficient food-grade selection marker in lactococcus lactis and pediococcus acidilactici but not in streptococcus thermophilus. in this study, we demonstrated that the alpha-galactosidase of l. raffinolactis is thermolabile and inoperative at 42 degrees c, the optimal growth temperature of s. thermophilus. an in vitro assay indicated that the activity of this alpha-galactosidase at 42 degrees c was only 3% of that at 30 degrees c, whereas  the enzyme retained 23% of its activity at 37 degrees c. transformation of strep. thermophilus rd733 with the shuttle-vector pnz123 bearing the aga gene of l. raffinolactis (praf301) generated transformants that were stable and able to grow on melibiose and raffinose at 37 degrees c or below. the transformed cells possessed 6-fold more alpha-galactosidase activity after growth on melibiose than cells grown on lactose. slot-blot analyses of aga mrna indicated that repression  by lactose occurred at the transcriptional level. the presence of praf301 did not interfere with the lactic acid production when the transformed cells of strep. thermophilus were grown at the optimal temperature in milk. using the recombinant plasmid praf301, which carries a chloramphenicol resistance gene in addition to aga, we showed that both markers were equally efficient at differentiating transformed from nontransformed cells. the aga gene of l. raffinolactis can be used as a highly efficient selection marker in strep. thermophilus.

TI  == glutamine synthesis is essential for growth of streptococcus thermophilus in milk and is linked to urea catabolism.
AB  == growth of a glutamine synthetase-deficient mutant of streptococcus thermophilus was compared to that of the parent strain in milk that was not supplemented or was supplemented with ammonium chloride, glutamine, or the urease inhibitor flurofamide. it was concluded that one of the functions of urease is to supply ammonia for the synthesis of glutamine.

TI  == functional interactions between the subunits of the lactose transporter from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == although the quaternary state has been assessed in detail for only a few members  of the major facilitator superfamily (mfs), it is clear that multiple oligomeric  states are represented within the mfs. one of its members, the lactose transporter lacs from streptococcus thermophilus assumes a dimeric structure in the membrane and in vitro analysis showed functional interactions between both subunits when proton motive force ((delta)p)-driven transport was assayed. to study the interactions in further detail, a covalent dimer was constructed consisting of in tandem fused lacs subunits. these covalent dimers, composed of active and completely inactive subunits, were expressed in escherichia coli, and  initial rates of (delta)p-driven lactose uptake and lactose counterflow were determined. we now show that also in vivo, both subunits interact functionally; that is, partial complementation of the inactive subunit was observed for both transport modes. thus, both subunits interact functionally in (delta)p-driven uptake and in counterflow transport. in addition, analysis of in tandem fused lacs subunits containing one regulatory lacs-iia domain showed that regulation is primarily an intramolecular event.

TI  == effect of fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria in the prevention of an enteroinvasive escherichia coli infection in mice.
AB  == this study investigated the protective capacity of the oral administration of fermented milk containing the probiotic strains; lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, against enteroinvasive escherichia coli infection in a murine (balb/ c mice) model. mice  were fed for 2, 5 or 7 consecutive days with fermented milk diluted to a concentration of viable lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and strep. thermophilus of 10(7) cfu/ml. phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages and the number of iga+ cells in small and large intestine were determined at the end  of the feeding periods. for the preventive effect against esch. coli, animals were fed for 5 days (selected dose). mice were challenged with an infective dose  of enteroinvasive esch. coli of 10(8) cfu/mouse. the colonization of liver and spleen and the secretory iga specific for the pathogen in the intestinal fluid were determined (elisa test). results showed that the unspecific immune response  enhanced itself after 5 consecutive days of the administration of this fermented  milk (increase in the percentage of phagocytosis and number of iga+ cells in the  small intestine). treated animals showed less esch. coli colonization of liver than control mice and a higher secretory anti-esch. coli iga in the intestinal fluids. these results suggest that the protection against enteroinvasive esch. coli infection observed for the fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria may  be associated with an enhance of the intestinal mucosa immunity.

TI  == low-fat mozzarella as influenced by microbial exopolysaccharides, preacidification, and whey protein concentrate.
AB  == low-fat mozzarella cheeses containing 6% fat were made by preacidification of milk, preacidification combined with exopolysaccharide- (eps-) producing starter, used independently or as a coculture with non-eps starter, and preacidification combined with whey protein concentrate (wpc) and eps. the impact of these treatments on moisture retention, changes in texture profile analysis, cheese melt, stretch, and on pizza bake performance were investigated over 45 d of storage at 4 degrees c. preacidified cheeses without eps (control) had the lowest moisture content (53.75%). these cheeses were hardest and exhibited greatest springiness and chewiness. the meltability and stretchability of these cheeses increased most during the first 28 d of storage. the moisture content in cheeses  increased to 55.08, 54.79, and 55.82% with eps starter (containing 41.18 mg/g of  eps), coculturing (containing 28.61 mg/g of eps), and wpc (containing 44.23 mg/g  of eps), respectively. exopolysaccharide reduced hardness, springiness, and chewiness of low-fat cheeses made with preacidified milk in general and such cheeses exhibited an increase in cohesiveness and meltability. although stretch distance was similar in all cheeses, those containing eps were softer than the control. cocultured cheeses exhibited the greatest meltability. cheeses containing wpc were softest in general; however, hardness remained unchanged over 45 d. cheeses made with wpc had the least increase in meltability over time. incorporation of wpc did not reduce surface scorching or increase shred fusion of cheese shreds during pizza baking; however, there was an improvement in these properties between d 7 and 45. coating of the cheese shreds with oil was necessary for adequate browning, melt, and flow characteristics in all cheese types.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == use of probiotics in children with acute diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics, defined as microbial cell preparations or components of microbial cells that have a beneficial effect on the health and well being of the host, have traditionally been used to treat and prevent a variety of infections. beneficial effects of probiotics in acute infectious diarrhea in children seem to be: (i) moderate; (ii) strain-dependent; (iii) dose dependent; (iv) significant in watery diarrhea and viral gastroenteritis, but non-existent in invasive, bacterial diarrhea; and (v) more evident when treatment with probiotics is initiated early in the course of disease. three large, randomized controlled trials (rcts) provide evidence of a very modest effect (statistically significant, but of questionable clinical importance) of some probiotic strains (lactobaccillus gg, lactobaccillus reuteri, bifodobacterium lactis) on the prevention of community-acquired diarrhea. we have found conflicting evidence from four rcts on the efficacy of lactobacillus gg and b. bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus in the prevention of nosocomial diarrhea in children.  two rcts in children provide evidence of a moderate beneficial effect of lactobacillus gg in the prevention of antibacterial-associated diarrhea (aad), but results in adults are conflicting. data on the efficacy of other probiotic strains in aad in children are very limited. in conclusion, to date, the most extensively studied and best documented clinical application of probiotics in children is for the treatment of acute watery diarrhea of rotaviral or presumably viral etiology. studies documenting effects in other types of diarrheal diseases  in children are limited, although some preliminary results are promising. the effects of different probiotic microorganisms are not equal. only very few probiotic strains have been tested rigorously in rcts. many questions remain to be answered. future clinical trials should evaluate carefully selected, precisely defined probiotic strains and address clinically important endpoints.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium gm-1 isolated  from an infant.
AB  == aim: to partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the gm-1 strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. methods and results: the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium gm-1 showed a broad spectrum  of activity against indicator strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio spp., salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. treatment of the gm-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. the bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees c for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral ph. the optimal production of bacteriocin from e. faecium gm-1 was obtained when  the culture conditions were ph 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees c. the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. the use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. a bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin p was identified from the total dna of e. faecium gm-1 by pcr and direct sequencing methods. conclusion: e. faecium gm-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin p-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. significance and impact of the study: e. faecium gm-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin p. this bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [evaluation of the effect of probiotic cultures on two different yogurt brands over a known population of staphylococcus aureus and the production of thermonuclease].
AB  == the effect of probiotic cultures over known populations of staphylococcus aureus  inoculated in yogurt was studied; also the production and stability of its thermonuclease during yogurt storage was evaluated. in three different occasions, two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (lactobacillus casei and l. acidophilus), were inoculated with known populations  of s. aureus in high and low concentration (10(9) cfu/g and 10(7) cfu/g), respectively. these samples were stored for 28 days at 5 degrees c. every four days the count of lactic bacteria, s. aureus and ph were evaluated, according to  the methodology described in the compendium of methods for the microbiological examination of foods, vanderzant & splittstoesser. the presence of thermonuclease was determined using petrifilm for s. aureus from 3m company. the ph and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period. yogurt with additional probiotic cultures (high and low concentration) lowered the population of s. aureus to non detectable levels in 8 days; but, s. aureus could be cultured from yogurt without probiotics even after 24 days of incubation. same time, the presence of thermonuclease was positive in all tests; it was not affected by probiotics. the presence of thermonuclease is related to the production of s. aureus enterotoxin. this work emphasizes again the beneficial effects of probiotic cultures in yogurt over bacteria and the importance of keeping hygienic practices in order to avoid the contamination of food with s. aureus and the eventual production of its enterotoxin, since it is not affected by probiotics.

TI  == cse, a chimeric and variable gene, encodes an extracellular protein involved in cellular segregation in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the isolation of a streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 mutant displaying a long-chain phenotype allowed us to identify the cse gene (for cellular segregation). the n terminus of cse exhibits high similarity to streptococcus agalactiae surface immunogenic protein (sip), while its c terminus exhibits high  similarity to s. thermophilus pcsb. in cnrz368, deletion of the entire cse open reading frame leads to drastic lengthening of cell chains and altered colony morphology. complementation of the deltacse mutation with a wild-type allele restored both wild-type phenotypes. the central part of cse is a repeat-rich region with low sequence complexity. comparison of cse from cnrz368 and lmg18311  strains reveals high variability of this repeat-rich region. to assess the impact of this central region variability, the central region of lmg18311 cse was exchanged with that of cnrz368 cse. this replacement did not affect chain length, showing that divergence of the central part does not modify cell segregation activity of cse. the structure of the cse locus suggests that the chimeric organization of cse results from insertion of a duplicated sequence deriving from the pcsb 3' end into an ancestral sip gene. thus, the cse locus illustrates the module-shuffling mechanism of bacterial gene evolution.

TI  == sequence heterogeneity in the lacsz operon of streptococcus thermophilus and its  use in pcr systems for strain differentiation.
AB  == sequences of the lacsz operon of 29 streptococcus thermophilus strains from different dairy products were determined. differences in sequence among the strains were detected within lacs more often than in the lacz gene. the sequences were aligned and compared and it was possible to gather the strains into three groups of similarity on the basis of the lacs gene sequence. the dairy environment of origin did not seem to be related to the lacsz operon sequence and thus to the similarity shown. nucleotide variability was investigated and a total of 139 nucleotide changes were found in the lacs gene while 40 nucleotide changes were found in the sequences of the lacz gene. moreover, the influence of the nucleotide changes on the amino acid sequence of the lacs transporter and of the  beta-galactosidase enzyme were discussed. sequence variability within the region  upstream from the lacs gene was used to develop group-specific pcr systems capable of distinguishing s. thermophilus at the strain level. a strain-specific  primer set was designed allowing the specific detection of 11 out of 29 strains of s. thermophilus. moreover, lacs-pcr-sscp analysis of the 29 strains provided 2 different profiles, whereas 4 strain-specific profiles were detected by lacs-pcr-dgge, indicating the potential to use these techniques for profiling and monitoring population of strains of s. thermophilus in food products. the results are discussed with reference to the potential of these pcr methods for ascertaining strain dominance and starter fitness in dairy processes.

TI  == the doubly phosphorylated form of hpr, hpr(ser~p)(his-p), is abundant in exponentially growing cells of streptococcus thermophilus and phosphorylates the  lactose transporter lacs as efficiently as hpr(his~p).
AB  == in streptococcus thermophilus, lactose is taken up by lacs, a transporter that comprises a membrane translocator domain and a hydrophilic regulatory domain homologous to the iia proteins and protein domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts). the iia domain of lacs (iialacs) possesses a histidine residue that can be phosphorylated by hpr(his~p), a protein component of the pts. however, determination of the cellular levels of  the different forms of hpr, namely, hpr, hpr(his~p), hpr(ser-p), and hpr(ser-p)(his~p), in exponentially lactose-growing cells revealed that the doubly phosphorylated form of hpr represented 75% and 25% of the total hpr in s.  thermophilus atcc 19258 and s. thermophilus smq-301, respectively. experiments conducted with [32p]pep and purified recombinant s. thermophilus atcc 19258 proteins (ei, hpr, and iialacs) showed that iialacs was reversibly phosphorylated by hpr(ser-p)(his~p) at a rate similar to that measured with hpr(his~p). sequence analysis of the iialacs protein domains from several s. thermophilus strains indicated that they can be divided into two groups on the basis of their amino acid sequences. the amino acid sequence of iialacs from group i, to which strain  19258 belongs, differed from that of group ii at 11 to 12 positions. to ascertain whether iialacs from group ii could also be phosphorylated by hpr(his~p) and hpr(ser-p)(his~p), in vitro phosphorylation experiments were conducted with purified proteins from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975, which possesses a iialacs very similar to group ii s. thermophilus iialacs. the results indicated that s. salivarius iialacs was phosphorylated by hpr(ser-p)(his~p) at a higher rate than that observed with hpr(his~p). our results suggest that the reversible  phosphorylation of iialacs in s. thermophilus is accomplished by hpr(ser-p)(his~p) as well as by hpr(his~p).

TI  == characterization of the cro-ori region of the streptococcus thermophilus virulent bacteriophage dt1.
AB  == the virulent cos-type streptococcus thermophilus phage dt1 was previously isolated from a mozzarella whey sample, and its complete genomic sequence is available. the putative ori of phage dt1 is characterized by three inverted and two direct repeats located in a noncoding region between orf36 and orf37. as the  replication ability of the putative ori and flanking genes could not be established, its ability to confer phage resistance was tested. when ori is cloned on a high-copy-number plasmid, it provides protection to s. thermophilus strains against phage infection during milk fermentation. this protection is phage specific and strain dependent. then, a detailed transcriptional map was established for the region located between the cro-like gene (orf29) and the ori. the results of the northern blots indicated that the transcription of this region started 5 min after the onset of phage infection. comparative analysis of the expression of the cro-ori region in the three s. thermophilus cos-type phages dt1, sfi19 (virulent), and sfi21 (temperate) reveals significant differences in the number and size of transcripts. the promoter upstream of orf29 was further investigated by primer extension analysis, and its activity was confirmed by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, which showed that the phage promoter is  more efficient than the constitutive bacterial promoter of the s. thermophilus operon encoding the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. however, the phage promoter is less efficient than the pts promoter in lactococcus lactis and in escherichia coli.

TI  == recombinant production of serine hydroxymethyl transferase from streptococcus thermophilus and its preliminary evaluation as a biocatalyst.
AB  == the glya gene encoding a serine hydroxymethyl transferase (shmt) with threonine aldolase activity was isolated from streptococcus thermophilus yka-184 chromosomal dna. this aldolase is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme that  stereospecifically catalyzes the interconversion of l-threonine to glycine and acetaldehyde. the enzyme was overexpressed in escherichia coli m15 as a recombinant protein of 45 kda with a his6-tag at its n-terminus. the recombinant  enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a single chromatographic step using ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity, obtaining a high activity-recovery yield (83%). lyophilized and precipitated enzymes were stable at least for 10 weeks when stored at -20 degrees c and 4 degrees c. it was observed that the km for l-allo-threonine was 38-fold higher than that for l-threonine, suggesting this enzyme can be classified as a specific l-allo-threonine aldolase. the optimum ph  range of threonine aldolase activity for the recombinant shmt was ph 6-7. when tested for aldol addition reactions with non-natural aldehydes, such as benzyloxyacetaldehyde and (r)-n-cbz-alaninal, two possible beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acid diastereoisomers were produced, but with moderate stereospecificity. the enzyme showed potential as a biocatalyst for the stereoselective synthesis of beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acids.

TI  == molecular identification of monomeric aspartate racemase from bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum is a useful probiotic agent exhibiting health-promoting properties and contains d-aspartate as an essential component of the cross-linker moiety in the peptidoglycan. to help understand d-aspartate biosynthesis in b. bifidum nbrc 14252, aspartate racemase, which catalyzes the racemization of d- and l-aspartate, was purified to homogeneity and characterized. the enzyme was a  monomer with a molecular mass of 27 kda. this is the first report showing the presence of a monomeric aspartate racemase. its enzymologic properties, such as its lack of cofactor requirement and susceptibility to thiol-modifying reagents in catalysis, were similar to those of the dimeric aspartate racemase from streptococcus thermophilus. the monomeric enzyme, however, showed a novel characteristic, namely, that its thermal stability significantly increased in the presence of aspartate, especially the d-enantiomer. the gene encoding the monomeric aspartate racemase was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli cells. the nucleotide sequence of the aspartate racemase gene encoded a peptide containing 241 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 26 784 da. the recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity and its properties were almost the same as those of the b. bifidum enzyme.

TI  == the relevance of genetic analysis to dairy bacteria: building upon our heritage.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are essential for the manufacture of fermented dairy products. studies on the physiology, biochemistry and genetics of these microorganisms over the last century have contributed considerably to the improvement of fermentation processes and have resulted in better and safer products. nevertheless, the potential of lab is far from being maximized. the sophistication of biotechnologies and the availability of complete genome sequences have opened the door to the metabolic engineering of lab. in this regard, the recent publication of the complete genome sequences of two streptococcus thermophilus strains will provide a key tool to facilitate the genetic manipulation of this important dairy species.

TI  == fermentation conditions affecting the bacterial growth and exopolysaccharide production by streptococcus thermophilus st 111 in milk-based medium.
AB  == aims: to study the effect of different fermentation conditions and to model the effect of temperature and ph on different biokinetic parameters of bacterial growth and exopolysaccharides (eps) production of streptococcus thermophilus st 111 in milk-based medium. methods and results: the influence of temperature and ph was studied through fermentation and modelling. fermentations under non-ph controlled conditions with s. thermophilus st 111 indicated that the eps production was low in milk medium, even if additional nitrogen sources were supplemented. under ph-controlled conditions, addition of whey protein hydrolysate to the milk medium resulted in a fivefold increase of the eps production. this medium did not contain polysaccharides interfering with eps isolation. primary and secondary modelling of different fermentations revealed an optimum temperature and ph of 40 degrees c and constant ph 6.2, respectively, for growth in milk medium supplemented with whey protein hydrolysate. maximum eps production was observed in the range of 32-42 degrees c and constant ph 5.5-6.6.  whereas growth and maximum eps production were clearly influenced by temperature  and ph, the specific eps production was only affected by stress conditions (t = 49 degrees c). conclusions: addition of whey protein hydrolysate to milk medium resulted in an increased growth and eps production of s. thermophilus st 111 under ph-controlled conditions. a modelling approach allowed studying the influence of temperature and ph on the kinetics of both growth and eps production. significance and impact of the study: the use of an appropriate milk-based medium and a combined model of temperature and ph can be of practical  importance for the production of yoghurt or other fermented milks as well as for  process optimization of the large-scale production of starter strains to be used  for their eps production.

TI  == complete sequence and comparative genome analysis of the dairy bacterium streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus is widely used for the manufacture of yogurt and cheese. this dairy species of major economic importance is phylogenetically close to pathogenic streptococci, raising the possibility that it has a potential for virulence. here we report the genome sequences of two yogurt strains of s. thermophilus. we found a striking level of gene decay (10% pseudogenes) in both microorganisms. many genes involved in carbon utilization are nonfunctional, in line with the paucity of carbon sources in milk. notably, most streptococcal virulence-related genes that are not involved in basic cellular processes are either inactivated or absent in the dairy streptococcus. adaptation to the constant milk environment appears to have resulted in the stabilization of the genome structure. we conclude that s. thermophilus has evolved mainly through loss-of-function events that remarkably mirror the environment of the dairy niche resulting in a severely diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  == molecular quantification of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk products using real-time quantitative pcr.
AB  == real-time quantitative pcr assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of lactic acid bacteria (lab) (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus and l. johnsonii) in fermented milk products. the results of molecular quantification and classic bacterial enumeration did not differ significantly with respect to s. thermophilus and the species of the l. casei group which were detected in the six commercial fermented products tested, thus showing that dna extraction was efficient and that genomic dna solutions were free of pcr inhibitors. for l. delbrueckii, the results of bacterial enumeration were generally lower by a factor 10 to 100 than those of pcr quantification, suggesting a loss of viability during storage of the dairy products at 1-8 degrees c for most of the strains in  this species. real-time quantitative assays enabled identification of the species of lactic acid bacterial strains initially present in commercial fermented milk products and their accurate quantification with a detection threshold of 10(3) cells per ml of product.

TI  == in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli isolated from commercial products containing active lactobacilli.
AB  == to survey the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of some commercially available lactobacillus, we collected four commercial products that contain active lactobacillus. we incubated individual product and identified these colonies by the methods of api50 ch test kit and rapid id 32a kit. strains of streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei were collected. by agar dilution method, each identified strain was inoculated to brucella blood agar-mic plates. each plate contained one of the following antibiotics with different concentrations: amoxicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, vancomycin, erythromycin, rifampin, tetracyclin and penicillin g, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, cefmetazole, metronidazole, ampicillin/sulbactum, cefoxtin, etc. after incubation, the growth condition of each brucella blood agar-mic plate was observed and the breakpoint of each antibiotic to different lactobacillus products determined. the mics of amoxicillin, ampicillin/sulbactum and penicillin-g to all identified strains were < or =2 microg/ml and those of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, cefmetazole and cefoxtin for l. casei were >32 microg/ml. l. casei was more resistant to all the testing antibiotics than the other strains. according to the mics of the above antibiotics, proper active lactobacillus products could be chosen to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the pediatric field.

TI  == probiotics enhance the recovery of gut atrophy in experimental malnutrition.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of probiotics on the recovery of the bowel atrophy induced by malnutrition in rats. methods: twenty-and-six wistar rats (200-250g) were fed with either a normoproteic (sham group, n=6) or a free-protein diet (n=20) during 12 days. twelve malnourished rats were randomized to recover during 15 days with either a hydrolyzed diet (control group, n=6) or the same diet enriched with probiotics (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus; probiotic group, n=6). results: probiotic group showed similar gain of body, liver and bowel weight than controls. at the jejunum, both the villus height (383+/-49 vs. 321+/-46mm; p=0.04) and crypt depth (157+/-31 vs. 125+/-10mm; p=0.04) were greater in probiotic group than in controls. the crypt depth at the cecum (214+/-22 vs. 169+/-43 mm; p=0.05) and the wall width at both the cecum (410+/-18 vs. 340+/-61  mm; p=0.02) and sigmoid (479+/-130 vs. 330+/-62 mm; p=0.03) were higher in probiotic than in control group. conclusion: streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus enhance the recovery of gut atrophy induced by malnutrition. probiotics can be useful as oral adjuvants during the recovery of malnutrition.

TI  == selection and properties of streptococcus thermophilus mutants deficient in urease.
AB  == natural variations of the urea content of milk have a detrimental effect on the regularity of acidification by streptococcus thermophilus strains used in dairy processes. the aim of the present study was to select urease-deficient mutants of s. thermophilus and to investigate their properties. using an improved screening  medium on agar plates, mutants were selected from 4 different parent strains after mutagen treatment and by spontaneous mutation. most mutants were stable and had a phage sensitivity profile similar to that of their parent strain. some of them contained detrimental secondary mutations, as their acidifying activity was  lower than that of the parent strain cultivated in the presence of the urease inhibitor flurofamide. the proportion of this type of mutant was much lower among spontaneous mutants than among mutants selected after mutagen treatment. utilization of urease-deficient mutants in dairy processes may have several advantages, such as an increase in acidification, an improved regularity of acidification, and a lower production of ammonia in whey.

AB  == during industrial processes, the dairy organism streptococcus thermophilus is exposed to stress conditions. its ability to survive and grow in an aerobic environment indicates that it must possess defensive mechanisms against reactive  oxygen species. to identify the genes involved in oxidative stress defence, a collection of mutants was generated by random insertional mutagenesis and screened for menadione sensitivity and resistance. results obtained for resistant clones allowed the identification of eight loci. the insertions affected genes whose homologues in other bacteria were previously identified as being involved in stress response(deob, gst) or transcription regulation (rggc) and five orfs of unknown function. the tolerance of the eight mutants to air-exposure, methyl viologen and h2o2 was studied. real-time quantitative pcr was used to analyse the transcript level of mutated genes and revealed that most were down-regulated during oxidative stress.

AB  == streptococcus thermophilus inia 463 became nisin-resistant after exposure in skim milk to subminimal inhibitory concentrations of nisin (1-3 iu/ml) for less than 2 h. addition of 20 iu/ml caused a 4 log unit decrease in s. thermophilus counts of a culture not exposed previously to nisin, whereas no decrease was observed in the culture exposed to nisin for 2 h. transfer of immunity genes as responsible for nisin resistance was discarded. the presence of extracellular or intracellular specific nisin-degrading enzymes was not detected in the nisin-resistant variant of s. thermophilus inia 463. nisin resistance was caused  by the induction of a resistance mechanism. transmission electron microscopy (tem) revealed that the nisin-resistant variant of s. thermophilus inia 463 had a thickened cell wall compared to the wild strain. resistance to nisin was lost after one transfer (4 h growth) in nisin-free skim milk.

AB  == quantification of water-soluble volatile free fatty acids (ffa) and free amino acids (faa) was performed as a ripening index and an indirect measure of flavor development in swiss-type cheeses. the objective of this research was to assess the effect of warm room treatment (wrt) and usage ratio of starter cultures, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus vs. propionibacteria, on  the concentration of ffa and faa in pilot plant-scale swiss cheese. a capillary gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector was used for the analysis of ffa in swiss cheese. free amino acids were analyzed by the cd-ninhydrin method. starter culture ratios did not affect development of faa during the cheese ripening. however, duration of wrt had an effect on the concentration of faa in the swiss cheese. free amino acids increased considerably during wrt. a continuous increase in faa was shown during 70-d ripening time after wrt. the concentrations of c2:0 and c3:0 fatty acids were affected by starter culture ratios after 2-wk wrt, but these differences had mostly disappeared after 3-wk wrt. similar concentrations of ffa and faa reported in previous studies were developed in swiss cheese with a 3-wk wrt and a 0.33:1 ratio of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus to propionibacteria.

TI  == atomic force microscopic corroboration of bond aging for adhesion of streptococcus thermophilus to solid substrata.
AB  == initial bacterial adhesion is considered to be reversible, but over time the adhesive bond between a bacterium and a substratum surface may strengthen, turning the process into an irreversible state. microbial desorption has been studied in situ in controlled flow devices as a function of the organisms resident time on the surface (j. colloid interface sci. 164 (1994) 355). it appeared that desorption of streptococcus thermophilus decreased strongly within  approximately 50 s after initial adhesion due to bond aging. in this paper, bond  aging between the s. thermophilus cell surface and the silicon nitride tip of an  afm (atomic force microscope) is corroborated microscopically and related to the  macroscopic, residence time-dependent desorption of the organism under flow. afm  indicated bond strengthening between the tip and the cell surface within 100 s of contact, which is on the same order of magnitude as bond aging inferred from residence time-dependent desorption. comparison of the interaction energies derived from afm and macroscopic desorption indicate that bond strengthening arises as a result of multiple attachments of extracellular polymeric substances  to a substratum surface.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == characterization of a galactokinase-positive recombinant strain of streptococcus  thermophilus.
AB  == the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus is widely used by the dairy  industry for its ability to transform lactose, the primary sugar found in milk, into lactic acid. unlike the phylogenetically related species streptococcus salivarius, s. thermophilus is unable to metabolize and grow on galactose and thus releases substantial amounts of this hexose into the external medium during  growth on lactose. this metabolic property may result from the inability of s. thermophilus to synthesize galactokinase, an enzyme of the leloir pathway that phosphorylates intracellular galactose to generate galactose-1-phosphate. in this work, we report the complementation of gal(-) strain s. thermophilus smq-301 with s. salivarius galk, the gene that codes for galactokinase, and the characterization of recombinant strain smq-301k01. the recombinant strain, which  was obtained by transformation of strain smq-301 with ptrkl2tk, a plasmid bearing s. salivarius galk, grew on galactose with a generation time of 55 min, which was almost double the generation time on lactose. data confirmed that (i) the ability of smq-301k01 to grow on galactose resulted from the expression of s. salivarius  galk and (ii) transcription of the plasmid-borne galk gene did not require galr,  a transcriptional regulator of the gal and lac operons, and did not interfere with the transcription of these operons. unexpectedly, recombinant strain smq-301k01 still expelled galactose during growth on lactose, but only when the amount of the disaccharide in the medium exceeded 0.05%. thus, unlike s. salivarius, the ability to metabolize galactose was not sufficient for s. thermophilus to simultaneously metabolize the glucose and galactose moieties of lactose. nevertheless, during growth in milk and under time-temperature conditions that simulated those used to produce mozzarella cheese, the recombinant gal(+) strain grew and produced acid more rapidly than the gal(-) wild-type strain.

AB  == the role of the enzymes uridine-5'-diphospho-(udp) glucose pyrophosphorylase and  udp galactose 4-epimerase in exopolysaccharide production of gal- ropy and non-ropy strains of streptococcus thermophilus in a batch culture was investigated. growth of the ropy and non-ropy strains was accompanied by total release of the galactose moiety from lactose hydrolysis in modified bellinker broth with lactose as the only carbon source. this was associated with a greater  exopolysaccharide production by the ropy strain. the polymer produced by both strains in cultures with lactose or glucose as carbon sources contained glucose,  galactose and rhamnose, indicating that glucose was used as a carbon source for bacterial growth and for exopolysaccharide formation. udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity was associated with polysaccharide production during the first 12 h in a 20 h culture in the ropy strain, but not in the non-ropy strain. udp-galactose 4-epimerase was not associated with exopolysaccharide synthesis in any strain. the evidence presented suggests that the glucose moiety  from lactose hydrolysis is the source of sugar for heteropolysaccharide synthesis, due to a high udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity.

AB  == although a large number of key odorants of swiss-type cheese result from amino acid catabolism, the amino acid catabolic pathways in the bacteria present in these cheeses are not well known. in this study, we compared the in vitro abilities of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus to produce aroma compounds from three amino acids, leucine, phenylalanine, and methionine, under mid-ph conditions of cheese ripening (ph 5.5), and we investigated the catabolic pathways used by these bacteria. in the three lactic acid bacterial species, amino acid catabolism was initiated by a transamination step, which requires the presence of an alpha-keto  acid such as alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-kg) as the amino group acceptor, and produced alpha-keto acids. only s. thermophilus exhibited glutamate dehydrogenase activity, which produces alpha-kg from glutamate, and consequently only s. thermophilus was capable of catabolizing amino acids in the reaction medium without alpha-kg addition. in the presence of alpha-kg, lactobacilli produced much more varied aroma compounds such as acids, aldehydes, and alcohols than s. thermophilus, which mainly produced alpha-keto acids and a small amount of hydroxy acids and acids. l. helveticus mainly produced acids from phenylalanine and leucine, while l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis produced larger amounts of alcohols and/or aldehydes. formation of aldehydes, alcohols, and acids from alpha-keto acids by l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis mainly results from the action of an alpha-keto acid decarboxylase, which produces aldehydes that are then oxidized or reduced to acids or alcohols. in contrast, the enzyme involved in the alpha-keto acid conversion to acids in l. helveticus and s. thermophilus is an alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase that produces acyl coenzymes a.

TI  == antigenotoxicity of probiotics and prebiotics on faecal water-induced dna damage  in human colon adenocarcinoma cells.
AB  == six strains of lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) were incubated (1 x 10(8)cfu/ml) with genotoxic faecal water from a human subject. ht29 human adenocarcinoma cells were then challenged with the resultant samples and dna damage measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. the lab  strains investigated were bifidobacterium sp. 420, bifidobacterium bb12, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus and enterococcus faecium. dna damage was significantly decreased by all bacteria used with the exception of strep. thermophilus. bif. bb12 and lact. plantarum showed the greatest protective effect against dna damage. incubation of faecal water with different concentrations of bif. bb12 and lact. plantarum revealed that the  decrease in genotoxicity was related to cell density. non-viable (heat treated) probiotic cells had no effect on faecal water genotoxicity. in a second study, ht29 cells were cultured in the presence of supernatants of incubations of probiotics with various carbohydrates including known prebiotics; the ht29 cells  were then exposed to faecal water. overall, incubations involving lact. plantarum with the fructooligosaccharide (fos)-based prebiotics inulin, raftiline, raftilose and actilight were the most effective in increasing the cellular resistance to faecal water genotoxicity, whereas fermentations with elixor (a galactooligosaccharide) and fibersol (a maltodextrin) were less effective. substantial reductions in faecal water-induced dna damage were also seen with supernatants from incubation of prebiotics with bif. bb12. the supernatant of fermentations involving ent. faecium and bif. sp. 420 generally had less potent effects on genotoxicity although some reductions with raftiline and elixor fermentations were apparent.

TI  == effect of the metabolism of urea on the acidifying activity of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == one of the main functions of streptococcus thermophilus strains used in the dairy industry is the production of lactic acid. in cheese and fermented milk manufacturing processes, the ph evolution kinetics must be reproducible in order  to ensure the good quality of the final products. the objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of the metabolism of urea on the acidifying activity of fast- and slow-acidifying strains of s. thermophilus. milk treatment  with a purified urease and utilization of the urease inhibitor flurofamide revealed that urea metabolism by s. thermophilus influences the ph evolution kinetics through 2 distinct means. first, ammonia production from urea tends to increase the ph. this effect is greater when lactic acid concentration is low due to a lower buffering capacity of milk. second, urea metabolism also modifies growth and lactic acid production by s. thermophilus. depending on the strains and the growth stage of the cultures, consumption of urea induces either a faster or a slower ph decrease. for the slow-acidifying strain rd678, suppression of urea metabolism by adding flurofamide decreased the time necessary to reach ph 6  by 195 min. this effect was less pronounced for the 2 fast-acidifying strains rd674 and rd677. these results show that urea metabolism may have a considerable  influence on the acidifying properties of s. thermophilus strains.

TI  == survey of bacterial proteins released in cheese: a proteomic approach.
AB  == during the ripening of emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. in emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters  like lactobacillus helveticus, lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as propionibacterium freudenreichii. the aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a  reference map. a methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of  cheese matrix prior to 2d-page analysis. the aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) dna and rna repair and (v) oxidoreduction. the results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria  and propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening. different peptidases arose from st thermophilus and lb helveticus, suggesting that streptococci are involved in peptide degradation in addition to the proteolytic activity of lactobacilli.

TI  == probiotics reduce the cd34+ hemopoietic precursor cell increased traffic in allergic subjects.
AB  == an increased traffic of circulating cd34+ hemopoietic precursors cells (hpc) is an important feature of systemic allergic inflammation. bacteria and bacterial products are capable of stimulating the transcription of the maturational cytokines il12 and ifns through the activation of toll-like-receptor and the subsequent nuclear translocation of the nf-kappab factor. in this study the probiotics differentiation/maturational effect potential on cd34+ hpc has been investigated. fourteen consecutive subjects, 9m and 5f, aged 6-48, with clinical  symptoms of asthma and /or conjunctivitis, rhinitis, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and irritable bowel syndrome were enrolled. allergen-specific serum ige were found in twelve patients. flow-cytometric measurement of peripheral blood cd34dim/bright hpc values were assessed before and after 30 days of therapy, consisting in the oral administration of one sachet a day of endolac (ucb pharma, turin, italy). each sachet contained a mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. delbrueckii and streptococcus thermophilus for a total of 1 x 10(9) live bacteria. circulating cd34+ cell values significantly (p  < 0.001) reduced after the treatment. endolac, thus, may improve the efficacy of  the standard treatments of allergic diseases.

TI  == temperature step changes: a novel approach to control biofilms of streptococcus thermophilus in a pilot plant-scale cheese-milk pasteurisation plant.
AB  == a pilot plant-scale cheese-milk pasteurisation plant was designed and constructed to study the development of biofilms of streptococcus thermophilus during pasteurisation of milk, and to investigate methods for preventing this growth from occurring. under base run conditions, s. thermophilus grew on surfaces in the cool-down sections of the pilot plant, between 50 and 35 degrees c (bulk milk temperature), and could be detected in the product stream after 8-10 h production, reaching levels of 10(6) cfu ml-1 after 16 h. thermoduric bacteria also grew in the heating sections of the pilot plant, although to a lesser extent, as did non-thermoduric bacteria that originated in the raw milk. the novel application of temperature step changes, implemented periodically to the growth region of s. thermophilus, successfully controlled the development of biofilms of these organisms. the growth of bacteria on the heating side of the pilot plant was also prevented by the implementation of these same step changes.  the optimum step change conditions required to achieve a 20-h production run without detectable growth of s. thermophilus comprised a step change to 55 degrees c, applied for 10 min, with a 60-min interval between step changes.

TI  == assessment of enzymatic cleaning agents and disinfectants against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == purpose: microbial biofilm has become difficult to control by antibiotic and biocide regimes that are effective against suspended bacteria. their colonization of surfaces can be a problem and is generally controlled through cleaning and disinfection. this study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of the disinfectants including bio-ow, econase ce, gamanase gc 140, indiage 44l, mannanase amb, multifect p-3000, neutrase, pandion, paradigm, pectinex ultra sp-l, promozyme, resinase a2x, spezyme aa300, spezyme ga300 and vinozym ec, and the proteinase against bacterial biofilms. methods: the effectiveness of 20 commercial disinfectants against pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) biofilms  using a fluorometric technique was examined. additionally the disinfectants were  also tested against lactobacillus bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus), lactobacillus lactis (l. lactis) and streptococcus thermophilus (s. thermophilus) isolates using microtitration tray based turbidimetric techniques. escherichia coli (e. coli) was used as the test bacteria in the fluorometric control method. results:  among the first group of the enzymatic cleaning agents tested, four disinfectants (pandion, resinase a2x, spezyme ga300 and paradigm) were the most potent against  bacterial biofilms after 30 min incubation time (residual bacterial count less than 10(3) cfu (colony forming units)/ml). however, only resinase a2x and paradigm showed a good effect on bacterial biofilms after 15 min incubation time. proteinase disinfectants (alkalase, chymotrypsin, cryotin and krilltrypsin) from  the second group of the disinfectants showed a good effect against p. aeruginosa  biofilm when tested in the absence of milk. the performance of the disinfectants  was reduced in the presence of milk. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the cleaning agents was determined as the lowest concentration inhibiting bacterial growth. the mic was tested on lactobacillus bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus), lactobacillus lactis (l. lactis) and streptococcus thermophilus (s. thermophilus) isolates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) for paradigm against s. thermophilus and l. lactis were lower than l. bulgaricus. whereas, the mic of pandion against l. bulgaricus was lower than mic against l. lactis. resinase a2x  had no inhibitory effect on bacterial growth when the concentration was less than or equal to 2.4 mg/ml and spezyme ga 300 concentration less than or equal to 7.3  mg/ml. minimum inhibitory concentration of pandion against l. bulgaricus was 2.7  microg/ml and against l. lactis 5.3 microg/ml. growth of s. thermophilus was inhibited in all concentration of pandion tested. conclusions: the choice of disinfectant or cleaning agent along with the optimum concentration and the time  of action is very important when destroying microbes. it is also important that the resistances of microbes to different disinfectants and cleaning agents be taken into account when planning the cleaning process

TI  == lactic acid bacteria secrete metabolites retaining anti-inflammatory properties after intestinal transport.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria have a beneficial effect on intestinal inflammation. in this study, we have examined the effect of lactic acid and commensal gram positive (+) bacteria conditioned media (cm) on tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) release and the mechanisms involved. methods: lipopolysaccharide (lps) induced tnf-alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the thp-1 cell line was monitored in the presence or absence of bacteria cm obtained from two probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve (bb) and streptococcus thermophilus (st), and three commensal bacterial strains (bifidobacterium bifidum, ruminococcus gnavus, and unidentified streptococcus). bb and st bacteria cm were allowed to cross filter grown intestinal epithelial cell monolayers (ht29-19a) to assess intestinal transport of active bacterial products. these products were characterised and their effect on lps binding to thp-1 cells and nuclear factor kappa b (nf kappa b) activation assessed. results: dose dependent inhibition of lps induced tnf-alpha secretion was noted for both probiotic bacteria cm (64% and 71% inhibition for bb and st, respectively) and to a lesser extent commensal bacteria cm (21-32% inhibition). active products from bb and st were resistant to digestive enzymes and had a molecular mass <3000 da.  their inhibitory effect was preserved after transepithelial transport across intestinal cell monolayers, mainly in inflammatory conditions. lps-fitc binding to thp-1 cells and nf kappa b activation were significantly inhibited by bb and st cm. conclusion: b breve and s thermophilus release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect capable of crossing the intestinal barrier. commensal bacteria also display a tnf-alpha inhibitory capacity but to a lesser extent. these results underline the beneficial effect of commensal bacteria in intestinal homeostasis and may explain the role of some probiotic bacteria in alleviating digestive inflammation.

TI  == viability of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in fermented soymilk after drying, subsequent rehydration and storage.
AB  == to develop a probiotic dietary adjunct, soymilk fermented with various combinations of lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium infantis) was subjected to freeze-drying and spray-drying. survival of the starter organisms during the drying process, subsequent rehydration at different temperatures and during a 4-month period of storage under different storage conditions was examined. after freeze-drying, lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria exhibited a survival percent of 46.2-75.1% and 43.2-51.9%, respectively, higher than that noted after spray-drying. regardless of the drying condition, s. thermophilus showed a higher percentage of survival than l. acidophilus, while b. longum survived better than b. infantis. further study with soymilk fermented with s. thermophilus and b. longum revealed that the freeze-dried and spray-dried fermented soymilk rehydrated at 35-50 degrees c and  20 degrees c, respectively, was optimum for the recovery of the starter organisms. both s. thermophilus and b. longum survived better in the freeze-dried than the spray-dried fermented soymilk during storage. a higher percent of survival was also noted for both the starter organisms when the dried fermented soymilk was stored at 4 degrees c than 25 degrees c. holding the dried fermented  soymilk in the laminated pouch enabled s. thermophilus and b. longum to exhibit a higher percentage of survival than in the deoxidant- and desiccant-containing glass or polyester (pet) bottle. among all the packaging materials and storage temperatures tested, starter organisms were most stable in the dried fermented soymilk held in laminated pouch and stored at 4 degrees c. under this storage condition, s. thermophilus and b. longum showed a survival percentage of 51.1% and 68.8%, respectively, in the freeze-dried fermented soymilk after 4 months of  storage. meanwhile, s. thermophilus and b. infantis in the spray-dried fermented  soymilk showed a survival percent of 29.5% and 57.7%, respectively.

TI  == indigenous raw milk microbiota influences the bacterial development in traditional cheese from an alpine natural park.
AB  == nostrano di primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the paneveggio-pale di san martino natural park area in the italian dolomites. in summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, passo rolle and vanoi, in the paneveggio natural park. during the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. the microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by rapd analysis and identified by 16s rrna sequence. the milk of the passo rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly lactococcus  lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei.  the plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. the dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. the vanoi cheese was dominated by enterococcus faecium and streptococcus macedonicus  in the first two days and mesophilic 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. in the first few days, the rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic s. macedonicus and s. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. during ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. the taxonomical identification by 16s rrna sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of s. macedonicus, lactobacillus plantarum, 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum and e. faecium were detected in both cheeses.

TI  == probiotics enhance recovery from malnutrition and lessen colonic mucosal atrophy  after short-term fasting in rats.
AB  == objective: we investigated the effects of probiotics on nutritional status and gut mucosal atrophy after fasting. methods: twelve rats were fasted for 3 d and then fed with rat chow (control group, n = 6) or an isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diet containing probiotics (probiotics group, n = 6; 10(6) colony-forming units/g of bifidobacterium lactis bl and streptococcus thermophilus) for 3 d. twelve other rats were starved for 3 d (starved group) or  normally fed with rat chow (sham group). at the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected for total protein and albumin analyses, and the colonic mucosa was weighed (in grams) and assayed for dna content (milligrams per gram of tissue). results: feeding efficiency was greater in the probiotic group than in the control and sham groups (p < 0.01). animals in the probiotic group presented  higher albumin than did those in the control group (p = 0.04). colonic mucosa of  the sham group (1.32 [range, 1.28-1.44]) was heavier than that of all other groups (probiotic, 1.20 [0.95-1.49], p = 0.03; control, 1.09 [0.96-1.21], p < 0.01; and starved, 1.03 [0.99-1.07], p < 0.01) and heavier in the probiotic than  in the starved group (p = 0.03). the dna content in probiotic rats (49.1 +/- 9.7) was similar to that in sham rats (53.9 +/- 5.9; p = 0.79) and higher than that in control (30.3 +/- 12.9; p = 0.01) and starved (34.4 +/- 6.5; p = 0.05) rats. conclusions: probiotics enhance the recovery of nutritional status and lessen gut mucosal atrophy after fasting.

TI  == evolution of genomic islands by deletion and tandem accretion by site-specific recombination: icest1-related elements from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the 34 734-bp integrative and potentially conjugative element (putative ice) icest1 has been previously found to be site-specifically integrated in the 3' end of the fda locus of streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368. four types of genomic islands related to icest1 are integrated in the same position in seven other strains of s. thermophilus. one of these elements, icest3, harbours conjugation and recombination modules closely related to those of icest1 and excises by site-specific recombination. two other types of elements, cime19258 and cime302,  are flanked by site-specific attachment sites closely related to attl and attr of icest1 and icest3, whereas delta cime308 only possesses a putative attr site; none of these three elements carry complete conjugation and recombination modules. icest1 contains a functional internal recombination site, attl', that is almost identical to attl of cime19258. the recombination between attl' and attr of icest1 leads to the excision of the expected circular molecule (putative ice); a cis-mobilizable element (cime) flanked by an attl site and an attb' site remains integrated into the 3' end of fda. furthermore, sequences that could be truncated att sites were found within icest1, icest3 and cime302. all together, these data suggest that these genomic islands evolved by deletion and tandem accretion of ices and cimes resulting from site-specific recombination. a model for this evolution is proposed and its application to other genomic islands is discussed.

AB  == the objective of this research was to determine the effect of exopolysaccharide (eps) production by lactic acid bacteria on the microstructure and rheology of karish cheese, a soft acid coagulated cheese made using skim milk. an eps-producing strain of streptococcus thermophilus, and its eps non-producing genetic variant were used to make comparable batches of the cheese. eps in cheese was visualized by cryo-sem as a large, dense, filamentous mass. cheese made with  the eps non-producing culture was characterized by a dense protein network with smaller pores compared to that prepared with the eps-producing culture. high elastic and viscous moduli measured by dynamic rheology were observed for eps negative cheese and was attributed to its dense protein network. creep test experiments demonstrated that cheese prepared with the eps non-producing strain was more rigid and recovered its deformation, while cheese made using the eps producing culture was more deformable. these results indicate that eps-producing  cultures can improve the physical properties of karish cheese by reducing undesirable rigidity.

AB  == to better understand the defense mechanism of streptococcus thermophilus against  superoxide stress, molecular analysis of 10 menadione-sensitive mutants, obtained by insertional mutagenesis, was undertaken. this analysis allowed the identification of 10 genes that, with respect to their putative functions, were classified into five categories: (i) those involved in cell wall metabolism, (ii) those involved in exopolysaccharide translocation, (iii) those involved in rna modification, (iv) those involved in iron homeostasis, and (v) those whose functions are still unknown. the behavior of the 10 menadione-sensitive mutants exposed to heat shock was investigated. data from these experiments allowed us to distinguish genes whose action might be specific to oxidative stress defense (tgt, ossf, and ossg) from those whose action may be generalized to other stressful conditions (mred, roda, pbp2b, cpsx, and iscu). among the mutants, two  harbored an independently inserted copy of pgh9:iss1 in two loci close to each other. more precisely, these two loci are homologous to the sufd and iscu genes,  which are involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. this region, called the suf region, was further characterized in s. thermophilus cnrz368 by sequencing and by construction of deltasufd and iscu(97) nonpolar mutants. the streptonigrin sensitivity levels of both mutants suggest that these two genes are involved in iron metabolism.

TI  == sugar utilisation and conservation of the gal-lac gene cluster in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the adaptation to utilise lactose as primary carbon and energy source is a characteristic for streptococcus thermophilus. these organisms, however only utilise the glucose moiety of lactose while the galactose moiety is excreted into the growth medium. in this study we evaluated the diversity of sugar utilisation  and the conservation of the gal-lac gene cluster in a collection of 18 s. thermophilus strains isolated from a variety of sources. for this purpose analysis was performed on dna from these isolates and the results were compared with those obtained with a strain from which the complete genome sequence has been determined. the sequence, organisation and flanking regions of the s. thermophilus gal-lac gene cluster were found to be highly conserved among all strains. the vast majority of the s. thermophilus strains were able to utilize only glucose, lactose, and sucrose as carbon sources, some strains could also utilize fructose and two of these were able to grow on galactose. molecular characterisation of these naturally occurring gal+ strains revealed up-mutations  in the galkte promoter that were absent in all other strains. these data support  the hypothesis that the loss of the ability to ferment galactose can be attributed to the low activity of the galkte promoter, probably as a consequence  of the adaptation to milk in which the lactose levels are in excess.

AB  == to study the role of the hinge region in nisin and to obtain mutants that exhibit altered or new biological activities and functional properties, we changed certain amino acids in the hinge region by performing site-directed mutagenesis with the nisinz structural gene ( nisz). the results showed that the nisinz mutants had decreased antimicrobial activities against micrococcus flavus ncib8166 and streptococcus thermophilus. interestingly, compared with wild nisinz, mutant n20k nisinz and m21k nisinz displayed antimicrobial activity against gram-negative shigella, pseudomonas and salmonella; and they had a higher solubility than wild-type nisinz. at ph 8, the solubilities of n20k nisinz and m21k nisinz were, respectively, three-fold higher and five-fold higher than that  of nisinz. mutant n20q nisinz and m21g nisinz were considerably more stable than  nisinz at higher temperatures and neutral or alkaline ph. these mutants provided  information that the central hinge region in nisinz plays an important role in providing the conformational flexibility required for the antimicrobial activity  on the membrane. our finding documented that it may well be worth considering the construction of the new nisin mutants with changed inhibitory activity against a  wide range of gram-negative bacteria and the improvement of functional properties by site-directed mutagenesis.

TI  == antisense rna targeting of primase interferes with bacteriophage replication in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the putative primase gene and other genes associated with the sfi21-prototype genome replication module are highly conserved in streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages. expression of antisense rnas complementary to the putative primase gene (pri3.1) from s. thermophilus phage kappa 3 provided significant protection from kappa 3 and two other sfi21-type phages. expression of pri3.10-as, an antisense rna that covered the entire primase gene, reduced the efficiency of plaquing (eop) of kappa 3 to 3 x 10(-3) and reduced its burst size  by 20%. mutant phages capable of overcoming antisense inhibition were not recovered. thirteen primase-specific antisense cassettes of different lengths (478 to 1,512 bp) were systematically designed to target various regions of the gene. each cassette conferred some effect, reducing the eop to between 0.8 and 3  x 10(-3). the largest antisense rnas (1.5 kb) were generally found to confer the  greatest reductions in eop, but shorter (0.5 kb) antisense rnas were also effective, especially when directed to the 5' region of the gene. the impacts of  primase-targeted antisense rnas on phage development were examined. the expression of pri3.10-as resulted in reductions in target rna abundance and the number of phage genomes synthesized. targeting a key genome replication function  with antisense rna provided effective phage protection in s. thermophilus.

TI  == synthesis of carotenoids by rhodotorula rubra ged8 co-cultured with yogurt starter cultures in whey ultrafiltrate.
AB  == two cultures, a yeast ( rhodorula rubra ged8) and a yogurt starter ( lactobacillus bulgaricus 2-11+ streptococcus thermophilus 15ha), were selected for associated growth in whey ultrafiltrate (wu) and active synthesis of carotenoids. in associated cultivation with the yogurt culture l bulgaricus 2-11+s. thermophilus 15ha under intensive aeration (1.3 l(-1)min(-1) air-flow rate) in wu (45 g lactose l(-1)), initial ph 5.5, 30 degrees c, the lactose-negative strain r. rubra ged8 synthesized large amounts of carotenoids (13.09 mg l(-1 )culture fluid). the carotenoid yield was approximately two-fold higher in association with a mixed yogurt culture than in association with pure yogurt bacteria. the major carotenoid pigments comprising the total carotenoids were beta-carotene (50%), torulene (12.3%) and torularhodin (35.2%). carotenoids  with a high beta-carotene content were produced by the microbial association 36 h earlier than by rhodotorula yeast species. no significant differences were notd in the ratio between the pigments synthesized by r. rubra ged8+ l. bulgaricus 2-11, r. rubra ged8+ s. thermophilus 15ha, and r.rubra ged8+yogurt culture, despite the fact that the total carotenoid concentrations were lower in the mixed cultures with pure yogurt bacteria.

TI  == changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  == whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. during this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. this study surveyed industry samples of cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees c) and abuse (37.8 degrees c) temperatures. samples stored at 4 degrees c did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees c. whey samples  derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. starter cultures evaluated included streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. whey derived from l. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees c as compared with the other cultures. galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from l. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees c in comparison with the other cultures. results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees c) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees c varies depending on the culture(s)  used in cheese production.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial communities belonging to natural whey starters for grana  padano cheese by length heterogeneity-pcr.
AB  == aims: to detect bacteria present in controlled dairy ecosystems with defined composition by length-heterogeneity (lh)-pcr. lh-pcr allows to distinguish different organisms on the basis of natural variations in the length of 16s rrna  gene sequences. methods and results: lh-pcr was applied to depict population structure of the lactic acid bacteria (lab) species recoverable from grana padano cheese whey starters. typical bacterial species present in the lab community were evidenced and well discriminated. small differences in species composition, e.g.  the frequent finding of streptococcus thermophilus and the constant presence of thermophilic lactobacilli (lactobacillus helveticus, lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis/bulgaricus and lact. fermentum) were reliably highlighted. specificity of  lh-pcr was confirmed by species-specific pcr from total dna of the cultures. conclusions: lh-pcr is a useful tool to monitor microbial composition and population dynamics in dairy starter cultures. when present, non-dominant bacterial species present in the whey starters, such as strep. thermophilus, can  easily be visualized and characterized without isolating and cultivating single strains. a similar approach can be applied to more complex dairy ecosystems such  as milk or cheese curd. significance and impact of the study: community members and differences in population structure of controlled dairy ecosystems such as whey starters for hard cheeses can be evaluated and compared in a relative easy,  fast, reliable and highly reproducible way.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == biodiversity of exopolysaccharides produced by streptococcus thermophilus strains is reflected in their production and their molecular and functional characteristics.
AB  == twenty-six lactic acid bacterium strains isolated from european dairy products were identified as streptococcus thermophilus and characterized by bacterial growth and exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing capacity in milk and enriched milk medium. in addition, the acidification rates of the different strains were compared with their milk clotting behaviors. the majority of the strains grew better when yeast extract and peptone were added to the milk medium, although the presence of interfering glucomannans was shown, making this medium unsuitable for eps screening. eps production was found to be strain dependent, with the majority of the strains producing between 20 and 100 mg of polymer dry mass per liter of fermented milk medium. furthermore, no straightforward relationship between the apparent viscosity and eps production could be detected in fermented milk medium. an analysis of the molecular masses of the isolated eps by gel permeation chromatography revealed a large variety, ranging from 10 to >2,000 kda. a distinction could be made between high-molecular-mass eps (>1,000 kda) and low-molecular-mass eps (<1,000 kda). based on the molecular size of the eps, three groups of eps-producing strains were distinguished. monomer analysis of the eps by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with amperometric detection was demonstrated to be a fast and simple method. all of the eps from the s. thermophilus strains tested were classified into six groups according to their monomer compositions. apart from galactose and glucose, other monomers, such as (n-acetyl)galactosamine, (n-acetyl)glucosamine, and rhamnose, were also found as  repeating unit constituents. three strains were found to produce eps containing (n-acetyl)glucosamine, which to our knowledge was never found before in an eps from s. thermophilus. furthermore, within each group, differences in monomer ratios were observed, indicating possible novel eps structures. finally, large differences between the consistencies of eps solutions from five different strains were assigned to differences in their molecular masses and structures.

TI  == long-term consumption of infant formulas containing live probiotic bacteria: tolerance and safety.
AB  == background: nonpathogenic live bacteria are consumed as food by many children, particularly in the form of yogurt. the tolerance and safety of long-term consumption of specific types and strains of probiotic bacteria are not well documented. objective: the goal was to evaluate tolerance to formulas containing  2 levels of probiotic supplementation and effects on growth, general clinical status, and intestinal health in free-living healthy infants. design: this was a  prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of healthy infants aged 3-24 mo. infants were assigned to receive a standard milk-based formula containing 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/g each of bifidobacterium lactis and streptococcus thermophilus, formula containing 1 x 10(6) cfu/g each of b. lactis and s. thermophilus, or unsupplemented formula. clinical outcomes included formula intake, gastrointestinal tolerance, anthropometric measures, daycare attendance, and history of illness. results: one hundred eighteen infants aged ( +/- sd) 7.0 +/- 2.9 mo at enrollment consumed formula for 210 +/- 127 d. there were no significant differences in age, sex, formula consumption, or length of study between groups. the supplemented formulas were well accepted and were associated with a lower frequency of reported colic or irritability (p < 0.001) and a lower frequency of antibiotic use (p < 0.001) than was the unsupplemented formula. there were no significant differences between groups in growth, health care attention seeking, daycare absenteeism, or other health variables. conclusion: long-term consumption of formulas supplemented with b. lactis and s.  thermophilus was well tolerated and safe and resulted in adequate growth, reduced reporting of colic or irritability, and a lower frequency of antibiotic use.

TI  == randomised clinical trial of synbiotic therapy in elective surgical patients.
AB  == background: it is possible to manipulate the composition of the gastrointestinal  microflora by administration of pre- and probiotics. this may help to preserve gut barrier function and reduce the incidence of septic morbidity. aims: to assess the effects of a combination of pre- and probiotics (synbiotic) on bacterial translocation, gastric colonisation, systemic inflammation, and septic  morbidity in elective surgical patients. patients: patients were enrolled two weeks prior to elective abdominal surgery. seventy two patients were randomised to the synbiotic group and 65 to the placebo group. patients were well matched regarding age and sex distribution, diagnoses, and possum scores. methods: patients in the synbiotic group received a two week preoperative course of lactobacillus acidophilus la5, bifidobacterium lactis bb-12, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus bulgaricus, together with the prebiotic oligofructose. patients in the placebo group received placebo capsules and sucrose powder. at surgery, a nasogastric aspirate, mesenteric lymph node, and scrapings of the terminal ileum were harvested for microbiological analysis. serum was collected preoperatively and on postoperative days 1 and 7 for measurement of c reactive protein, interleukin 6, and antiendotoxin antibodies. septic morbidity and mortality were recorded. results: there were no significant  differences between the synbiotic and control groups in bacterial translocation (12.1% v 10.7%; p = 0.808, chi(2)), gastric colonisation (41% v 44%; p = 0.719),  systemic inflammation, or septic complications (32% v 31%; p = 0.882). conclusions: in this study, synbiotics had no measurable effect on gut barrier function in elective surgical patients. further studies investigating the place of pre- and probiotics in clinical practice are required.

TI  == characterization of a theta-replicating plasmid from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == plasmids of streptococcus thermophilus were previously classified, based on dna homology, into at least four groups (a-d). here, we report the characterization of plasmids of group b and d. the sequence analysis of psmq173b (group d) indicates that this plasmid contains 4449 bp, five open reading frames (orfs) and replicates via the rolling-circle mechanism of the pgi3 family. the plasmid psmq308 (group b) contains 8144 bp and six orfs. two orfs likely encode a primase/helicase and an integrase. northern blot experiments demonstrate that these two orfs are transcribed within the three strains containing plasmids of group b. two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis shows that psmq308 replicates via a theta mechanism. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a plasmid replicating via a theta mode in s. thermophilus. finally, a classification of 20 sequenced s. thermophilus plasmids into six groups based on  their mode of replication is proposed.

TI  == development of a new method, based on a bioreactor coupled with an l-lactate biosensor, toward the determination of a nonspecific inhibition of l-lactic acid  production during milk fermentation.
AB  == the development and characteristics of a bioreactor employing bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus) encapsulated in ca-alginate beads coupled with an l-lactate biosensor are reported. the biosensor comprises a carbon paste electrode modified with enzymes hrp (horseradish peroxidase), lod (lactate oxidase), and fch (ferrocene) as redox mediator. the measurement of l-lactate is  based on the signal produced by h(2)o(2), the product of the enzymatic oxidation  of l-lactate by lod. the detection of h(2)o(2) is performed at the electrode surface via hrp/fch at low operating potential (-100mv vs ag/agcl). optimization  studies were performed using the bioreactor in conjunction with an l-lactate electrode operating in a flow injection system to assess the ability of encapsulated bacteria to ferment carbohydrate solutions. the possibility of using the developed method to assess the fermentation capability of milk samples was evaluated. bronopol (2-bromo-2-nitro propane-1,3-diol) was chosen to simulate the effect of an inhibitory agent of milk fermentation. the obtained results indicated that the evaluation of the amount of l-lactate amount produced through  the bioreactor could be used as a measure of inhibition of lactic acid production in milk samples.

TI  == effect of the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus on stratum corneum ceramide levels and signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis patients.
AB  == a reduced amount of total ceramides could be responsible for functional abnormalities of the skin of atopic dermatitis (ad) patients. the ability of an experimental cream containing sonicated streptococcus thermophilus to increase skin ceramide levels in healthy subjects has been previously reported. the aim of the present work was to investigate the effects of the topical administration of  a s. thermophilus-containing cream on ceramide levels of stratum corneum from ad  patients. a 2-week application of the cream, containing a sonicated preparation of the lactic acid bacterium s. thermophilus, in the forearm skin of 11 patients  led to a significant and relevant increase of skin ceramide amounts, which could  have resulted from the sphingomyelin hydrolysis through the bacterial sphingomyelinase. moreover, in all patients the topical application of our experimental cream also resulted in the improvement of the signs and symptoms characteristic of ad skin (i.e. erythema, scaling, pruritus).

TI  == characterization of urease genes cluster of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == aims: the milk acidification rate of streptococcus thermophilus strains can be affected by several factors, one of which is the hydrolysis of urea by the urease complex. to evaluate the technological suitability of s. thermophilus strains deprived of urease activity in milk fermentation, the genetic cluster related to  urease enzymatic activity has been characterized in the type strain dsm 20167t. methods and results: amplification of the urease genes of s. thermophilus dsm 20167t was developed on the basis of the urease gene cluster of the phylogenetically related s. salivarius. nucleotide sequencing revealed the presence of eight open reading frames, which were most homologous to ureabc (structural genes) and urei, ureefgd (accessory genes) of s. salivarius and other ureolytic bacteria. reverse transcriptase pcr experiments were in agreement with  an operon organization for the eight genes (ureiabcefgd). a food grade mutant a16 (deltaurec3) with a 693 bp in-frame deletion in urec gene exhibited a urease negative (ure-) phenotype. unlike the wild-type strain, the acidification rate of the mutant in reconstituted skimmed milk was not affected by the presence of urea or nickel ions. a small-scale yoghurt fermentation trials were carried out using  the wild-type or the ure- mutant a16 (deltaurec3) in co-culture with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 in presence of urea. the result obtained underlines that when the ure- mutant was used as a co-starter the acidification rate was higher than that obtained using the wild-type strain. conclusions: the study provides the first genetic characterization and the technological implication of s. thermophilus dsm 20617t urease activity. significance and impact of the study: the detrimental effect of ureolytic activity on the rate of milk acidification was evaluated and superseded using a food-grade ure- recombinant strain. small-scale yoghurt production trials highlighted the positive role of a ure-s. thermophilus mutant as a co-starter in  milk fermentations. moreover, the vector pmi108 developed for the construction of the ure- strain, should be considered as a potential tool for the generation of ure- dairy s. thermophilus strains selected for other relevant technological properties but characterized by the undesirable ureolytic phenotype.

TI  == effects of ph, temperature, supplementation with whey protein concentrate, and adjunct cultures on the production of exopolysaccharides by streptococcus thermophilus 1275.
AB  == effects of ph, temperature, supplementation with whey protein concentrate (wpc),  and non-eps culture on the exopolysaccharide (eps) production by streptococcus thermophilus 1275 were studied. the organism was grown in 10% reconstituted skim  milk (rsm) in a biostat b fermenter for 24 h at various ph (4.5, 5.5 and 6.5) and temperatures (30, 37, 40, and 42 degrees c), and supplementation with wpc 392, and non-eps producing s. thermophilus 1303 and the amount of eps produced were determined. bacterial counts were enumerated and the concentrations of lactic acid, lactose, glucose, and galactose were also determined. a maximum of 406 mg/l of eps was produced in rsm at 37 degrees c after 24 h of fermentation at ph 4.08  when the ph was not controlled. a ph of 5.5 and temperature of 40 degrees c were  found to be optimal for eps production by s. thermophilus 1275, yielding 458 mg/l. the eps production increased when rsm was supplemented with wpc 392. at optimum ph and at 37 degrees c with wpc supplementation, the level of eps increased to 1029 mg/l. co-culturing s. thermophilus 1275 with non-eps s. thermophilus 1303 increased eps production at 37 degrees c and ph 5.5 to 832 mg/l. high temperature (42 degrees c) reduced the amount of eps production, and eps production ceased at ph 4.5 when maintained constantly at this ph. the level  of lactose utilization and lactic acid production depended on growth conditions of the organism. no glucose was detected, while galactose was found to accumulate in the medium.

TI  == identification and characterization of the nickel uptake system for urease biogenesis in streptococcus salivarius 57.i.
AB  == ureases are multisubunit enzymes requiring ni(2+) for activity. the low ph-inducible urease gene cluster in streptococcus salivarius 57.i is organized as an operon, beginning with urei, followed by ureabc (structural genes), and ureefgd (accessory genes). urease biogenesis also requires a high-affinity ni(2+) uptake system. by searching the partial genome sequence of a closely related organism, streptococcus thermophilus lmg18311, three open reading frame (orfs) homologous to those encoding proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis and cobalt transport (cbimqo) were identified immediately 3' to the ure operon. to determine whether these genes were involved in urease biogenesis by catalyzing ni(2+) uptake in s. salivarius, regions 3' to ured were amplified by pcrs from s. salivarius by using primers identical to the s. thermophilus sequences. sequence  analysis of the products revealed three orfs. reverse transcriptase pcr was used  to demonstrate that the orfs are transcribed as part of the ure operon. insertional inactivation of orf1 with a polar kanamycin marker completely abolished urease activity and the ability to accumulate (63)ni(2+) during growth. supplementation of the growth medium with nicl(2) at concentrations as low as 2.5 micro m partially restored urease activity in the mutant. both wild-type and mutant strains showed enhanced urease activity when exogenous ni(2+) was provided at neutral ph. enhancement of urease activity by adding nickel was regulated at the posttranslational level. thus, orf1, orf2, and orf3 are part of the ure operon, and these genes, designated urem, ureq, and ureo, respectively, likely encode a ni(2+)-specific atp-binding cassette transporter.

TI  == phosphorylation of streptococcus salivarius lactose permease (lacs) by hpr(his ~  p) and hpr(ser-p)(his ~ p) and effects on growth.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus salivarius takes up lactose via a transporter called lacs that shares 95% identity with the lacs from streptococcus thermophilus, a phylogenetically closely related organism. s. thermophilus releases galactose into the medium during growth on lactose. expulsion of galactose is mediated via lacs and stimulated by phosphorylation of the transporter by hpr(his approximately p), a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (pts). unlike s. thermophilus, s. salivarius grew on lactose without expelling galactose and took  up galactose and lactose concomitantly when it is grown in a medium containing both sugars. analysis of the c-terminal end of s. salivarius lacs revealed a iia-like domain (iia(lacs)) almost identical to the iia domain of s. thermophilus lacs. experiments performed with purified proteins showed that s. salivarius iia(lacs) was reversibly phosphorylated on a histidine residue at position 552 not only by hpr(his approximately p) but also by hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p), a doubly phosphorylated form of hpr present in large amounts in rapidly growing s. salivarius cells. two other major s. salivarius pts proteins, iiab(l)(man) and iiab(h)(man), were unable to phosphorylate iia(lacs). the effect of lacs phosphorylation on growth was studied with strain g71, an s. salivarius enzyme i-negative mutant that cannot synthesize hpr(his approximately p) or hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p). these results indicated that (i) the wild-type and mutant strains had identical generation times on lactose, (ii) neither strain expelled galactose during growth on lactose, (iii) both strains metabolized lactose and galactose concomitantly when grown in a medium containing both sugars, and (iv) the growth of the mutant was slightly reduced on galactose.

TI  == influence of heat impact in reconstituted skim milk on the properties of yoghurt  fermented by ropy or non-ropy starter cultures.
AB  == the paper describes studies on the influence of heat impact in reconstituted skim milk on chemical and functional properties of yoghurt products. reconstituted skim milk was heated for 20 min at 85 degrees c, 90 degrees c, or 95 degrees c. ropy (producing exopolysaccharides, eps) or non-ropy strains of s. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were used as starter culture for yoghurt manufacture. the studies have shown that the fermentation times decreased with increasing heat impact when the ropy starter culture was used, while they remained to a far extent unchanged if the non-ropy starter culture was applied. the lactic acid contents of the yoghurt products were in the same range when the  milk was heated at 85 degrees c or 90 degrees c, while they were different when milk was heated at 95 degrees c. there was a tendency visible that an increase in preheating leads to increased l(+)- and decreased d(-)-lactic acid contents if the non-ropy culture was applied. using the ropy culture, it was vice versa. a slightly decrease in proteolysis with increasing heat impact was to be noted with both starter cultures. concerning the relation of proteolysis to acidification, the fermentation process could be subdivided into three sections with different slopes if the non-ropy starter culture was used, while a linear relation was found if the ropy starter culture was applied. regarding final product characteristics it was found that the functional properties of yoghurt decreased  with increasing heat impact when the ropy starter culture was applied, while they remained to a far extent unchanged when the non-ropy starter culture was used. it can be concluded from these studies that a preheating of milk at a temperature of 85 degrees c (20 min) is optimal in regard to final yoghurt product characteristics.

TI  == streptococcus thermophilus 580 produces a bacteriocin potentially suitable for inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum in hard cheese.
AB  == a strain of streptococcus thermophilus that inhibits clostridium tyrobutyricum has been isolated from raw milk. the active compound produced disappears after a  treatment with protease. however, unlike most bacteriocins, it is not thermoresistant, and the activity is completely lost after 1 h at 60 degrees c. its inhibitory spectrum is limited to other thermophilic streptococci, brochothrix, and sporulated gram-positive rods. so this bacteriocin could be different from those already described. this bacteriocin-producing strain could be used in thermophilic starter for hard cheese making because the bacteriocin is not active against thermophilic lactobacilli. it is produced in m17 medium during the decreasing temperature phase of the hard cheese-making process temperature cycle and is also produced in milk. moreover, when streptococcus thermophilus was cocultured with a lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis starter strain, it seems to enhance the bacteriocin production. however the level of activity always decreases drastically during the stationary phase. but inhibition of clostridium  tyrobutyricum spores can be obtained in small-scale curds.

TI  == biology of the temperate streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage tp-j34 and physical characterization of the phage genome.
AB  == the temperate streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage tp-j34 was identified in the lysogenic host strain j34. the majority of phage particles produced upon induction was defective and noninfectious, consisting of dna-filled heads lacking tails. a physical map (45.6 kb) was established. analysis of minor restriction bands of the dna isolated from phage particles as well as the analysis of the protein pattern indicated that phage tp-j34 is a pac-type phage. this was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy using antisera raised against virulent cos- and pac-type s. thermophilus phages. the lysogenic host j34 but not its noninducible derivate j34-12 contained phage dna in the nonintegrated state and exhibited autolysis at elevated temperatures. prophage-carrying strains grew homogeneously while 16 of 20 prophage-cured derivatives aggregated and sedimented rapidly. when phage tp-j34 was propagated lytically on a prophage-cured host strain, a 2.7-kb site-specific deletion occurred in the phage genome. this deletion was also identified in the prophage dnas of relysogenized strains.

TI  == a potential food-grade cloning vector for streptococcus thermophilus that uses cadmium resistance as the selectable marker.
AB  == a potential food-grade cloning vector, pnd919, was constructed and transformed into s. thermophilus st3-1, a plasmid-free strain. the vector contains dnas from  two different food-approved organisms, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the 5.0-kb pnd919 is a derivative of the cloning vector pnd918 (9.3 kb) and was constructed by deletion of the 4.3-kb region of pnd918 which contained dna from non-food-approved organisms. pnd919 carries a heterologous native cadmium resistance selectable marker from l. lactis m71 and expresses the cd(r) phenotype in s. thermophilus transformants. with the s. thermophilus replicon derived from the shuttle vector pnd913, pnd919 is able to replicate in the two s. thermophilus industrial strains tested, st3-1 and st4-1. its relatively high retention rate in s. thermophilus further indicates its usefulness as a potential food-grade cloning vector. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a replicative potential food-grade vector for the industrially important organism s. thermophilus.

TI  == selection of bacteriophage-resistant mutants of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == phage-resistant mutants have been isolated from streptococcus thermophilus. selection was carried out using anti-phage antibodies or hoechst 33258-labelled phages. two mutants out of eight tested displayed reduced acidifying capacity. selection of the bacteria that extruded more rapidly the fluorochrome 5-6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cfda) restored the acidifying capacity of these two mutants to the level of the parental strains. mutants displaying phage resistance and good acidifying capacity were obtained in 4-5 days. new phages that are able to overcome the protection mechanisms of the existing bacteria arise continually in the dairy environment. the procedures described here permit  to replace promptly the starter culture susceptible to newly emerged phages with  a resistant one.

TI  == identification of the dimer interface of the lactose transport protein from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the lactose transporter from streptococcus thermophilus catalyses the symport of  galactosides and protons. the carrier domain of the protein harbours the contact  sites for dimerization, and the individual subunits in the dimer interact functionally during the transport reaction. as a first step towards the elucidation of the mechanism behind the cooperation between the subunits, regions involved in the dimer interface were determined by oxidative and chemical cross-linking of 12 cysteine substitution mutants. four positions in the protein  were found to be susceptible to intermolecular cross-linking. to ensure that the  observed cross-links were not the result of randomly colliding particles, the cross-linking was studied in samples in which either the concentration of lacs in the membrane was varied or the oligomeric state was manipulated. these experiments showed that the cross-links were formed specifically within the dimer. the four regions of the protein located at the dimer interface are close to the extracellular ends of transmembrane segments v and viii and the intracellular ends of transmembrane segments vi and vii.

TI  == prevention of heterocyclic amine-induced dna damage in colon and liver of rats by different lactobacillus strains.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of four different lactobacillus (lb) strains, namely lactobacillus bulgaricus 291, streptococcus thermophilus f4, s.thermophilus v3 and bifidobacterium longum bb536, which are used for the production of yogurt, on the dna-damaging effects of heterocyclic aromatic amines (hcas). male f344 rats were treated orally with hca mixtures containing 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethyl-3h-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino-9h-pyrido[2,3-b]indole and 2-amino-3-methyl-3h- imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline,  which were representative of the hca contents found in fried beef ('beef mix') and chicken ('chicken mix'). suspensions of lb were given by gavage to the animals simultaneously with and at different time periods before administration of the hcas. subsequently, the extent of dna migration was measured in colon and  liver cells in single cell gel electrophoresis (scge) assays. all four strains caused complete inhibition of dna damage induced with beef mix after administration of 1 x 1010 lb cells/animal, whereas with chicken mix only marginal (non-significant) effects were seen. the inhibition of beef-induced dna  damage was dose dependent and was still significant when 1 x 107 cells/animal were administered. kinetics studies showed that the protective effects were still significant when lb was given 12 h before the beef mix. a comparison of the present results with chemical analytical data from in vitro experiments suggests  that the strong reduction in dna migration seen in the animals can be only partly explained by direct binding effects. the results of the present study show that lb are highly protective against the genotoxic effects of hcas under conditions which are relevant for humans and provide a possible explanation for the reduced  colon cancer rates observed in some studies in individuals with either high lb counts in their feces or with a high consumption of lb-containing foods.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose/mannose phosphotransferase system of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == in most streptococci, glucose is transported by the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):glucose/mannose phosphotransferase system (pts) via hpr and iiab(man), two  proteins involved in regulatory mechanisms. while most strains of streptococcus thermophilus do not or poorly metabolize glucose, compelling evidence suggests that s. thermophilus possesses the genes that encode the glucose/mannose general  and specific pts proteins. the purposes of this study were to determine (i) whether these pts genes are expressed, (ii) whether the pts proteins encoded by these genes are able to transfer a phosphate group from pep to glucose/mannose pts substrates, and (iii) whether these proteins catalyze sugar transport. the pts operon is made up of the genes encoding hpr (ptsh) and enzyme i (ei) (ptsi),  which are transcribed into a 0.6-kb ptsh mrna and a 2.3-kb ptshi mrna. the specific glucose/mannose pts proteins, iiab(man), iic(man), iid(man), and the mano protein, are encoded by manl, manm, mann, and mano, respectively, which make up the man operon. the man operon is transcribed into a single 3.5-kb mrna. to assess the phosphotransfer competence of these pts proteins, in vitro pep-dependent phosphorylation experiments were conducted with purified hpr, ei, and iiab(man) as well as membrane fragments containing iic(man) and iid(man). these pts components efficiently transferred a phosphate group from pep to glucose, mannose, 2-deoxyglucose, and (to a lesser extent) fructose, which are common streptococcal glucose/mannose pts substrates. whole cells were unable to catalyze the uptake of mannose and 2-deoxyglucose, demonstrating the inability of the s. thermophilus pts proteins to operate as a proficient transport system. this inability to transport mannose and 2-deoxyglucose may be due to a defective  iic domain. we propose that in s. thermophilus, the general and specific glucose/mannose pts proteins are not involved in glucose transport but might have regulatory functions associated with the phosphotransfer properties of hpr and iiab(man).

TI  == growth and morphology of thermophilic dairy starters in alginate beads.
AB  == the aim of this research was to produce concentrated biomasses of thermophilic lactic starters using immobilized cell technology (ict). fermentations were carried out in milk using ph control with cells microentrapped in alginate beads. in the ict fermentations, beads represented 17% of the weight. some assays were carried out with free cells without ph control, in order to compare the ict populations with those of classical starters. with streptococcus thermophilus, overall populations in the fermentor were similar, but maximum bead population for (8.2 x 10(9) cfu/g beads) was 13 times higher than that obtained in a traditional starter (4.9 x 10(8) cfu/ml). for both lactobacillus helveticus strains studied, immobilized-cell populations were about 3 x 10(9) cfu/g beads. production of immobilized lb. bulgaricus 210r strain was not possible, since no increases in viable counts occurred in beads. therefore, production of concentrated cell suspension in alginate beads was more effective for s. thermophilus. photomicrographs of cells in alginate beads demonstrated that, while the morphology of s. thermophilus remained unchanged during the ict fermentation, immobilized cells of lb. helveticus appeared wider. in addition, cells of lb. bulgaricus were curved and elongated. these morphological changes would also impair the growth of immobilized lactobacilli.

TI  == ph-sensing 96-well microtitre plates for the characterization of acid production  by dairy starter cultures.
AB  == a new method for characterization of acid production by dairy starter cultures is presented. microplates with integrated optical ph sensors are developed. two fluorophores, a ph-sensitive and a ph-insensitive one are immobilised at the bottom of a polystyrene 96-well microtitre plate. the ph-insensitive fluorophore  serves as an internal reference and makes calibration unnecessary. the sensor measures ph accurately in optically well-defined media. particles and fluorophores contained in the bulk medium disturbed the measurements. despite these disturbances it was possible to clearly sense differences in inoculum type  and in inoculum sizes of cultures of lactococcus lactis and of streptococcus thermophilus at 30 and 37 degrees c. besides a ph-related signal there is information about other changes during milk fermentation. the cultivation results were compared with those from the established cinac-method. from this comparison  it can be concluded that the new method can be used reliably to characterize particularly a large number of strains for screening purposes but also for quality control.

TI  == the role of nutrition in diarrhoea syndromes.
AB  == purpose of review: diarrhoea is a common and worldwide problem, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality, especially in children. this paper reviews recent advances in the field of nutritional intervention for the prevention and treatment of diarrhoeal diseases. recent findings: in the developing countries, the incidence of diarrhoeal diseases remains unchanged, whereas in industrialized areas a decrease has been reported. in acute diarrhoea, oral rehydration therapy  is the treatment of first choice. newer oral rehydration solutions with amylase-resistant starch or partially hydrolysed guar gum have been tested and found to be useful. promising new data on supplementation with zinc in acute diarrhoea were published last year. the use of prebiotics and probiotics in the prevention and the treatment of diarrhoea is still controversial. however, new data and meta-analyses with probiotics are available, showing benefits in the treatment of acute diarrhoea as a co-treatment with oral rehydration. the same benefits were found to apply to antibiotic-associated diarrhoea syndromes. the co-administration of probiotics to patients receiving antibiotics seems to be a promising approach for reducing the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. new evidence suggests that fibre reduces diarrhoea associated with enteral tube feeding. furthermore, a new probiotic mixture (vsl-3, viable lyophilized bacteria of 4 strains of lactobacillus, 3 strains of bifidobacterium and 1 strain of streptococcus thermophilus (vsl pharmaceuticals, inc,. ft. lauderdale, fl. usa))  was of benefit in the treatment of bacterial overgrowth and in the prevention of  diarrhoea after pelvic radiation treatment. summary: oral rehydration is still the first line of treatment for acute diarrhoea. zinc supplements have been shown to have a beneficial effect on acute diarrhoea in children. probiotics and fibre  have proved to be useful in the prevention and treatment of several diarrhoea syndromes. because of the small numbers of patients and shortcomings in design and analysis, additional large placebo-controlled trials of the effects of fibre  and probiotics, or a combination of both, in diarrhoea syndromes are needed.

TI  == effects of milk products fermented by bifidobacterium longum on blood lipids in rats and healthy adult male volunteers.
AB  == the effects of milk products fermented by bifidobacterium longum strain bl1, a probiotic strain, on blood lipids in rats and humans were studied. rats were fed  a cholesterol-enriched experimental diet, supplemented with lyophilized powders of 1) acid milk (control), 2) milk fermented with a mixed culture of ordinary yogurt starters composed of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (sl), and 3) bifidobacterium milk fermented with the probiotic b. longum strain bl1, respectively. the bifidobacterium milk feeding brought about significant lowering of the serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, in comparison with the control, while no change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was observed. on the other hand, supplementation with sl milk resulted in only slight, nonsignificant decreases in serum lipid concentrations in comparison with the control. in the human study, 32 subjects with serum total cholesterol ranging from 220 to 280 mg/dl were randomly assigned to two treatments: 1) intake of a low-fat drinking yogurt prepared with ordinary  yogurt starters composed of s. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus  (p-group) and 2) intake of a low-fat drinking yogurt prepared with the two ordinary yogurt starters plus b. longum strain bl1 (b-group). after intake for 4  wk at 3 x 100 ml/day, reduction of serum total cholesterol was observed in approximately half of the b-group subjects; a particularly significant decrease in serum total cholesterol was found among subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia (serum total cholesterol > 240 mg/dl). however, the serum lipid concentrations in the p-group subjects were almost stable during the experimental periods. the present results indicate the potential of the probiotic b. longum strain bl1 in serum lipid improvement.

AB  == nineteen bacteriological media were evaluated to assess their suitability to selectively enumerate lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and propionibacteria. bacteriological media evaluated included streptococcus thermophilus agar, ph modified mrs agar, mrs-vancomycine agar, mrs-bile agar, mrs-nacl agar, mrs-lithium chloride agar, mrs-nnlp (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride and paramomycine sulfate) agar, reinforced clostridial agar, sugar-based (such as maltose, galactose, sorbitol, manitol, esculin) media, sodium lactate agar, arabinose agar, raffinose agar, xylose agar, and l. casei agar. incubations were carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 27, 30, 37, 43, and 45 degrees c for 24, 72 h, and 7 to 9 d. s. thermophilus agar and aerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 h were suitable for s. thermophilus. l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus could be enumerated using mrs agar (ph 4.58 or ph 5.20) and under anaerobic incubation at 45 degrees c for 72 h. mrs-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 43 degrees c for 72 h were suitable to enumerate l. rhamnosus. mrs-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 72 h were selective for l. casei. to estimate the counts of l. casei by subtraction method, counts of l. rhamnosus on mrs-vancomycine agar at 43 degrees c for 72 h under anaerobic incubation could be subtracted from total counts of l. casei and l. rhamnosus enumerated on mrs-vancomycine agar at 37 degrees c for 72 h under anaerobic incubation. l. acidophilus could be enumerated using mrs-agar at 43 degrees c for 72 h or basal agar-maltose agar at 43 degrees c for 72 h or ba-sorbitol agar at 37 degrees c for 72 h, under anaerobic incubation. bifidobacteria could be enumerated on mrs-nnlp agar under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 72 h. propionibacteria could be enumerated on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees c for 7 to 9 d. a subtraction method was most suitable for counting propionibacteria in the presence of other lactic acid bacteria from a product. for this method, counts of lactic bacteria at d 3 on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees c were subtracted from counts at d 7 of lactic bacteria and propionibacteria.

TI  == effects of cultivation conditions on folate production by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a variety of lactic acid bacteria were screened for their ability to produce folate intracellularly and/or extracellularly. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus  thermophilus, and leuconostoc spp. all produced folate, while most lactobacillus  spp., with the exception of lactobacillus plantarum, were not able to produce folate. folate production was further investigated in l. lactis as a model organism for metabolic engineering and in s. thermophilus for direct translation  to (dairy) applications. for both these two lactic acid bacteria, an inverse relationship was observed between growth rate and folate production. when cultures were grown at inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics or salt or when the bacteria were subjected to low growth rates in chemostat cultures, folate levels in the cultures were increased relative to cell mass and (lactic) acid production. s. thermophilus excreted more folate than l. lactis, presumably as a  result of differences in the number of glutamyl residues of the folate produced.  in s. thermophilus 5,10-methenyl and 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate were detected as the major folate derivatives, both containing three glutamyl residues, while in l. lactis 5,10-methenyl and 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate were found, both with either four, five, or six glutamyl residues. excretion of folate was stimulated at lower ph in s. thermophilus, but ph had no effect on folate excretion by l. lactis. finally, several environmental parameters that influence folate production in these lactic acid bacteria were observed; high external ph increased folate production and the addition of p-aminobenzoic acid stimulated folate production, while high tyrosine concentrations led to decreased folate biosynthesis.

TI  == application of the shsp gene, encoding a small heat shock protein, as a food-grade selection marker for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == plasmid pst04 of streptococcus thermophilus contains a gene encoding a protein with homology to small heat shock proteins (a. geis, h. a. m. el demerdash, and k. j. heller, plasmid 50:53-69, 2003). strains cured from the shsp plasmids showed significantly reduced heat and acid resistance and a lower maximal growth  temperature. transformation of the cloned shsp gene into s. thermophilus st11 lacking a plasmid encoding shsp resulted in increased resistance to incubation at 60 degrees c or ph 3.5 and in the ability to grow at 52 degrees c. a food-grade cloning system for s. thermophilus, based on the plasmid-encoded shsp gene as a selection marker, was developed. this approach allowed selection after transfer of native and recombinant shsp plasmids into different s. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis strains. using a recombinant plasmid carrying an erythromycin  resistance (em(r)) gene in addition to shsp, we demonstrated that both markers are equally efficient in selecting for plasmid-bearing cells. the average transformation rates in s. thermophilus (when we were selecting for heat resistance) were determined to be 2.4 x 10(4) and 1.0 x 10(4) cfu/0.5 micro g of  dna, with standard deviations of 0.54 x 10(4) and 0.32 x 10(4), for shsp and em(r) selection, respectively. when we selected for ph resistance, the average transformation rates were determined to be 2.25 x 10(4) and 3.8 x 10(3) cfu/0.5 micro g of dna, with standard deviations of 0.63 x 10(4) and 3.48 x 10(3), for shsp and em(r) selection, respectively. the applicability of shsp as a selection  marker was further demonstrated by constructing s. thermophilus plasmid phrm1 carrying the shsp gene as a selection marker and the restriction-modification genes of another s. thermophilus plasmid as a functional trait.

TI  == proteolytic degradation of ewe milk proteins during fermentation of yoghurts and  storage.
AB  == yoghurts are mostly produced from cow milk and to a very limited extent from ewe  milk. the evolution of caseins and whey proteins in ovine milk submitted to different thermal treatments (63 degrees c/30 min; 73 degrees c/15 min; 85 degrees c/10 min or 96 degrees c/5 min) was followed during fermentation of yoghurts and during their storage up to 14 days, using two different sets of starters. one set of starter lab was a "ropy" culture (yc-191), which is a well-defined mixed strain culture containing streptococcus thermophilus st-143 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (lb-18 and lb-ch2). the other set of starter bacteria (yc-460) was a standard yoghurt culture("non-ropy") containing mixed strain culture of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. contents of free amino groups in produced yoghurts increased gradually during the fermentation, up to a maximal value obtained after 4 h fermentation, then they did not change significantly during storage of yoghurt produced with yc-191 starter. in contrary, a large drop in the amount of  free amino groups was observed in the first 24 h of storage in the case of yoghurt made with yc-460 indicating that microorganisms continue still to grow in low temperatures. during fermentation and storage of both yoghurt types, alpha-lactalbumin was hydrolyzed to a slightly bigger extent than beta-lactoglobulin. during fermentation, beta-casein was slightly more degraded than alpha(s)-caseins; however, the opposite was observed during storage up to 14 days. generally, a more intense heat pretreatment led to a higher degradation of  whey proteins and caseins during fermentation and storage. differences in proteolytic activity between the two starters used (whey proteins more degraded by yc-191; caseins more degraded by yc-460) may lead to improvement in production and formulation of yoghurts differing in their physicochemical and rheological properties.

AB  == the antioxidative effects of lactic acid bacteria on lipid peroxidation in the colonic mucosa were investigated. among 49 strains of lactic acid bacteria, streptococcus thermophilus yit 2001 showed the highest inhibitory activity against lipid peroxidation in liposomes induced by ferrous iron. feeding a diet containing 0.4% st. thermophilus yit 2001 (2 x 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse per day) for 2 weeks caused a significant decrease of lipid peroxide (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance) in the colonic mucosa of iron-overloaded mice (0.07% fe in the diet). the mucosal lipid peroxide level did not correlate with the soluble iron concentration of the cecal contents. therefore, it is suggested that the antioxidative effect of st. thermophilus yit 2001 in the colonic mucosa was not due to the removal of ferrous iron from the reaction system of lipid peroxidation.

AB  == microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in france, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. the aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of rdo salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. this included dna extraction, pcr, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp)  analysis. bacterial and high-gc% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify v2 or v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene. sscp patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. cloning and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. bacteria belonging to the high-gc% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. the present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.

AB  == the nucleotide sequences of eight plasmids isolated from seven streptococcus thermophilus strains have been determined. plasmids pst04, per1-1, and pj34 are related and replicate via a rolling circle mechanism. plasmid pj34 encodes for a  replication initiation protein (repa) and a small polypeptide with unknown function. plasmids pst04 and per1-1 carry in addition to repa genes coding for small heat shock proteins (shsp). expression of these proteins is induced at elevated temperatures or low ph and increases the thermo- and acid resistance. plasmids per1-2 and pst22-2 show identical sequences with five putative open reading frames (orfs). the gene products of orf1 and orf4 reveal some similarities to transposon encoded proteins of bacillus subtilis and tn916. orf1  of plasmid pst106 encodes a protein similar to resolvases of different gram-positive bacteria. integrity of orf2 and 3, encoding a putative dna primase  and a replication protein, is essential for replication. orf1 to 3 of plasmid pst08, which are organized in a tricistronic operon, encode a repa protein, an adenosine-specific methyltransferase, and a type ii restriction endonuclease. another type ii restriction-modification (r/m) system is encoded on plasmid pst0  which is highly similar to those encoded on lactococcal plasmid phw393 and b. subtilis plasmid pxh13. plasmid-free derivatives of strains st0 and st08 show increased phage sensitivity, indicating that in the wild-type strains the r/m systems are functionally expressed. recombinant plasmids based on the replicons of plasmids pst04, pj34, pst106, pst08, and pst0, are able to replicate in lactococcus lactis and b. subtilis, respectively, whereas constructs carrying per1-2 only replicate in s. thermophilus.

TI  == ester synthesis in an aqueous environment by streptococcus thermophilus and other dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus thermophilus st1 and 19 other dairy lactic acid bacteria (lab) to synthesize esters was investigated in an aqueous environment. these lab were able to synthesize esters from alcohols and glycerides via a transferase reaction (alcoholysis) in which fatty acyl groups from glycerides were transferred to alcohols. s. thermophilus st1 was active on tributyrin and on di- or monoglycerides of up to c10 with ethanol as the acyl acceptor. this strain was also active on a diglyceride of c6 and monoglyceride of c8 with 2-phenyl ethanol as the acyl acceptor. alcoholysis occurred preferentially over hydrolysis. s. thermophilus st1 had an apparent k(m) value of 250 mm for ethanol  and an apparent k(m) value of 1.3 mm for tributyrin, measured against whole cells. around 80% of both the transferase activity and the esterase activity were detected in the cell-free extract (cfe) of strain st1. both activities in the cfes of five lab tested were, to a similar degree, enhanced slightly by growth in the presence of ethanol and tributyrin. using tributyrin and ethanol as substrates, the transferase activities ranged over 0.006-1.37 units/mg cell dry weight among the lab tested and were both species- and strain-dependent.

TI  == the effect of temperature and ph on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a ph-auxostat study.
AB  == the growth of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a ph-auxostat. the computer-controlled smooth change of ph or temperature was used to study the effect of ph and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield y(atp) and specific lactate production rate q(atp)). the behaviour of mu and q(atp) with an increase of temperature suggested that atp production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the decrease of y(atp) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while q(atp) remained constant or even increased. with the decrease of ph, decrease of both y(atp) and q(atp) was observed. s. thermophilus st20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees c was the most acid sensitive strain. the l. paracasei e1h3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to ph change. the behaviour of mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus in milk in a ph-auxostat with ph-decrease was in agreement with the  pure culture experiments of the same species. the study showed that ph-auxostat with smooth controlled change of ph and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of lab.

TI  == immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, cpg-like motif exists in lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus niai b6.
AB  == the present study was conducted to find an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide derived from yogurt starter cultures. the chromosomal dna was purified from nine  strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and six strains of streptococcus thermophilus. an immunostimulatory ability of the dna was examined  in a proliferation of peyer's patch and splenic b cells. only the dna from l. bulgaricus niai b6 induced a significant proliferation of both cells. when the dna was cloned and amplified using pcr, the mitogenic activities to b cells were  significantly increased by 13 of 135 dna clones. ten homologous nucleotide sequences were found as possible oligonucleotide sequences of mitogens, and were  then chemically synthesized (sol-lb1 to sol-lb10). one cpg-like motif (sol-lb7; 5'-cggcacgctcacgattcttg-3') was identified as an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, but it did not contain palindromic cpg structure known as a b cell-specific mitogen. the sol-lb7 substantially bound to b cells and increased the cd69 positive cells in peyer's patch cells. this study demonstrated that l. bulgaricus niai b6 was a good candidate of a starter culture for the production of new functional foods, "bio-defense foods".

TI  == live probiotics protect intestinal epithelial cells from the effects of infection with enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec).
AB  == background: the colonic epithelium maintains a life long reciprocally beneficial  interaction with the colonic microbiota. disruption is associated with mucosal injury. aims: we hypothesised that probiotics may limit epithelial damage induced by enteroinvasive pathogens, and promote restitution. methods: human intestinal epithelial cell lines (ht29/cl.19a and caco-2) were exposed to enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec 029:nm), and/or probiotics (streptococcus thermophilus (st), atcc19258, and lactobacillus acidophilus (la), atcc4356). infected cells and controls were assessed for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretory responses, alterations in cytoskeletal and tight junctional proteins, and responses to epidermal growth factor (egf) stimulation. results: exposure of cell monolayers to live st/la, but not to heat inactivated st/la, significantly limited adhesion, invasion, and physiological dysfunction induced by eiec. antibiotic killed st/la reduced adhesion somewhat but were less effective in limiting the consequences of eiec invasion of cell monolayers. furthermore, live  st/la alone increased transepithelial resistance, contrasting markedly with the fall in resistance evoked by eiec infection, which could also be blocked by live  st/la. the effect of st/la on resistance was accompanied by maintenance (actin, zo-1) or enhancement (actinin, occludin) of cytoskeletal and tight junctional protein phosphorylation. st/la had no effect on chloride secretion by themselves  but reversed the increase in basal secretion evoked by eiec. eiec also reduced the ability of egf to activate its receptor, which was reversed by st/la. conclusions: live st/la interact with intestinal epithelial cells to protect them from the deleterious effect of eiec via mechanisms that include, but are not limited to, interference with pathogen adhesion and invasion. probiotics likely also enhance the barrier function of naive epithelial cells not exposed to any pathogen.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers for amplification of priming  glycosyltransferase genes of the exopolysaccharide locus in strains of the lactobacillus casei group.
AB  == a primer design strategy named codehop (consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer) for amplification of distantly related sequences was used to detect the priming glycosyltransferase (gt) gene in strains of the lactobacillus casei group. each hybrid primer consisted of a short 3' degenerate  core based on four highly conserved amino acids and a longer 5' consensus clamp region based on six sequences of the priming gt gene products from exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing bacteria. the hybrid primers were used to detect the priming gt gene of 44 commercial isolates and reference strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. casei, lactobacillus zeae, and streptococcus thermophilus. the priming gt gene was detected in the genome of both non-eps-producing (eps(-)) and eps-producing (eps(+)) strains of l. rhamnosus. the sequences of the cloned pcr products were similar to those of the priming gt  gene of various gram-negative and gram-positive eps(+) bacteria. specific primers designed from the l. rhamnosus rw-9595m gt gene were used to sequence the end of  the priming gt gene in selected eps(+) strains of l. rhamnosus. phylogenetic analysis revealed that lactobacillus spp. form a distinctive group apart from other lactic acid bacteria for which gt genes have been characterized to date. moreover, the sequences show a divergence existing among strains of l. rhamnosus  with respect to the terminal region of the priming gt gene. thus, the pcr approach with consensus-degenerate hybrid primers designed with codehop is a practical approach for the detection of similar genes containing conserved motifs in different bacterial genomes.

TI  == purification, characterization, and gene cloning of lysyl aminoeptidase from streptococcus thermophilus yrc001.
AB  == we purified and characterized an aminopeptidase from streptococcus thermophilus yrc001 to obtain an enzyme for the application of reducing bitter-defect in cheese manufacturing. the purified enzyme was a monomer, and its molecular mass was estimated to be 90-100 kda. it had a broad substrate specificity, and mostly  hydrolyzed lysyl and leucyl peptides. the optimal temperature and ph for the enzyme were 35 degrees c and ph 6.5, respectively. edta, o-phenanthroline, and p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibited its activity, therefore it was considered to be a metallopeptidase. the purified enzyme efficiently reduced the bitterness of a trypsin digest of reconstituted skim milk. therefore, we cloned a gene for the enzyme from yrc001. the nucleotide sequence of a 2,940-bp xbai fragment containing the gene was analyzed. the gene encoded 849 amino acids, and the calculated molecular mass for the mature enzyme (initial methionine is removed) was 96,434. the deduced amino acid sequence showed high homology with the known bacterial lysyl aminopeptidase (aminopeptidase n).

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI  == microstructure and rheology of yogurt made with cultures differing only in their  ability to produce exopolysaccharides.
AB  == yogurt was made using an exopolysaccharide-producing strain of streptococcus thermophilus and its genetic variant that only differed from the mother strain in its inability to produce exopolysaccharides. the microstructure was investigated  using confocal scanning laser microscopy, allowing observation of fully hydrated  yogurt and the distribution of exopolysaccharide within the protein network. yogurt made with the exopolysaccharide-producing culture exhibited increased consistency coefficients, but lower flow behavior index, yield stress, viscoelastic moduli and phase angle values than did yogurt made with the culture  unable to produce exopolysaccharide. the exopolysaccharides, when present, were found in pores in the gel network separate from the aggregated protein. these effects could be explained by the incompatibility of the exopolysaccharides with  the protein aggregates in the milk. stirring affected the yogurt made with exopolysaccharide differently from yogurt without exopolysaccharide, as it did not exhibit immediate syneresis, although the structural breakdown was increased. the shear-induced microstructure in a yogurt made with exopolysaccharide-producing culture was shown to consist of compartmentalized protein aggregates between channels containing exopolysaccharide, hindering syneresis as well as the buildup of structure after stirring.

TI  == regulation of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis by alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == aims: to demonstrate the presence of an active alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase in streptococcus thermophilus and to investigate its physiological function. methods and results: streptococcus thermophilus cnrz385 contains a gene encoding  an alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase. comparison of the production of alpha-acetolactate and its decarboxylation products, by the parent strain and an  alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutant, demonstrated the presence of a control of the pool of alpha-acetolactate by valine, leucine and isoleucine. this control occurs via an allosteric activation of the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase. cell-free extracts of s. thermophilus were not able to decarboxylate the isoleucine precursor alpha-acetohydroxybutyrate. conclusions: these results strongly suggest that one of the physiological functions of the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase in s. thermophilus is to regulate leucine and valine biosynthesis by diverting the flux of alpha-acetolactate towards acetoin when the branched-chain amino acids are present at a high concentration. significance and impact of the study: regulation of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis by alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase may occur in several other micro-organisms and explain some of their growth properties.

TI  == cell wall attachment of a widely distributed peptidoglycan binding domain is hindered by cell wall constituents.
AB  == the c-terminal region (ca) of the major autolysin acma of lactococcus lactis contains three highly similar repeated regions of 45 amino acid residues (lysm domains), which are separated by nonhomologous sequences. the ca domain could be  deleted without destroying the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme in vitro. this acma derivative was capable neither of binding to lactococcal cells nor of lysing these cells while separation of the producer cells was incomplete.  the ca domain and a chimeric protein consisting of ca fused to the c terminus of  msa2, a malaria parasite surface antigen, bound to lactococcal cells specifically via ca. the fusion protein also bound to many other gram-positive bacteria. by chemical treatment of purified cell walls of l. lactis and bacillus subtilis, peptidoglycan was identified as the cell wall component interacting with ca. immunofluorescence studies showed that binding is on specific locations on the surface of l. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus, b. subtilis, lactobacillus sake, and lactobacillus casei cells. based on these studies, we propose that lysm-type repeats bind to peptidoglycan and that binding is hindered by other cell wall constituents, resulting in localized binding of acma. lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. for l. lactis sk110,  it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no msa2ca binding is observed.

TI  == intestinal pathway of internalisation of lactic acid bacteria and gut mucosal immunostimulation.
AB  == the induction of the gut mucosal immune response is dependent on the antigen interacting with the m cells of peyer's patches and with the immune cells associated with this lymphoid organ. in previous studies we showed that the mucosal immunostimulation by lab varied depending upon the strain being studied.  some of them increased the inflammatory immune response and others enhanced the level of secretory antibody (s-iga). our aim was to determine the pathway of the  internalisation of lab strains in the intestine, to provide a basis for understing the different behaviour exhibited by them. the presence of lab on peyer's patches or in the immune cells associated with the villi of small intestine was determined using fluorescein-labelled bacteria and by transmission  electron microscopy. mice were dosed orally by intubation, with 10<sup>1</sup> cells of labelled single strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. for electron microscopy studies unlabelled bacteria were used. histological preparations of the small and large intestine were performed 1 hour  after administration of the bacteria. fluorescent bacteria of l. casei and s. thermophilus were found only in peyer's patches while l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus were observed in peyer's patches and in the small intestine. l. acidophilus was also found in the large intestine. we confirmed these findings by electron microscopy. we determined that for l. casei the pathway of internalisation was via the m and fae cells of peyer's patches, while  for s. thermophilus, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus the interaction with the immune cells of peyer's patches was through the follicle associated epithelium (fae). l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus also interacted with the epithelial cells of the small intestine and l. acidophilus with epithelial cells of the large intestine. these results suggest that the different effects of lab on the mucosal immunostimulation, are related to the different pathways of gut internalisation used to take contact with the immune cells associated with the lamina propria intestinal.

TI  == biochemistry, genetics, and applications of exopolysaccharide production in streptococcus thermophilus: a review.
AB  == many strains of streptococcus thermophilus synthesize extracellular polysaccharides. these molecules may be produced as capsules that are tightly associated with the cell, or they may be liberated into the medium as a loose slime (i.e., "ropy" polysaccharide). although the presence of exopolysaccharide does not confer any obvious advantage to growth or survival of s. thermophilus in milk, in situ production by this species or other dairy lactic acid bacteria typically imparts a desirable "ropy" or viscous texture to fermented milk products. recent work has also shown that exopolysaccharide-producing s. thermophilus can enhance the functional properties of mozzarella cheese, but they are not phage-proof. as our understanding of the genetics, physiology, and functionality of bacterial exopolysaccharides continues to improve, novel applications for polysaccharides and polysaccharide-producing cultures are likely to emerge inside and outside the dairy industry. this article provides an overview of biochemistry, genetics, and applications of exopolysaccharide production in s. thermophilus.

AB  == effects of the high pressure treatment in the range of 200 - 1000 mpa/15 min., at the room temperature, on survivability of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus was investigated. sensorial characteristics of yoghurt was conducted by a panel of experts. influence of yoghurt acidity on the effect of pressurization was also determined. in the experiment, we also attempted to extend shelf-life of yoghurt, subjecting it to the pressure of 550 mpa/15 min. pressure treated yoghurt was stored for 4-weeks at room and refrigerated temperature; every seven days microbial number, acidity  and sensory attributes of the beverage was determined. addition of fruit jam on the effect of pressurization was also checked. survivability of microorganisms depends on the value of pressure used in the experiment. the research displayed that yoghurt acidity did not influence the effect of pressurization. during 4-weeks of storage, yoghurt processed at 550 mpa maintained its beneficial characteristics longer compared to the non-pressurized one. addition of fruit jam beneficially affected consistency of the pressure treated yoghurt. the conducted  studies showed that there was possibility of preserving yoghurt by the method of  high pressures. thus, to preserve yoghurt, the complete inactivation of microflora is not necessary.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == proteolytic specificity of lactobacillus delbrueckli subsp. bulgaricus influences functional properties of mozzarella cheese.
AB  == low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheeses were manufactured from 2% fat milk and  aged for 21 d. treatments included cheeses made with one of three different strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in combination with a single strain of streptococcus thermophilus. a fourth, control treatment consisted of cheeses made with only s. thermophilus. although total proteolytic ability of these strains, as indicated by the o-phthaldialdehyde analysis, was similar in each of the three strains of l. bulgaricus, these strains exhibited different proteolytic specificities toward the peptide, alpha(s1)-cn (f 1-23). on the basis of their alpha(s1)-cn (f 1-23) cleavage patterns and a previously described classification, these strains were assigned to the groups i, iii, and v. the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of lactobacilli proteolytic systems, based on specificity toward alpha(s1)-cn (f 1-23), on functionality of part-skim mozzarella cheese. moisture, fat, protein, salt-in-moisture, and moisture in nonfat substances content of cheeses made with  groups i, iii, and v strain were similar. control cheese had a lower moisture content than did other treatments. significant differences were observed in functional properties between cheeses manufactured using groups iii and v strains. cheeses made with groups i and iii strains were similar in their meltability, hardness, cohesiveness, melt strength, and stretch quality. meltability and cohesiveness increased with age, while melt strength and stretch  quality decreased with age for all cheeses. additionally, hplc showed that total  peak areas of water-soluble peptides derived from cleavage of alpha(s1)-cn (f 1-23) by different strains of lactobacilli could be highly correlated to meltability and stretch characteristics of cheeses made with those strains.

AB  == several strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, which produced exocellular polysaccharides (eps), varied in the amount produced. the streptococci tended to produce the most eps per milliliter of culture; however, when compared on the basis of amounts per 10(7) cfu, the lactobacilli produced the most. lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus strains lb-18 and lb-10442 and s. thermophilus st-143 produced significantly larger amounts per 107 cfu than did other strains tested. these three cultures plus two  strains of the streptococci that produced the greatest amounts of eps per ml of culture were tested for the ability to bind bile acids from laboratory media. the two cultures of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (lb-18 and lb-10442) bound significantly higher amounts of cholic acid than did the three strains of streptococci. these two cultures of lactobacilli bound up to 15.3% of the cholic  acid present in laboratory media, up to 452 microg/mg of eps and 2.9 microg/10(7) cfu. none of the cultures tested in this study were able to bind the conjugated bile acid, glycocholic acid.

TI  == dna-binding activity of the streptococcus thermophilus phage sfi21 repressor.
AB  == the cloned streptococcus thermophilus phage sfi21 repressor open reading frame (orf) 127 gp protects a cell against superinfection with the homologous temperate, but not against virulent phages. as demonstrated by dnase protection assay and gel shift experiments, the repressor binds to a 25-bp operator site located upstream of the repressor gene. a second sequence-related operator was identified 265 bp apart at the 3'-end of orf 75, the topological equivalent of a  cro repressor gene. the replacement of a bp at the middle or at the right side of the operator decreased substantially the affinity of the repressor for the operator. in gel shift assays, the 75 gp did not bind dna from the genetic switch region. however, when increasing amounts of orf 75 gp containing cell extracts were added to orf 127 gp containing cell extracts, the repressor could no longer  bind its operator site.

TI  == identification of a phosphofructokinase-encoding gene from streptococcus thermophilus cnrz1205--a novel link between carbon metabolism and gene regulation?
AB  == in order to isolate genes encoding so-called two-component regulatory systems from the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus, a cloning strategy was employed based on suppression of the alkaline phosphatase-negative phenotype displayed by the escherichia coli strain ancc22. several suppressing clones were  obtained which were shown to produce alkaline phosphatase activity. sequence analysis of four of these clones revealed the presence of overlapping dna inserts representing two orfs, designated pfkt and pykt, whose deduced protein products exhibit significant similarity to phosphofructokinases and pyruvate kinases, respectively, from a variety of bacteria. a plasmid bearing pfkt was shown to complement a phosphofructokinase-negative mutant of e. coli, showing that this gene indeed specifies phosphofructokinase activity. it was shown that suppression of the alkaline phosphatase-negative phenotype of e. coli ancc22 due to the presence of pfkt is caused by modulation of the intracellular level of acetyl phosphate.

AB  == yoghurt from cow's milk artificially contaminated with aflatoxin m1 (afm1) at levels of 0.050 and 0.100 g l(-1) was fermented to reach phs 4.0 and 4.6. yoghurt fermented to ph 4.6 was also used for preparing strained yoghurt. yoghurts were stored at 4 degrees c for up to 4 weeks. analysis of afm1 in milk, yoghurt, strained yoghurt and yoghurt whey was carried out using immunoaffinity column extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with fluorometric detection. afm1 levels in yoghurt samples showed a significant decrease (p < 0.01) compared with  those initially added to milk. growth of culture lactic acid bacteria was not affected in the afm1 contaminated yoghurts, with the exception of streptococcus thermophilus that showed a significantly (p < 0.01) lower increase in the yoghurt containing the toxin at high concentration. following fermentation, afm1 was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in yoghurts with ph 4.0 than in yoghurts with ph 4.6 at both contamination levels. during refrigerated storage, afm1 was rather more stable in yoghurts with ph 4.6 than with ph 4.0. the percentage loss of the  initial amount of afm1 in milk was estimated at about 13 and 22% by the end of the fermentation, and 16 and 34% by the end of storage for yoghurts with phs 4.6  and 4.0, respectively. the percentage distribution ratio of afm1 in strained yoghurt/yoghurt whey of the initial toxin present in the yoghurt was about 90/10  and 87/13 for the lower and the higher contamination levels, respectively.

TI  == transcription analysis of streptococcus thermophilus phages in the lysogenic state.
AB  == the transcription of prophage genes was studied in two lysogenic streptococcus thermophilus cells by northern blot and primer-extension experiments. in the lysogen containing the cos-site phage sfi21 only two gene regions of the prophage were transcribed. within the lysogeny module an 1.6-kb-long mrna started at the promoter of the phage repressor gene and covered also the next two genes, including a superinfection exclusion (sie) gene. a second, quantitatively more prominent 1-kb-long transcript was initiated at the promoter of the sie gene. another prophage transcript of 1.6-kb length covered a group of genes without database matches that were located between the lysin gene and the right attachment site. the rest of the prophage genome was transcriptionally silent. a  very similar transcription pattern was observed for a s. thermophilus lysogen containing the pac-site phage o1205 as a prophage. prophages from pathogenic streptococci encode virulence genes downstream of the lysin gene. we speculate that temperate phages from lactic streptococci also encode nonessential phage genes ("lysogenic conversion genes") in this region that increase the ecological  fitness of the lysogen to further their own evolutionary success. a comparative genome analysis revealed that many temperate phages from low gc content gram-positive bacteria encode a variable number of genes in that region and none  was linked to known phage-related function. prophages from pathogenic streptococci encode toxin genes in this region. in accordance with theoretical predictions on prophage-host genome interactions a prophage remnant was detected  in s. thermophilus that had lost most of the prophage dna while transcribed prophage genes were spared from the deletion process.

TI  == cell-wall proteinases prts and prtb have a different role in streptococcus thermophilus/lactobacillus bulgaricus mixed cultures in milk.
AB  == the manufacture of yoghurt relies on the simultaneous utilization of two starters: streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (lb. bulgaricus). a protocooperation usually takes place between the two species, which often results in enhanced milk acidification and aroma formation compared to pure cultures. cell-wall proteinases of lactococcus lactis  and lactobacilli have been shown to be essential to growth in milk in pure cultures. in this study, the role of proteinases prts from s. thermophilus and prtb from lb. bulgaricus in bacterial growth in milk was evaluated; a negative mutant for the prts gene of s. thermophilus cnrz 385 was constructed for this purpose. pure cultures of s. thermophilus cnrz 385 and its prts-negative mutant were made in milk as well as mixed cultures of s. thermophilus and lb. bulgaricus: s. thermophilus cnrz 385 or its prts-negative mutant was associated with several strains of lb. bulgaricus, including a prtb-negative strain. the ph  and growth of bacterial populations of the resulting mixed cultures were followed, and the lactobacillus strain was found to influence both the extent of  the benefit of lb. bulgaricus/s. thermophilus association on milk acidification and the magnitude of s. thermophilus population dominance at the end of fermentation. in all mixed cultures, the sequential growth of s. thermophilus then of lb. bulgarius and finally of both bacteria was observed. although proteinase prts was essential to s. thermophilus growth in milk in pure culture,  it had no effect on bacterial growth and thus on the final ph of mixed cultures in the presence of prtb. in contrast, proteinase prtb was necessary for the growth of s. thermophilus, and its absence resulted in a higher final ph. from these results, a model of growth of both bacteria in mixed cultures in milk is proposed.

AB  == pyroglutamic acid is present in high amounts (0.5g/ 100g) in many cheese varieties-and particularly in extensively ripened italian cheeses such as grana padano and parmigiano reggiano. an in vivo model system for cooked mini-cheese production and ripening acceleration was set up to demonstrate the ability of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria, used as a starter, to produce pyroglutamic acid (pglu). in mini-cheeses stored at 38 and 30 degrees c for up to 45 d, all starters tested produced different amounts of pglu. in descending order of pglu production, the bacteria analyzed were: lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis. evidence for the presence of glutamine to pglu cyclase activity in lactic acid bacteria was provided. cell lysates obtained from cultures of l. helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and s. thermophilus showed the ability to cyclize glutamine to pglu, resulting in processing yields from 1.4 to 30.3%, depending on the subspecies. formation of pglu from free glutamine appeared to be similar to that  observed using a glutamine-glutamine dipeptide substrate. under the experimental  conditions applied, pglu aminopeptidase activity was only detected in l. helveticus. thus, pglu formation in long-ripened cooked cheese may depend on the  activity of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == metabolic engineering of acetaldehyde production by streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the process of acetaldehyde formation by the yogurt bacterium streptococcus thermophilus is described in this paper. attention was focused on one specific reaction for acetaldehyde formation catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase  (shmt), encoded by the glya gene. in s. thermophilus, shmt also possesses threonine aldolase (ta) activity, the interconversion of threonine into glycine and acetaldehyde. in this work, several wild-type s. thermophilus strains were screened for acetaldehyde production in the presence and absence of l-threonine.  supplementation of the growth medium with l-threonine led to an increase in acetaldehyde production. furthermore, acetaldehyde formation during fermentation  could be correlated to the ta activity of shmt. to study the physiological role of shmt, a glya mutant was constructed by gene disruption. inactivation of glya resulted in a severe reduction in ta activity and complete loss of acetaldehyde formation during fermentation. subsequently, an s. thermophilus strain was constructed in which the glya gene was cloned under the control of a strong promoter (p(laca)). when this strain was used for fermentation, an increase in ta activity and in acetaldehyde and folic acid production was observed. these results show that, in s. thermophilus, shmt, displaying ta activity, constitutes  the main pathway for acetaldehyde formation under our experimental conditions. these findings can be used to control and improve acetaldehyde production in fermented (dairy) products with s. thermophilus as starter culture.

TI  == molecular characterization of cadmium resistance in streptococcus thermophilus strain 4134: an example of lateral gene transfer.
AB  == two genes (cadc(st) and cada(st) [subscript st represents streptococcus thermophilus]), located on the chromosome of s. thermophilus 4134, were shown to  constitute a cadmium/zinc resistance cassette. the genes seem to be organized in  an operon, and their transcription is cadmium dependent in vivo. the proposed product of the cada open reading frame (cada(st)) is highly similar to p-type cadmium efflux atpases, whereas the predicted protein encoded by cadc(st) (cadc(st)) shows high similarity to arsr-type regulatory proteins. the observed homologies and g+c content of this cassette and surrounding regions suggest that  this dna was derived from lactococcus lactis and may have been introduced relatively recently into the s. thermophilus 4134 genome by a lateral gene transfer event. the complete cassette confers cadmium and zinc resistance to both s. thermophilus and l. lactis, but expression of cada(st) alone is sufficient to  give resistance. by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays it was shown that the cadc(st) protein is a dna binding protein that binds specifically to its own  promoter region, possibly to two copies of an inverted repeat, and that this cadc(st)-dna interaction is lost in the presence of cadmium. using lacz fusion constructs it was shown that the cadmium-dependent expression of cada(st) is mediated by the negative regulator cadc(st). a model for the regulation of the expression of cadmium resistance in s. thermophilus is discussed.

TI  == characterization of the mela locus for alpha-galactosidase in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == alpha-galactosides are abundant sugars in legumes such as soy. because of the lack of alpha-galactosidase (alpha-gal) in the digestive tract, humans are unable to digest these sugars, which consequently induce flatulence. to develop the consumption of the otherwise highly nutritional soy products, the use of exogenous alpha-gal is promising. in this framework, we characterized the mela gene for alpha-gal in lactobacillus plantarum. the mela gene encodes a cytoplasmic 84-kda protein whose enzymatically active form occurs as oligomers. the mela gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, yielding an active alpha-gal. we show that mela is transcribed from its own promoter, yielding a monocistronic mrna, and that it is regulated at the transcriptional level, i.e.,  it is induced by melibiose but is not totally repressed by glucose. posttranscriptional regulation by the carbon source could also occur. upstream of mela, a putative galactoside transporter, designated rafp, was identified that shows high homology to lacs, the unique transporter for both alpha- and beta-galactosides in streptococcus thermophilus. rafp is also expressed as a monocistronic mrna. downstream of mela, the lacl and lacm genes were identified that encode a heterodimeric beta-galactosidase. a putative galm gene identified in the same cluster suggests the presence of a galactose operon. these results indicate that the genes involved in galactoside catabolism are clustered in l. plantarum atcc 8014. this first genetic characterization of mela and of its putative associated transporter, rafp, in a lactobacillus opens doors to various  applications both in the manufacture of soy-derived products and in probiotic and nutraceutical issues.

AB  == aims: to assess intraspecific genetic heterogeneity among commercial swiss cheese starter culture strains of lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus and propionibacterium freudenreichii and to compare the efficacy of two genetic typing methods. methods and results: two genetic typing methods, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr), were used. nine strep. thermophilus strains revealed eight pfge and five ap-pcr genotypes. seventeen lactobacillus strains yielded 16 and five genotypes by pfge and ap-pcr, respectively. eleven propionibacterium strains yielded 10 pfge genotypes. cluster analysis of pfge profiles generated similarity coefficients for strep. thermophilus, lact. helveticus and prop. freudenreichii strains of 29.5%, 60.3%,  and 30.5%, respectively. milk acidification rates for strep. thermophilus and lact. helveticus were determined. conclusions: pulsed field gel electrophoresis is more discriminatory than ap-pcr. the lact. helveticus group is more homogeneous than the other species examined. strains with > 87% similarity by pfge consistently had the same acidification rate and ap-pcr profile. significance and impact of the study: bacterial strains sold for swiss cheese manufacture in the united states are genetically diverse. clustering of genetically related bacteria may be useful in identifying new strains with industrially relevant traits.

TI  == the icest1 element of streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  == the 34,734-bp element icest1 from streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. icest1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. six proteins of the putative conjugative system of icest1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon tn916 from enterococcus faecalis. a comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low g+c bacteria including bacillus subtilis, clostridium difficile, e. faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative  elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. these exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. we propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and  integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "integrative and conjugative elements" (ices), irrespective of the  integration specificity.

AB  == growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of escherichia coli o157:h7 (atcc 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (ncimb 11778) and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (ncimb 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees c for 24 h. e. coli o157:h7 (10(5) cfu/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees c (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees c (to mimic african ambient temperature) for 5 days. after 24 h of fermentation, the ph of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees c decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees c, the ph decreased to ph 5.0 +/-  0.1. during this period, viable counts for e. coli o157:h7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) cfu/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees c wherein viability declined to 10(4) cfu/ml. in fermented (25-30 degrees c) milk stored at 4 degrees c for 5 days, e. coli o157:h7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) cfu/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees c resulted in loss of detectable cells. in contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees c  for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. stationary phase e. coli o157:h7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees c) survived during 4 degrees c storage, but  not 25 degrees c storage. fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of e. coli o157:h7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.

TI  == thermophilic lactic acid bacteria phages isolated from argentinian dairy industries.
AB  == sixty-one natural phages (59 of streptococcus thermophilus and 2 of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) were isolated from argentinian dairy plants from november 1994 to july 2000. specifically, 17 yogurt samples (18% of all samples)  and 26 cheese samples (79%) contained phages lytic to s. thermophilus strains. the number of viral particles found in samples ranged from 10(2) to 10(9) pfu/ml. the phages belonged to bradley's group b or the siphoviridae family (morphotype b1). they showed high burst size values and remarkably short latent periods. the  results of this study show that phages were found more frequently in cheesemaking processes than in yogurt-making processes. the commercial streptococcus strains appeared to propagate more phages, whereas the natural strains propagated fewer phage strains. these results suggest that the naturally occurring cultures are inherently more phage resistant.

TI  == the dilemma of phage taxonomy illustrated by comparative genomics of sfi21-like siphoviridae in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the complete genome sequences of two dairy phages, streptococcus thermophilus phage 7201 and lactobacillus casei phage a2, are reported. comparative genomics reveals that both phages are members of the recently proposed sfi21-like genus of siphoviridae, a widely distributed phage type in low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. graded relatedness, the hallmark of evolving biological systems, was observed when different sfi21-like phages were compared. across the structural module, the graded relatedness was represented by a high level of dna sequence similarity or protein sequence similarity, or a shared gene map in the absence of sequence relatedness. this varying range of relatedness was found within sfi21-like phages from a single species as demonstrated by the different prophages harbored by lactococcus lactis strain il1403. a systematic dot plot analysis with 11 complete l. lactis phage genome sequences revealed a clear separation of all temperate phages from two classes of virulent phages. the temperate lactococcal phages share dna sequence homology in a patchwise fashion over the nonstructural gene cluster. with respect to structural genes, four dna homology groups could be defined within temperate l. lactis phages. closely related structural modules for all four dna homology groups were detected in phages from streptococcus or listeria, suggesting that they represent distinct evolutionary lineages that have not uniquely evolved in l. lactis. it seems reasonable to base phage taxonomy on data from comparative genomics. however, the peculiar modular nature of phage evolution creates ambiguities in the definition  of phage taxa by comparative genomics. for example, depending on the module on which the classification is based, temperate lactococcal phages can be classified as a single phage species, as four distinct phage species, or as two if not three different phage genera. we propose to base phage taxonomy on comparative genomics of a single structural gene module (head or tail genes). this partially phylogeny-based taxonomical system still mirrors some aspects of the current international committee on taxonomy in virology classification system. in this system the currently sequenced lactococcal phages would be grouped into five genera: c2-, sk1, sfi11-, r1t-, and sfi21-like phages.

TI  == effect of medium composition and temperature and ph changes on exopolysaccharide  yields and stability during streptococcus thermophilus ly03 fermentations.
AB  == to increase the exopolysaccharide (eps) yields from streptococcus thermophilus ly03 and to unravel the nature of the eps degradation process, fermentation experiments were carried out with this strain in a customized mrs medium, using different additional carbohydrates or amino acids possibly related to growth and  eps production. no significant increase of the eps yields or activities of the enzymes alpha-phosphoglucomutase, udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase and udp-galactose 4-epimerase that are correlated with eps production, or of the activity of dtdp-glucose pyrophosphorylase involved in the rhamnose synthetic branch of eps biosynthesis, was observed. the eps monomer composition remained unchanged for all experiments. fermentations with a sudden temperature increase or lowered ph were carried out as well to try to avoid eps degradation upon prolonged fermentation. it was demonstrated that eps degradation took place enzymatically.  incubations of purified high-molecular-mass eps with cell-free culture supernatant or cell extracts showed its degradation by enzymes with an endo-activity. this glycohydrolytic activity probably encompasses several enzymes having a molecular mass lower than 50,000 and 10,000 da, and seems to be rather stable at high temperature and low ph. these results contribute to a better understanding of the physiological and chemical factors influencing eps production and degradation.

TI  == physicochemical properties and bacterial resistance of biodegradable milk protein films containing agar and pectin.
AB  == free-standing sterilized edible films based on milk proteins, namely calcium caseinate and whey protein isolate, and polysaccharides, namely pectin and agar,  were developed. cross-linking of the proteins was achieved by the combination of  thermal and radiative treatments. autoclaving pectin and agar prior to their addition to the protein solutions generated films with an improved (p < or = 0.05) puncture strength. the presence of proteins and pectin-agar in the film formulation enhanced (p < or = 0.05) the moisture barrier of the films by 18%. a  strain of streptococcus thermophilus was used to assess the biodegradability behavior of the cross-linked films. microbiological counts and soluble nitrogen analysis confirmed the biodegradability property of the milk protein films containing autoclaved pectin and agar.

TI  == the evaluation of mixtures of yeast and potato extracts in growth media for biomass production of lactic cultures.
AB  == the effectiveness of yeast extracts (ye) and potato extracts (pe) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (as). two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using odmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) eleven lots from the  same pe-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. the odmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. the growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% pe than in base medium containing 100% ye for both odmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the  lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in pe. in as assays, highest od values  for lactobacillus casei eq28, lactobacillus rhamnosus r-011, lactobacillus plantarum eq12, and streptococcus thermophilus r-083 were obtained with a mixture of pe and ye. fermentations (2 l) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of as to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. in these fermentations, replacement of 50% ye with pe was shown to enable good growth of s. thermophilus. with l. rhamnosus r-011, a high correlation (r2 = 0.95) was found between odmax data obtained in the as assays and that of the 2-l bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. however, as was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. the relationship was still good for odmax between as data and that of the bioreactor data with l. rhamnosus r-011 in industrial lbs medium (r2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the s. thermophilus r-083 on rosell #43 industrial medium (r2  = 0.33). since pe cost 40% less than ye, there are strong economic advantages in  considering such a partial replacement of ye by pe.

TI  == combined in-gel tryptic digestion and cnbr cleavage for the generation of peptide maps of an integral membrane protein with maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == a limitation of the in-gel approaches for the generation of peptides of membrane  proteins is the size and hydrophobicity of the fragments generated. for membrane  proteins like the lactose transporter (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus, tryptic digestion or cnbr cleavage yields several hydrophobic fragments larger than 3.5 kda. as a result, the sequence coverage of the membrane domain is low when the in-gel tryptic-digested or cnbr-cleaved fragments are analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry (ms). the combination of tryptic digestion and subsequent cnbr cleavage on the same gel pieces containing lacs approximately doubled the coverage of the hydrophobic membrane domain compared to the individual cleavage methods, while the coverage of the soluble domain remained complete. the fragments formed are predominantly below m/z 2500, which allows accurate mass measurement.

TI  == direct observation of bacterial exopolysaccharides in dairy products using confocal scanning laser microscopy.

TI  == microbial community dynamics during the scamorza altamurana cheese natural fermentation.
AB  == the growth dynamics of the natural microbial community responsible for the fermentation of scamorza altamurana, a typical southern italian cheese made using backslopping, was investigated applying a polyphasic approach combining 1) microbial enumeration with culture media, 2) randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) fingerprinting of microbial communities, 3) sequencing of partial 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) genes, and 4) physiological tests. viable cell counts on different culture media showed that the cocci community prevailed during the 18 h of curd fermentation and the 6 d of cheese ripening. rapd fingerprinting made it  possible to isolate 25 different strains identified by 16s rdna sequencing as belonging to five species of lactobacillus, three species of streptococcus, one species of weissella, and one species of enterococcus. the physiological analyses of all lactic acid bacteria strains revealed that the isolates belonging to streptococcus genus were the most acidifying, whereas lactobacilli were most proteolytic. streptococcus thermophilus c48w and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b15z dominated all through the fermentation process. furthermore, they seemed to be stable in a subsequent whey sample analyzed after 7 mo. the recovery of strains endowed with interesting technological features, such as acidifying and proteolytic activities, and surviving in natural whey could allow the upscaling of cheese processing safeguarding the organoleptic characteristics of scamorza altamurana and could possibly improve other fermented dairy products.

TI  == transposition of pgh9:iss1 is random and efficient in streptococcus thermophilus  cnrz368.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus bacteria are used as a starter in the fermentation of  yogurts and many cheeses. to construct mutants of s. thermophilus cnrz368, the use of the plasmid pgh9:iss1 was considered. this plasmid is known to be a good tool for insertional mutagenesis in gram-positive bacteria, owing to its ability  to integrate in the genome by a mechanism of replicative transposition. however,  the presence of three endogenous iss1 copies in the genome of s. thermophilus cnrz368 and the possible occurrence of homologous recombination could reduce the  efficiency of pgh9:iss1 as a tool for generating mutants. to address this question, the ability of pgh9:iss1 to transpose randomly in the genome of strain  cnrz368 was investigated. the results of our experiments indicated that: (i) the  frequency of transposition of iss1 was high, approximately 2 x 10(-2), in s. thermophilus cnrz368; (ii) the integration of multiple tandem copies of the plasmid was frequent; (iii) homologous recombination events between iss1 were not predominant; and (iv) plasmid pgh9:iss1 transposed randomly around the s. thermophilus cnrz368 chromosome. in addition, we describe the strategy used to localize the pgh9:iss1 insertion locus on the physical map of strain cnrz368 and  the method used to clone the regions flanking this insertion site, especially when multiple copies of the plasmid were integrated in tandem.

AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

TI  == evolution of carbohydrate fraction in carbonated fermented milks as affected by beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains.
AB  == the influence of carbonation on the evolution of lactose, galactose and glucose in fermented milks with added probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus and/or bifidobacterium bifidum) was evaluated and related to beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains. during incubation and  first days of refrigeration, lactose hydrolysis resulting in the liberation of galactose and glucose occurred in ct (streptococcus thermophilus/lb. casei), at (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus) and abt fermented milks (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus/bifid. bifidum). levels of galactose were higher than those of glucose and could be related to the preferential consumption of glucose by actively growing bacteria. through the incubation, lactose and monosaccharide levels were not affected by milk carbonation. however, during refrigerated storage the presence of this gas was associated with slightly lower  content of lactose and higher levels of galactose and glucose in at and abt products but not in ct fermented milks. through the refrigeration galactose was moderately utilised by lb. acidophilus in at products whereas the presence of bifid. bifidum seems to prevent the consumption of this sugar in abt fermented milks. glucose remained constant, with minor variations in ct products but a continuous increase of this sugar occurred in carbonated at and abt fermented milks during storage. beta-galactosidase activity displayed by str. thermophilus  strains was similar at ph 6.5 (initial ph of non-carbonated samples) and ph 6.3 (initial ph of carbonated samples) whereas lb. acidophilus laa3 showed greater beta-galactosidase activity at ph 6.3 than at higher ph values. thus, the enhanced metabolic activity of lb. acidophilus caused by the low initial ph of carbonated milk also promoted higher cellular beta-galactosidase activity that could have released greater amounts of galactose and glucose from lactose in at and abt fermented milks through the refrigerated period. in ct fermented milks, similar beta-galactosidase activity levels of str. thermophilus at ph 6.5 and 6.3 together with the absence of beta-galactosidase activity in lb. casei could explain the lack of differences on glucose and galactose content between carbonated and non-carbonated samples.

AB  == for the lytic growth cycle of the temperate cos-site streptococcus thermophilus phage sfi21 a transcription map was developed on the basis of systematic northern blot hybridizations. all deduced 5' ends were confirmed by primer extension analysis. three time classes of transcripts were observed. early transcripts were identified in four different genome regions. one prominent early mrna of 4.8 kb length covered a group of 12 genes located between the origin of replication and  the cos-site. two short early mrnas represented a single gene from the direct vicinity of the cos-site and the superinfection immunity gene from the lysogeny module, respectively. a fourth early transcript covered a group of four genes located between the lysin and the integrase gene. middle transcripts of 2.1 and 5.8 kb length covered cro-like and ant-like repressor genes and the dna replication module, respectively. four types of late transcripts were identified. the transcripts covered the likely dna packaging genes, the head morphogenesis module plus the major tail gene, the remainder of the tail genes, and the putative tail fiber plus lysis genes, respectively. only the transcript from the  head morphogenesis genes yielded defined late mrna species. the transcription map concurred with most of the in silico predictions for the genome organization of phage sfi21 except for the separation of the dna replication module from a possible transcription regulation module. most 5' ends of the transcripts determined in primer-extension experiments were not preceded by a consensus promoter sequence. the involvement of phage-encoded regulators for middle and late transcription was suggested by chloramphenicol-inhibition experiments.

TI  == behavior of listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus b producing a bacteriocin active against listeria monocytogenes atcc 7644 and staphylococcus aureus sad 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. the bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that  of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (cfs). although the cfs inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the  spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. l. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. the bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a bac- lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cy strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling l. monocytogenes and s. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees c) or abuse (ca.  22 degrees c) temperature. yogurt samples were contaminated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) cfu/ml of milk, respectively. the results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against l. monocytogenes than against s. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. while l. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, s. aureus survived in bac+ and bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees c). use of a bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.

TI  == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria used for fermented  dairy products.
AB  == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. for this aim, a total of 48 strains of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. the detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized  by growth kinetics. a variety of interactions was demonstrated. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit s. thermophilus strains. among  probiotic cultures, lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (lb. casei and bifidobacterium). in general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. the study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). the possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and  their survival in the products during cold storage.

TI  == capsule formation by nonropy starter cultures affects the viscoelastic properties of yogurt during structure formation.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the structure formation of yogurt made with cultures containing ropy lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (r), capsule-forming nonropy streptococcus thermophilus (cnr), and noncapsule-forming  nonropy cultures (ncnr). similar gelation profiles were shown for milk fermented  by ropy and nonropy lactic cultures. the gelation point occurred at lower ph values in milk fermented with r or ncnr compared to that of milk fermented with cnr culture. differences between capsule forming ropy and nonropy cultures were observed in the aggregation behavior of the caseins. gels made with r culture had the highest maximum in loss tangent (tan delta). however, this maximum occurred at the highest ph value when cnr culture was used. the earlier gelation of milk fermented by the encapsulated nonropy strain of strep. thermophilus resulted in increased structure rearrangement as the ph dropped, interfering with the formation of a more compact structure.

TI  == activity of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of exopolysaccharide precursors in an overproducing mutant ropy strain of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the activities of some enzymes belonging to the leloir pathway, phosphoglucomutase, udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, udp-galactose 4-epimerase and  galactose 1-p uridyl transferase, were studied in a wild ropy, a non-ropy and an  overproducing mutant ropy strain of streptococcus thermophilus. these activities  were assayed over successive culture transfers along with exocellular polysaccharide (eps) production. the overproducing mutant ropy strain showed increments in polysaccharide production over successive culture transfers, as opposed to reductions in production by the wild ropy strain. the observed variations among strains in the enzyme activities that were analysed in relation  to eps production suggest their involvement in the synthesis of sugar-nucleotide  eps precursors.

TI  == autolytic phenotype of lactococcus lactis strains isolated from traditional tunisian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the autolytic properties of lactococcus lactis strains isolated from artisan tunisian dairy products, their peptidoglycan hydrolase content and their activity spectrum. methods and results: the autolytic phenotype of lactococcus strains was evaluated under starvation conditions in potassium phosphate buffer. the results obtained highlighted a high degree of diversity among the strains analysed, allowing the identification of high and low autolytic lactococcus lactis strains. peptidoglycan hydrolase content was evaluated by renaturing sds-page using cells of micrococcus lysodeikticus as a target for the  enzymatic activity. a major activity band migrating at about 45 kda was observed. the lytic activity, evaluated in the presence of different chemicals, was retained in 8% nacl, 15 mmol l(-1) cacl2, and in a ph range between 5 and 9.5. the substrate specificity of peptidoglycan hydrolase from lactococcus strains was evaluated in renaturing sds-page incorporating cells of different bacterial species. the major autolysin of lactococcus lactis was active against cells of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and listeria monocytogenes. conclusions: autolytic activity is widely distributed in lactococcus lactis and the rate of autolysis is strain-dependent. the major peptidoglycan hydrolase showed a wide spectrum of activity against several lactic acid bacteria and bacterial species involved in food-related infection. significance and impact of the study: the autolytic phenotype of lactococcus lactis strains isolated from tunisian artisan dairy products has been determined, and the data obtained should allow the selection of strains of technological interest in the cheese-ripening process.

TI  == apoptotic effects of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria on a human t leukemia cell line are associated with bacterial arginine deiminase and/or sphingomyelinase activities.
AB  == the aim of the present work was, first, to analyze the apoptotic effect in vitro  of sonicated preparations of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria on normal and tumor human lymphocytes. incubation with bacterial samples led to a relevant  time-dependent apoptotic cell death of jurkat cells but not normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. lactobacillus brevis (cd2) samples were more efficient in inducing apoptosis of jurkat cells than were samples of streptococcus thermophilus (s244). in an attempt to characterize the mechanisms underlying these effects, we found that the apoptotic death-inducing ability of s244 preparations could be attributed to the ability of high levels of neutral sphingomyelinase activity to generate relevant amounts of ceramide, a known apoptotic death messenger, in jurkat cells. on the other hand, our results indicate that apoptosis induced by cd2 samples could also be associated with high levels of arginine deiminase activity, which in turn was able to downregulate polyamine synthesis in jurkat cells.

TI  == lack of therapeutic effect of a specially designed yogurt for the eradication of  helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == background: current antibiotic treatment for helicobacter pylori infection is often associated with frequent adverse effects and resistance to antibiotics. alternative treatment methods to control h. pylori infection are needed. some specific strains of lactic acid bacteria (probiotics) in dairy products are known to inhibit the growth of h. pylori in vitro. a clinical trial was conducted to see the efficacy of a specially designed yogurt product containing specific probiotics on the eradication of h. pylori. method: the yogurt was prepared using three lactobacillus spp. (l. acidophilus and l. casei) and one commercial starter culture (l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus). all these cultures were previously evaluated, and found to have strong in vitro inhibitory  effects on the growth of h. pylori. twenty-seven asymptomatic women positive for  h. pylori on gastric biopsy and 13c urea breath test were recruited, and administered 175 ml of the yogurt three times a day for 30 days. the 13c urea breath test was administered again, one month after stopping the yogurt treatment to detect the presence of h. pylori. results: in 26 of 27 subjects, the urea breath test values remained positive, indicating that the consumption of the yogurt had no effect on the eradication of h. pylori. conclusion: although the designed fermented milk containing lactobacilli is very effective in the inhibition of h. pylori growth in vitro, eradication of this infection in humans  is difficult to achieve by consuming this product.

TI  == simulation modelling of bacterial growth in yoghurt.
AB  == indisim, an individual-based simulator, was used to specifically study the influence of the shape and size of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt processing. to this effect, two different sets of simulations were carried out. in the first set of simulations, it was assumed that the initial acidity of the medium has the same value as the acidity of the cytoplasm of the microorganisms. hence, the differences in bacterial growth by the two species are only attributable to differences in their geometry. it was found that, in an optimum culture, the growth in biomass of s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus is larger than that of l.  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. an important factor for understanding this difference might be the larger mass-to-surface ratio of the former. in the second set of simulations, a simplified model of yoghurt, the parametrisation differs both in the geometry and the metabolism of the two species. the results of these  simulations are in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental data of  [lait 69 (1989) 519]. finally, by inhibiting the uptake of amino acids by s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, the large relative importance of lactic acid in yoghurt processing was highlighted.

TI  == a novel area of predictive modelling: describing the functionality of beneficial  microorganisms in foods.
AB  == predictive microbiology generally focuses on the potential outgrowth of spoilage  bacteria and foodborne pathogens in foods. little attention has been paid to the  biokinetics of beneficial foodgrade microorganisms, such as lactic acid bacteria. the latter is commonly used in the food fermentation industry, mainly for the in  situ production of the antimicrobial lactic acid to extend the shelf life of the  food. furthermore, many strains show additional industrial potential as novel starter cultures since they produce functional metabolites, such as bacteriocins  and exopolysaccharides. the production of these functional metabolites has been demonstrated during in vitro experiments, but in many cases these novel starter cultures seem to be less efficient when applied in a food system. a modelling approach may contribute to a better understanding of the tight relation between the food environment and bacterial functionality. primary modelling can be applied to fit the experimental data concerning cell growth, sugar metabolism, and the production of functional metabolites for a given set of environmental conditions. this led to conclusions concerning the growth-associated production of bacteriocin and exopolysaccharides, the inactivation of these molecules when cell growth levels off, and a minimum cell concentration to trigger on bacteriocin production. examples deal with the production of the bacteriocin sakacin k by the natural fermented sausage isolate lactobacillus sakei ctc 494, and the production of heteropolysaccharides by the yoghurt starter culture streptococcus thermophilus ly03. secondary modelling of biokinetic parameters quantifies the production of bacteriocin and exopolysaccharides in function of environmental factors. as an example, the specific bacteriocin production by lb.  sakei ctc 494 decreases with increasing sodium chloride concentrations. furthermore, since the assessment of functionality is frequently hampered by the  nature of the food system, mathematical modelling techniques may help to predict  the functional behaviour of novel lactic acid bacteria starter cultures in a food matrix, and hence quantify in situ production. for example, a model may simulate  cell growth and exopolysaccharide production of s. thermophilus ly03 in a milk environment, where direct measurements are difficult to perform.

TI  == prediction of the adherence, growth and release of microorganisms in production chains.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop a mathematical model that describes the bacterial contamination of food as a result of adherence, growth and release of bacteria in process equipment. the model developed can be applied to control the  bacterial quality of food products produced in process chains in which the final  contamination of the product is governed by growth and heat-induced destruction of bacteria. to set up the model, experiments were carried out with a plate heat  exchanger using milk inoculated with streptococcus thermophilus. the growth rate  of s. thermophilus in milk could be described accurately by the modified expanded model of ratkowsky. the observed increase in the concentration of s. thermophilus in milk at the outlet of the plate heat exchanger could be described quantitatively by the model. to predict the contamination of the product, the model was integrated into nizo-pcs (process chain simulator). the results of computer simulations were validated by a number of measurements in a cheese factory. it turned out that the agreement between the measured and calculated concentrations of s. thermophilus was sufficient for the model to be used for predictions in industrial production chains.

TI  == diversity, dynamics, and activity of bacterial communities during production of an artisanal sicilian cheese as evaluated by 16s rrna analysis.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the microbial communities during the manufacturing  of ragusano cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in sicily (italy), were investigated by a combination of classical and culture-independent approaches. the latter included pcr, reverse transcriptase-pcr (rt-pcr), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna genes (rdna). bacterial and lactobacillus group-specific primers were used to amplify the v6 to v8 and v1 to  v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene, respectively. dgge profiles from samples taken during cheese production indicated dramatic shifts in the microbial community structure. cloning and sequencing of rdna amplicons revealed that mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab), including species of leuconostoc, lactococcus lactis, and macrococcus caseolyticus were dominant in the raw milk, while streptococcus thermophilus prevailed during lactic fermentation. other thermophilic lab, especially lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus fermentum, also flourished during ripening. comparison of the rrna-derived patterns obtained by rt-pcr to the rdna dgge patterns indicated a substantially different degree of metabolic activity for the microbial groups detected. identification of cultivated lab isolates by phenotypic characterization and 16s rdna analysis indicated a variety of species, reflecting to a large extent the results obtained from the 16s rdna clone libraries, with the significant exception of the lactobacillus delbrueckii  species, which dominated in the ripening cheese but was not detected by cultivation. the present molecular approaches combined with culture can effectively describe the complex ecosystem of natural fermented dairy products, giving useful information for starter culture design and preservation of artisanal fermented food technology.

TI  == enteroinvasive bacteria alter barrier and transport properties of human intestinal epithelium: role of inos and cox-2.
AB  == background & aims: various invasive pathogens cause diarrhea, but the mechanism(s) are poorly understood. we hypothesized that nitric oxide and prostaglandins might modulate chloride secretory and barrier properties of the infected intestinal epithelium and that diarrhea is caused, in part, by altered expression of inducible no synthase (inos) and cyclooxygenase 2 (cox-2). methods: studies were conducted in human intestinal epithelial cell lines (ht29/cl.19a, caco-2, and t84). cells were infected with enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec  029:nm) or salmonella dublin (sd), or nonpathogenic, noninvasive bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus [st] and lactobacillus acidophilus [la]). infected cells and controls were tested for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretion, prostaglandin e2, guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, and protein expression. results: cells infected with  eiec or sd, but not uninfected controls or st/la-exposed monolayers, showed a progressive reduction in transepithelial resistance starting at 6-12 hours. infected ht29/cl.19a and caco-2 cells, but not t84 cells, also showed an increase in total nitrite. expression of inos, and consequently cox-2, was also increased, followed by increased production of prostaglandins and cyclic nucleotides. furthermore, basal and stimulated chloride secretory responses to various agonists were enhanced in ht29/cl.19a and caco-2 cells after infection with enteroinvasive bacteria, and this effect was reversed for some agonists by inos or cox-2 inhibitors. increased expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and nkcc1 was also observed in eiec or sd-infected cells vs. controls, secondary to no synthase activity. conclusions: up-regulation of inos and cox-2 by enteroinvasive bacteria can modulate chloride secretion and barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells. thus, these enzymes represent possible therapeutic targets in infectious diarrhea.

TI  == effects of dairy products on heterocyclic aromatic amine-induced rat colon carcinogenesis.
AB  == heterocyclic aromatic amines (haa) are initiating agents of colon carcinogenesis  in animals and are suspected in the aetiology of human colon cancer. in the context of prevention, it seems interesting to test possible protective compounds, such as fermented milk, against haa food carcinogens. male f344 rats were used in a model of haa-induced colon carcinogenesis. the haa, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (iq), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (meiq) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (phip) (ratio 1:1:1) were administered in food for a 7 week induction period, with a cumulative dose of 250 mg of the haa, per kg body weight. four different diets were given to four rat groups: supplemented with 20% water, 30% non-fermented milk, 30% bifidobacterium  animalis dn-173 010 fermented milk and 30% streptococcus thermophilus dn-001 158  fermented milk. fecal mutagenicity was quantified during the induction period. at the end of the treatment, dna lesion levels were determined in the liver and colon using the number of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'desoxyguanosine (8-oxodguo) oxidized bases, "3d test" and comet assay. the metabolic activity of hepatic and  colon cytochrome p450 (cyp450) 1a1 and 1a2 was also evaluated. aberrant colon crypts were scored, 8 weeks after the last haa treatment. the results showed that dairy products decreased the incidence of aberrant crypts in rats: 66% inhibition with the milk-supplemented diet, 96% inhibition with the b.animalis fermented milk-supplemented diet and 93% inhibition with the s.thermophilus fermented milk-supplemented diet. intermediate biomarkers showed that there was a decrease  in haa metabolism, fecal mutagenicity and colon dna lesions. these results demonstrate the early protective effect of milk in the carcinogenesis process. this effect being more pronounced in the case of milk fermented by lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == operating conditions that affect the resistance of lactic acid bacteria to freezing and frozen storage.
AB  == thermophilic lactic acid bacteria exhibit different survival rates during freezing and frozen storage, depending on the processing conditions. we used a plackett and burman experimental design to study the effects of 13 experimental factors, at two levels, on the resistance of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to freezing and frozen storage. the resistance was evaluated by quantifying the decrease of acidification activity during freezing and throughout 8 weeks of storage. acidification activity after freezing and frozen storage was affected by 12 experimental factors. only the thawing temperature did not show any significant effect. s. thermophilus was more resistant than l. bulgaricus and the cryoprotective effect of glycerol during freezing and storage was confirmed. the temperature and duration of the cryoprotection step influenced acidification activity following the freezing step: the lower the temperature and the shorter the duration, the higher the activity. acidification activity after storage was affected by several experimental factors involved in the fermentation stage: use of naoh instead of nh4oh for ph control, addition of tween 80 in the culture medium, and faster cooling led to better cryotolerance. resistance to freezing and frozen storage was improved by using a high freezing rate and a low storage temperature. finally, this study revealed that the conditions under which lactic acid bacteria are prepared should be well controlled to improve their preservation and to limit the variability between batches and between species.

AB  == a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (nwcs) for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production. total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing dna directly extracted from the original samples of nwc. in addition, dna extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. the 16s rdna v3 region was amplified using dna from nwc as well as dna from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by dgge.  the microbial entities occurring in nwcs were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing of dgge bands: four lactic acid bacteria (lab) closest relative of streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of dna directly extracted from nwc while two other lab, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecalis,  were identified by analyzing dna from the cultivable community. the developed pcr-dgge analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from nwc and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.

TI  == enhanced exopolysaccharide production by metabolic engineering of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == it is possible that the low levels of production of exopolysaccharides (epss) by  lactic acid bacteria could be improved by altering the levels of enzymes in the central metabolism that influence the production of precursor nucleotide sugars.  to test this hypothesis, we identified and cloned the galu gene, which codes for  udp glucose pyrophosphorylase (galu) in streptococcus thermophilus ly03. homologous overexpression of the gene led to a 10-fold increase in galu activity  but did not have any effect on the eps yield when lactose was the carbon source.  however, when galu was overexpressed in combination with pgma, which encodes phosphoglucomutase (pgm), the eps yield increased from 0.17 to 0.31 g/mol of carbon from lactose. a galactose-fermenting ly03 mutant (gal(+)) with increased activities of the leloir enzymes was also found to have a higher eps yield (0.24  g/mol of carbon) than the parent strain. the eps yield was further improved to 0.27 g/mol of carbon by overexpressing galu in this strain. however, the highest  eps yield, 0.36 g/mol of carbon, was obtained when pgma was knocked out in the gal(+) strain. measurements of the levels of intracellular metabolites in the cultures revealed that the gal(+) strains had considerably higher glucose 1-phosphate levels than the other strains, and the strain lacking pgm activity had threefold-higher levels of glucose 1-phosphate than the other gal(+) strains. these results show that it is possible to increase eps production by altering the levels of enzymes in the central carbohydrate metabolism.

AB  == antisense rna complementary to a putative helicase gene (hel3.1) of a cos-type streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage was used to impede the proliferation of  a number of cos-type s. thermophilus bacteriophages and one pac-type bacteriophage. the putative helicase gene is a component of the sfi21-type dna replication module, which is found in a majority of the s. thermophilus bacteriophages of industrial importance. all bacteriophages that strongly hybridized a 689-bp internal hel3.1 probe were sensitive to the expression of antisense hel3.1 rna. a 40 to 70% reduction in efficiency of plaquing (eop) was consistently observed, with a concomitant decrease in plaque size relative to that of the s. thermophilus parental strain. when progeny were released, the burst size was reduced. growth curves of s. thermophilus nck1125, in the presence of variable levels of bacteriophage kappa3, showed that antisense hel3.1 conferred protection, even at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 1.0. when the hel3.1 antisense rna cassette was expressed in cis from the kappa3-derived phage-encoded resistance (per) plasmid ptrk690::ori3.1, the eop for bacteriophages sensitive to per and antisense targeting was reduced to between 10(-7) and 10(-8), beyond the resistance conferred by the per element alone (less than 10(-6)). these results illustrate the first successful applications of antisense rna and explosive delivery of antisense rna to inhibit  the proliferation of s. thermophilus bacteriophages.

TI  == galactose and lactose genes from the galactose-positive bacterium streptococcus salivarius and the phylogenetically related galactose-negative bacterium streptococcus thermophilus: organization, sequence, transcription, and activity of the gal gene products.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is a lactose- and galactose-positive bacterium that is phylogenetically closely related to streptococcus thermophilus, a bacterium that  metabolizes lactose but not galactose. in this paper, we report a comparative characterization of the s. salivarius and s. thermophilus gal-lac gene clusters.  the clusters have the same organization with the order galr (codes for a transcriptional regulator and is transcribed in the opposite direction), galk (galactokinase), galt (galactose-1-p uridylyltransferase), gale (udp-glucose 4-epimerase), galm (galactose mutarotase), lacs (lactose transporter), and lacz (beta-galactosidase). an analysis of the nucleotide sequence as well as northern  blotting and primer extension experiments revealed the presence of four promoters located upstream from galr, the gal operon, galm, and the lac operon of s. salivarius. putative promoters with virtually identical nucleotide sequences were found at the same positions in the s. thermophilus gal-lac gene cluster. an additional putative internal promoter at the 3' end of galt was found in s. thermophilus but not in s. salivarius. the results clearly indicated that the gal-lac gene cluster was efficiently transcribed in both species. the shine-dalgarno sequences of galt and gale were identical in both species, whereas the ribosome binding site of s. thermophilus galk differed from that of s. salivarius by two nucleotides, suggesting that the s. thermophilus galk gene might be poorly translated. this was confirmed by measurements of enzyme activities.

TI  == specific iga to lactic acid bacteria in feces of children consuming milk fermented by yoghurt symbiosis and lactobacillus casei (danone strain dn 114 001).
AB  == an immunoreactive role of lactic acid bacteria established in animals has seldom  been investigated in humans. in a large-scale clinical study, children from day-care centers received either yoghurt (y), milk fermented by yoghurt symbiosis and lactobacillus casei (dn 114 001) (yc), or gelified milk (gm) as diet supplements during two 30-day supplementation periods separated by one 30-day period without supplementation. feces samples were collected before, during, and  after the 2nd supplementation period. proteins were extracted in a buffer containing enzymatic inhibitors. iga levels were assessed and adjusted to the weight of feces samples. specific iga to lactic acid bacteria strains (streptococcus thermophilus 8901a, 8902a; lactobacillus bulgaricus; lactobacillus casei) present in y and yc were assayed in elisa and adjusted to individual iga levels. mean levels of fecal iga were within reported ranges for pediatric populations of similar age. iga levels decreased significantly but transiently in children receiving y, and increased significantly in children receiving gm, but did not vary in the group of children who were given yc. specific iga to the 4 strains tested increased significantly during the supplementation period only in  the group of children receiving gm, while it was transient and not significant in children receiving yc. no variation was noted in children given y specific iga to lactic acid bacteria can be assayed in feces. supplementation with fermented milks might induce a mucosal tolerance to environmental flora.

TI  == prediction of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus populations in yoghurt by curie point pyrolysis-mass spectrometry.
AB  == we evaluated the potential of pyrolysis-mass spectrometry (pyms) for quantifying  the binary mixed population of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt. for this purpose, a new analytical approach was developed. the yoghurt was transparised and its total bacterial population was recovered by centrifugation and estimated by turbidimetric measurement. the quantity of each population (l. bulgaricus, s. thermophilus) was then estimated in the pellet by pyms, and the data were analysed by artificial neural networks (anns). in parallel, streptococci and lactobacilli were numerated on syl agar and these data were used as reference values to predict the bacterial counts of each population by pyms. a close correlation was established between the streptococci and the lactobacilli counts  on syl agar and pyms measurements (r(2)=0.98 for s. thermophilus and r(2)=0.96 for l. bulgaricus). combined turbidimetric measurement and pyms/anns seemed to be a powerful method for obtaining rapid counts of binary mixtures of bacteria in yoghurt.

TI  == the use of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease.
AB  == probiotics are living microorganisms that can affect the host in a beneficial manner. prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth and activity of probiotic bacteria already established in the colon. efficacy of  probiotic compounds has been shown in a wide range of gastrointestinal diseases.  lactobacillus gg alone, or the combination of bifidobacterium bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus, is effective in the treatment of clostridium difficile, as well as in preventing the frequency and severity of infectious acute diarrhea in children. prevention of antibiotic-induced diarrhea with the concomitant administration of either lactobacillus gg or saccharomyces boulardii  has been demonstrated. the most successful studies involve the use of lactobacillus gg at a dose of 1 x 1010 viable organisms per day and the yeast boulardii at a dose of 1 g/day. a probiotic preparation (vsl#3 - 6 g/day) that uses a combination of three species of bifidobacterium, four strains of lactobacillus and one strain of streptocccus has shown promise in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and pouchitis, as well as in preventing the postoperative recurrence of crohn's disease. the mechanism of action of probiotics may include receptor competition, effects on mucin secretion or probiotic immunomodulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. oral administration of probiotic compounds has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and safe. however, while probiotics have the potential to improve human health and to prevent and treat some diseases, major improvements are needed in labelling and quality assurance procedures for probiotic compounds. in addition, well planned and controlled clinical studies are necessary to delineate fully the potential for probiotic compounds.

TI  == evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  == the development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partial 16s rrna genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to streptococcus thermophilus or saccharococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus fermentum. the middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus paracasei, l. fermentum, and lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by dgge during this stage. bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of  residual maltooligosaccharides. by 70 h, two new pcr bands were detected on dgge  gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. the bacteria were phylogenetically related to lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had  previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in japan. these were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as mrs. their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.

TI  == resistance to freezing and frozen storage of streptococcus thermophilus is related to membrane fatty acid composition.
AB  == the resistance to freezing and frozen storage of streptococcus thermophilus was related to the fatty acid composition of the cell membrane. the effects of four experimental factors were investigated on the fatty acid concentrations and on the recovery of acidification activity of s. thermophilus stored at -20 degrees c by using a complete experimental design: incorporating oleic acid in the culture  medium, fermentation ph, addition of glycerol as cryoprotective agent and duration of storage. the acidification activity decreased during the freezing and the frozen storage of s. thermophilus. the storage time slightly enhanced the unsaturated fatty acid concentrations. the addition of glycerol did not modify the fatty acid composition but increased the resistance to frozen storage. the addition of oleic acid and the decrease of the fermentation ph enhanced the ratio unsaturated:saturated fatty acids and improved the recovery of the acidification  activity. these results indicate that the resistance to frozen storage was closely related to the membrane fatty acid composition. we interpreted this as an adaptation of s. thermophilus to the addition of oleic acid and the unfavorable growth conditions that corresponded to a low fermentation ph.

TI  == effects of the mur1 mutation on xyloglucans produced by suspension-cultured arabidopsis thaliana cells.
AB  == mutation of the arabidopsis thaliana (l.) heynh. gene mur1, which encodes an isoform of gdp-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase, affects the biosynthetic conversion of  gdp-mannose to gdp-fucose. cell walls in the aerial tissues of mur1 plants are almost devoid of alpha-l-fucosyl residues, which are partially replaced by closely related alpha-l-galactosyl residues. a line of suspension-cultured a. thaliana cells was generated from leaves of mur1 plants and the structure of the  xyloglucan in the walls of these cells was structurally characterized. xyloglucan fractions were prepared from the walls of both wild-type (wt) and mur1 cells by sequential extraction with a xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase (xeg) and aqueous  koh. structural analysis of these fractions revealed that xyloglucan produced by  cultured mur1 cells is similar, but not identical to that isolated from leaves of mur1 plants. as previously reported for mur1 leaves, the xyloglucan from cultured mur1 cells contains less than 5% of the fucose present in the xyloglucan from wt  cells. fucosylation of the xyloglucan is substantially restored when mur1 cells are grown in medium supplemented with l-fucose. xyloglucan isolated from leaves contains more oligosaccharide subunits in which the central sidechain is terminated with a beta-d-galactosyl residue than does xyloglucan prepared from cultured cells. this was observed for both mur1 and wt plants, indicating that this correlation is independent of the mur1 mutation and that it is possible to distinguish changes due to genetic mutation from those due to the physiological state of the cells in culture. suspension-cultured cells thus provide a convenient source of genetically altered cell wall material, facilitating the biochemical characterization of mutations that affect cell wall structure.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus thermophilus strains isolated from dairy products.
AB  == aims: forty strains of streptococcus thermophilus isolated from dairy products were identified and typed by a polyphasic approach which included phenotypic and  genotypic criteria. methods and results: strains were identified by sugar fermentation pattern and species-specific pcr. phenotypic diversity was evaluated by a chemometric model taking into account some biochemical characteristics (e.g. acidifying and peptidase activities) of technological interest. genotypic diversity was evidenced by pcr fingerprinting. the overall phenotypic and genotypic information was elaborated on a multivariate statistical basis by principal components analysis and cluster analysis, respectively. when acidifying and peptidase activities were considered, pca indicated that most of the strains  isolated from pecorino toscano cheese were separable from the others. similarly,  most of the starter culture strains tended to separate from the cheese isolates.  conclusions: a wide strain heterogeneity among strep. thermophilus strains isolated from dairy products was observed. significance and impact of the study:  a computerized analysis of genotypic and phenotypic information could be applied  successfully to differentiate and characterize reliably and rapidly isolates occurring in different dairy products and to comprehend the technological role of specific strep. thermophilus strains in dairy technology.

TI  == three oligopeptide-binding proteins are involved in the oligopeptide transport of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the functions necessary for bacterial growth strongly depend on the features of the bacteria and the components of the growth media. our objective was to identify the functions essential to the optimum growth of streptococcus thermophilus in milk. using random insertional mutagenesis on a s. thermophilus strain chosen for its ability to grow rapidly in milk, we obtained several mutants incapable of rapid growth in milk. we isolated and characterized one of these mutants in which an amia1 gene encoding an oligopeptide-binding protein (obp) was interrupted. this gene was a part of an operon containing all the components of an atp binding cassette transporter. three highly homologous amia genes encoding obps work with the same components of the atp transport system. their simultaneous inactivation led to a drastic diminution in the growth rate in milk and the absence of growth in chemically defined medium containing peptides as the nitrogen source. we constructed single and multiple negative mutants for amias and cell wall proteinase (prts), the only proteinase capable of hydrolyzing casein oligopeptides outside the cell. growth experiments in chemically defined medium containing peptides indicated that amia1, amia2, and amia3 exhibited overlapping substrate specificities, and that the whole system allows the transport of peptides containing from 3 to 23 residues.

TI  == small-scale analysis of exopolysaccharides from streptococcus thermophilus grown  in a semi-defined medium.
AB  == background: exopolysaccharides (epss) produced by lactic acid bacteria are important for the texture of fermented foods and have received a great deal of interest recently. however, the low production levels of epss in combination with the complex media used for growth of the bacteria have caused problems in the accurate analysis of the eps. the purpose of this study was to find a growth medium for physiological studies of the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus, and to develop a simple method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of epss produced in this medium. results: a semi-defined polysaccharide  medium was developed and evaluated on six strains of streptococcus thermophilus.  the epss were analysed using a novel protocol incorporating ultracentrifugation for the removal of interfering sugars, hydrolysis and analysis of the monomer composition by high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. the medium and analysis method allowed accurate quantification and monomer analysis of 0.5 ml samples of epss from tube cultures. conclusions: the presented medium should be useful for physiological studies of s. thermophilus, and, in combination with the method of analysis of eps, will allow downscaling of physiological studies and screening for epss.

TI  == comparative genomics reveals close genetic relationships between phages from dairy bacteria and pathogenic streptococci: evolutionary implications for prophage-host interactions.
AB  == the genome of the highly pathogenic m1 serotype streptococcus pyogenes isolate sf370 contains eight prophage elements. only prophage sf370.1 could be induced by mitomycin c treatment. prophage sf370.3 showed a 33.5-kb-long genome that closely resembled the genome organization of the cos-site temperate siphovirus r1t infecting the dairy bacterium lactococcus lactis. the two-phage genomes shared between 60 and 70% nucleotide sequence identity over the dna packaging, head and  tail genes. analysis of the sf370.3 genome revealed mutations in the replisome organizer gene that may prevent the induction of the prophage. the mutated phage  replication gene was closely related to a virulence marker identified in recently emerged m3 serotype s. pyogenes strains in japan. this observation suggests that  prophage genes confer selective advantage to the lysogenic host. sf370.3 encodes  a hyaluronidase and a dnase that may facilitate the spreading of s. pyogenes through tissue planes of its human host. prophage sf370.2 showed a 43-kb-long genome that closely resembled the genome organization of pac-site temperate siphoviridae infecting the dairy bacteria s. thermophilus and l. lactis. over part of the structural genes, the similarity between sf370.2 and s. thermophilus  phage o1205 extended to the nucleotide sequence level. sf370.2 showed two probable inactivating mutations: one in the replisome organizer gene and another  in the gene encoding the portal protein. prophage sf370.2 also encodes a hyaluronidase and in addition two very likely virulence factors: prophage-encoded toxins acting as superantigens that may contribute to the immune deregulation observed during invasive streptococcal infections. the superantigens are encoded  between the phage lysin and the right attachment site of the prophage genome. the genes were nearly sequence identical with a dna segment in s. equi, suggesting horizontal gene transfer. the trend for prophage genome inactivation was even more evident for the remaining five prophage sequences that showed massive losses of prophage dna. in these prophage remnants only 13-0.3 kb of putative prophage dna was detected. we discuss the genomics data from s. pyogenes strain sf370 within the framework of darwinian coevolution of prophages and lysogenic bacteria and suggest elements of genetic cooperation and elements of an arms race in this  host-parasite relationship.

AB  == background: the aim of this study was to compare the effect of infant formula and the same formula subjected to microbial fermentation (yogurt) on the duration of  diarrhea in young children with acute watery diarrhea, with or without reducing substances in stools. methods: one hundred twelve well-nourished children, aged 3 to 24 months, who were admitted to the hospital with acute watery diarrhea were included in a randomized trial. after appropriate rehydration, they were fed either an infant formula (group m, n = 56) or the same formula fermented with lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus (group y, n = 56). the two feedings were comparable in lactose concentration (40 to 42 g/l), ph 4.5, flavor, and texture. the groups were subdivided into those with or without reducing sugars in stools at presentation. the presence of reducing sugars in stool was used as a marker of carbohydrate malabsorption. results: group m and group y had comparable clinical characteristics at admission, including the number of patients with reducing sugars in stools (n = 31 in group m and 27 in group y). the success rate (cessation of diarrhea and appropriate weight gain 7 days after enrollment into the study) was similar in both groups (82% in group m  vs. 84% group y). clinical failure was 3.6% in both groups. the percentage of patients withdrawn from the study for medical reasons (5.4% in group m vs. 7.1% in group y) or withdrawn at the parents' request (8.9% in group m vs. 5.4% in group y) was similar. duration of diarrhea and number of stools were significantly less in group y compared with group m. forty-eight hours after inclusion, diarrhea was still present in 62% of group m versus in 35% of group y  (p < 0.002). in children with reducing sugars in stools, the rate of success (82%) was similar in groups m and y, but the duration of diarrhea and number of stools per day were significantly decreased in group y. forty-height hours after  inclusion, diarrhea was still present in 75% of group m patients and in 20% of group y patients who had reducing substances in the stool. conclusion: young children with acute watery diarrhea, without malnutrition or associated disease,  can be equally well treated with feeding of either infant formula or yogurt. yogurt feeding is associated with a clinically relevant decrease in stool frequency and duration of diarrhea in children who have reducing sugars in stools.

AB  == aims: to determine the role of lactoperoxidase (lp) in inhibiting the growth of micro-organisms in pasteurised milk. methods and results: four micro-organisms of importance in the spoilage of pasteurized milk were challenged in lactoperoxidase (lp)-enriched ultra-heat treated (uht) milk after subsequent pasteurization. milk samples were stored at the optimum temperatures for growth of the individual bacteria. pasteurization was carried out at 72 degrees c/15 s and 80 degrees c/15 s to determine the effect of the lp system on the micro-organisms. an active lp system was found to greatly increase the keeping quality (kq) of milks inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus and pasteurized at 72 degrees c, but had little or no effect in milks heated at 80 degrees c, presumably due to virtual inactivation of lp at 80 degrees c. however, pasteurization temperature had no effect on the kq of milks challenged with bacillus cereus spores. conclusions: this study suggests that the lp system, rather than heat-shocking of spores, is responsible for the greater kq of milk pasteurized at 72 degrees c/15 s compared with 80 degrees c/15 s. significance and impact of the study: the study emphasizes the care required in selecting pasteurization temperatures in commercial practice and to avoid the temptation to compensate for inferior quality of raw milk by increasing pasteurization temperature.

TI  == reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
AB  == background: hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. we tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. methods: six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid  bacteria (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, s. thermophilus, b. infantis)  for four weeks. the 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. the ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and  the gene expression of ox1t, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange  of oxalate, also were investigated. results: the treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. mean  levels +/- sd were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3  +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (p < 0.05). the treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (l. acidophilus and s. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. one strain (b. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. l. plantarum and l. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. no strain expressed the ox1t gene. conclusions: the urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. we postulate that the biological manipulation  of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.

TI  == udp-n-acetylglucosamine 4-epimerase activity indicates the presence of n-acetylgalactosamine in exopolysaccharides of streptococcus thermophilus strains.
AB  == the monomer composition of the exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by streptococcus thermophilus ly03 and s. thermophilus sfi20 were evaluated by high-pressure liquid chromatography with amperometric detection and nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy. both strains produced the same eps composed of galactose, glucose,  and n-acetylgalactosamine. further, it was demonstrated that the activity of the  precursor-producing enzyme udp-n-acetylglucosamine 4-epimerase, converting udp-n-acetylglucosamine into udp-n-acetylgalactosamine, is responsible for the presence of n-acetylgalactosamine in the eps repeating units of both strains. the activity of udp-n-acetylglucosamine 4-epimerase was higher in both s. thermophilus strains than in a non-eps-producing control strain. however, the level of this activity was not correlated with eps yields, a result independent of the carbohydrate source applied in the fermentation process. on the other hand, both the amounts of eps and the carbohydrate consumption rates were influenced by the type of carbohydrate source used during s. thermophilus sfi20 fermentations. a correlation between activities of the enzymes alpha-phosphoglucomutase, udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and udp-galactose 4-epimerase and eps yields was seen. these experiments confirm earlier observed results for s. thermophilus ly03, although s. thermophilus sfi20 preferentially consumed glucose for eps production instead of lactose in contrast to the former  strain.

AB  == yoghurts were prepared by fermentation of soy milk using a mixed starter culture  containing lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. soy milk at 9 degrees brix was homogenised under pressure (17 mpa) and fermented with and without addition of sucrose (2.0 and 2.5 g per 100 g) for 4, 5, 6 and 7 hours. the yoghurts were evaluated in terms of sensory quality, ph, titrable acidity, phytic acid and oligosaccharides: a yoghurt with the best sensory quality was obtained using the homogenised soy milk with 2% sucrose addition and fermented for 6 h. lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus did not produce  phytases and alpha-galactosidases at the experimental conditions, consequently, phytic acid and galactosides were not affected by the process.

TI  == [viability and activity of the lactic bacteria (streptococcus salivarius ssp thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus) del yogurt en venezuela].
AB  == national and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. in venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some  commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. this research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. for this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. the  different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. these samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of ph and acidity. the absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. the succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. the data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.

TI  == streptococcus thermophilus in cheddar cheese--production and fate of galactose.
AB  == the behaviour of streptococcus thermophilus in combination with lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris or subsp. lactis mesophilic starters in experimental cheddar cheese is reported. in a standard manufacturing procedure employing a 38  degrees c cook temperature, even very low levels (0.007%) of str. thermophilus combined with normal levels of the mesophilic starter (1.7%) resulted in increased rates of acid production, the formation of significant amounts of galactose (approximately 13 mmol/kg cheese), and populations nearly equivalent to those of the mesophilic lactic starter in the curd before salting. at a 41 degrees c cook temperature, the str. thermophilus attained a higher maximum population (approximately log 8.2 colony forming units (cfu)/g) than the lc. lactis subsp. cremoris (approximately log 6.8 cfu/g) and formed more galactose (approximately 28 mmol/kg). lactobacillus rhamnosus, deliberately added to a cheese made using str. thermophilus starter and which contained 24 mmol galactose/kg at day one, utilized all the galactose during the first 3 months of  cheese ripening. adventitious non-starter lactic acid bacteria had the potential  to utilize this substrate too, and a close relationship was demonstrated between  the increase in this flora and the disapearance of the galactose. some possible consequences for cheese quality of using str. thermophilus as a starter component are discussed.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide effects on streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 cell viability.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 is an anaerobic aerotolerant bacteria and its  ability to survive under aerobic growth conditions raises the question of the existence of a putative defence system against oxidative stress. thus, survival of cnrz368 in the presence of increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide was  studied. moreover, the influence of the physiologic state of the cells, as well as that of a preexposition with sublethal doses of hydrogen peroxide, upon s. thermophilus cnrz368 survival were determined. the results suggest that s. thermophilus displays a defence system against oxidative stress and that this system is inducible.

TI  == solution structure and function of a conserved protein sp14.3 encoded by an essential streptococcus pneumoniae gene.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that causes high mortality and morbidity rates and has developed resistance to many antibiotics. the genome of s. pneumoniae has recently been completely sequenced revealing many genes encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown function. we have found that the gene encoding one such conserved protein, sp14.3, is essential for growth of s. pneumonia. since it is essential, sp14.3 represents a potential target for drug discovery. here, we describe the three-dimensional solution structure of sp14.3 as determined by nmr spectroscopy. the structure consists of two domains each with an alpha/beta-fold. the n-terminal domain contains two alpha-helices and a three-stranded beta-sheet, while the c-terminal domain is composed of one alpha-helix and a five-stranded beta-sheet. the n-terminal domain of the protein  contains a highly negatively charged surface and resembles the fold of the n-terminal domain of thermus thermophilus ribosomal protein s3. the c-terminal domain has a protein fold similar to human small nuclear ribonucleoprotein sm d3  and haloarcula marismortui ribosomal protein l21e. the two domains of the protein tumble in solution overall as a whole with an overall molecular rotational correlation time (tau(m)) of 12.9 ns at 25 degrees c. the relative orientation of the two domains is not defined by the nuclear overhauser effect data. indeed, residual dipolar couplings and the structure calculations indicate that the relative orientation of the two domains is not rigidly oriented with respect to one another in solution.

TI  == identification of a genetic determinant responsible for host specificity in streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages.
AB  == phage-host interactions remain poorly understood in lactic acid bacteria and essentially in all gram-positive bacteria. the aim of this study was to identify  the phage genetic determinant (anti-receptor) involved in the recognition of streptococcus thermophilus hosts. the complete genomic sequence of the lytic s. thermophilus phage dt1 was determined previously, and bioinformatic analysis indicated that orf18 might be the anti-receptor gene. the orf18 of six additional s. thermophilus phages was determined (dt2, dt4, md1, md2, md4 and q5) and compared with the orf18 of dt1. the deduced orf18 was divided into three domains. the first domain, which contains the n-terminal part of the protein, was conserved in all seven phages. the second domain was detected in only two phages  and flanked by a motif called collagen-like repeats. the second domain also contained a variable region (vr1). all seven phages had a third domain that consisted of the c-terminal section of the protein as well as another variable region (vr2). chimeric dt1 phages were constructed by recombination; a portion of its orf18 was replaced by the corresponding section in orf18 of the phage md4. all dt1 chimeric phages acquired the host range of phage md4. analysis of the orf18 in the chimeric phages revealed that host specificity in phages dt1 and md4 resulted from vr2. this is the first report on the identification and characterization of a phage gene involved in the host recognition process of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == detection of extracellular bound proteinase in eps-producing lactic acid bacteria cultures on skim milk agar.
AB  == aims: skim milk agar was developed to investigate extracellular cell-bound proteinase in yogurt cultures, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus. methods and results: the lact. bulgaricus cultures produced more extracellular cell-bound proteinase than did strep. thermophilus cultures. strong positive correlations between the size of the exopolysaccharide (eps) layer and extracellular cell-bound proteinase were found for both streptococcus and lactobacillus cultures. conclusion: strong positive linear relationships existed  between the eps size and colony size and the diameter of clear zone and colony size for streptococcus cultures, whereas weak positive linear relationships were  observed for lactobacillus cultures. significance and impact of the study: these  data are useful to validate the relationship between extracellular proteinase and the eps size of lab. also, a convenient medium to detect the presence of extracellular cell-bound proteinase of lab is valuable for dairy industries.

AB  == aims: to compare galactose-negative strains of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus isolated from fermented milk products and known to produce exopolysaccharides (epss). methods and results: the structures of the epss were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) and their genetic relationships determined using restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) and random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd). similar groupings were  apparent by rea and rapd, and each group produced an eps with a particular subunit structure. conclusion: although none of the strains assimilated galactose, all inserted a high proportion of galactose into their eps when grown  in skimmed milk, and fell into three distinct groups. significance and impact of  the study: this information should help in an understanding of genetic exchanges  in lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == twenty-two streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. fifteen s. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using dna homology. ten plasmids were classified within group a and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced s. thermophilus plasmids. three plasmids (group b) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups c and d). single-stranded dna was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups a, c, and d, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. the only plasmid of group c, named psmq172, was further characterized. this 4230-bp plasmid replicates in escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. comparisons with databases showed that psmq172 was related to pmv158 of streptococcus agalactiae and to pssu1 of streptococcus suis. these results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.

AB  == yoghurt is active against some human pathogens, so this experiment tested whether it is also active against the salivary microflora. a clinical trial was designed, with volunteers aged between 23 and 37 years. initially, for 8 weeks, they consumed neither yoghurt nor casein-free soybean ice cream (phase 1). they were then split randomly into test (yoghurt) and control (ice cream) groups and required to consume 125 g of these foods twice daily for 8 weeks (phase 2) and then to avoid them for the following 2 weeks (phase 3). many potential sources of microbial fluctuation were standardized. salivary samples were then collected at  regular intervals of 2 weeks. for each group and phase, the mean logarithms of the salivary counts for total viable flora, oral streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida were calculated. the prevalence of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus was also assessed. twenty test and 22 control participants completed the study. at phase 2, the mean for mutans streptococci was lower in the test than in the control group (3.6 vs. 4.0  log colony-forming units/ml; p=0.02). moreover, the mean had decreased in all test participants with high phase 1 means for lactobacilli as compared to only 36.4% of those with low phase 1 means (p=0.01). l. bulgaricus was transiently detected in three test participants during phase 2. these results suggest that yoghurt does have some activity against the salivary microflora, but this does not seem to be due to the installation of yoghurt microorganisms in the mouth.

AB  == to study the influence of phosphoglucomutase (pgm) activity on exopolysaccharide  (eps) synthesis in glucose- and lactose-growing streptococcus thermophilus, a knockout pgm mutant and a strain with elevated pgm activity were constructed. the pgma gene, encoding pgm in s. thermophilus ly03, was identified and cloned. the gene was functional in escherichia coli and was shown to be expressed from its own promoter. the pgma-deficient mutant was unable to grow on glucose, while the  mutation did not affect growth on lactose. overexpression of pgma had no significant effect on eps production in glucose-growing cells. neither deletion nor overexpression of pgma changed the growth or eps production on lactose. thus, the eps precursors in lactose-utilizing s. thermophilus are most probably formed  from the galactose moiety of lactose via the leloir pathway, which circumvents the need for a functional pgm.

TI  == comparative genomics of lactococcal phages: insight from the complete genome sequence of lactococcus lactis phage bk5-t.
AB  == lactococcus lactis phage bk5-t and streptococcus thermophilus phage sfi21, two cos-site temperate siphoviridae with 40-kb genomes, share an identical genome organization, sequence similarity at the amino acid level over about half of their genomes, and nucleotide sequence identity of 60% over the dna packaging and head morphogenesis modules. siphoviridae with similarly organized genomes and substantial protein sequence similarity were identified in several genera of low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. these phages demonstrated a gradient of relatedness ranging from nucleotide sequence similarity to protein sequence similarity to gene map similarity over the dna packaging and head morphogenesis modules. interestingly, the degree of relatedness was correlated with the evolutionary distance separating their bacterial hosts. these observations suggest elements of vertical evolution in phages. the structural genes from bk5-t shared no sequence relationships with corresponding genes/proteins from lactococcal phages belonging to distinct lactococcal phage species, including phage sk1 (phage species 936) that showed a closely related gene map. despite a clearly distinct genome organization, lactococcal phages sk1 and c2 showed nine sequence-related proteins. over the early gene cluster phage bk5-t shared nine regions of high nucleotide sequence similarity, covering at most two adjacent genes, with lactococcal phage r1t (phage species p335). over the structural genes, the closest relatives of phage r1t were not lactococcal phages belonging to other phage species, but siphoviridae from mycobacteria (high-gc-content gram-positive bacteria). evidence for recent horizontal gene transfer between distinct phage species was obtained for dairy phages, but these transfers were limited to phages infecting the same bacterial host species.

(bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

AB  == the numerous biological roles of lacnac-based oligosaccharides have led to an increased demand for these structures for biological studies. in this report, an  efficient route for the synthesis of beta-galactosides using a bacterial beta-4-galactosyltransferase/-udp-4'-gal-epimerase fusion protein is described. the lgtb gene from neisseria meningitidis and the gale gene from streptococcus thermophilus were fused and cloned into an expression vector pcw. the fusion protein transfers galactose to a variety of different glucose- and glucosamine-containing acceptors, and utilizes either udp-galactose or udp-glucose as donor substrates. a crude lysate from escherichia coli expressing  the fusion protein is demonstrated to be sufficient for the efficient preparation of galactosylated oligosaccharides from inexpensive udp-glucose in a multigram scale. lysates containing the fusion protein are also found to be useful in the production of more complex oligosaccharides in coupled reaction mixtures, e.g., in the preparation of sialosides from n-acetylglucosamine. thus, bacterially expressed fusion protein is well suited for the facile and economic preparation of natural oligosaccharides and synthetic derivatives based on the lactosamine core.

AB  == phenylalanyl-trna synthetase (phers) is unique among aminoacyl trna synthetases in that it is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two alpha-subunits and two larger beta-subunits. in prokaryotes, the alpha- and beta-subunits of phers are encoded by the genes phes and phet, respectively. in this report we describe the  isolation of a dna fragment (3.52 kb) containing the phes and phet genes from a staphylococcus aureus (wcuh29) genomic dna library. both genes, found as a part of transcriptional operon, were predicted to encode polypeptides which showed strong primary and structural similarity to prokaryotic phenylalanyl-trna synthetase alpha- and beta- subunits. we describe the high-level overexpression and purification of recombinant s. aureus phers using phes and phet genes as part of an artificial operon in escherichia coli. for comparative analysis we also report a procedure for the purification of native phers from s. aureus (oxford strain) and demonstrate that michaelis-menten parameters for both recombinant and native enzyme, at least for phenylalanine trna aminoacylation are comparable.

TI  == factors affecting capsule size and production by lactic acid bacteria used as dairy starter cultures.
AB  == the effects of sugar substrates on capsule size and production by some capsule-forming nonropy and ropy dairy starter cultures were studied. test sugars (glucose, lactose, galactose, or sucrose) were used as a sole carbohydrate source and the presence of a capsule and its size were determined by using confocal scanning laser microscopy. nonropy strains produced maximum capsule size when grown in milk. strains that did not produce capsules in milk did not produce them in any other growth medium. specific sugars required for capsule production were  strain-dependent. increasing lactose content of elliker broth from 0.5 to 5% or adding whey protein or casein digest produced larger capsules. whey protein concentrate stimulated production of larger capsules than did casamino acids or casitone. some streptococcus thermophilus strains produced capsules when grown on galactose only. nonropy strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus produced capsules on lactose, but not on glucose. a ropy strain of lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus produced a constant capsule size regardless of the  growth medium. the ability of some strains of streptococcus thermophilus to use galactose in capsule production could reduce browning of mozzarella cheese during baking by removing a source of reducing sugar. media that do not support capsule  production may improve cell harvesting.

TI  == effects of ingestion of yogurts containing bifidobacterium and lactobacillus acidophilus on spleen and peyer's patch lymphocyte populations in the mouse.
AB  == certain probiotic lactic acid bacteria have been reported to improve immune system function. here, the effects of ingesting yogurts on lymphocyte populations in the spleens and peyer's patches were determined in mice. three probiotic-supplemented yogurts containing streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium, and lactobacillus acidophilus and one  conventional yogurt containing only s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus were prepared from commercial starter cultures and used in the study. b6c3f1 female mice were fed the four different types of yogurts mixed with an ain-93g diet in a 50:50 (wt/wt) ratio. nonfat dry milk mixed at a 50:50 (wt/wt) ratio with ain-93g  diet was used as the control. after a 14-day feeding period, spleen and peyer's patches were removed and lymphocytes subjected to phenotype analysis by flow cytometry. ingestion of the four yogurts had no effect on percentages of cd8+ (cytotoxic t cells), b220+ (b cells), iga+, or igm+ cells in spleen or peyer's patches. the percentage of cd4+ (t helper) cells was significantly increased in the spleens from one group of mice fed a yogurt containing bifidobacterium and l. acidophilus, and a similar trend was found in the remaining two probiotic-supplemented yogurts. effects on cd4+ populations were not observed in  spleens of mice fed conventional yogurt or in the peyer's patches of any of the four yogurt groups. in total, the results suggested that ingestion of conventional or probiotic-supplemented yogurts for 2 weeks had very little effect on lymphocyte distribution in the systemic or mucosal immune compartments.

TI  == isolation and characterization of the exopolysaccharide produced by streptococcus thermophilus sfi20.
AB  == this paper reports isolation, structural characterization and some physico-chemical properties in aqueous solution of the exopolysaccharide (eps) produced by streptococcus thermophilus strain sfi20. the yield of the purified eps was found to be reproducible and close to the average value of 143 mg/l. the  chemical structure, previously suggested, has been confirmed on the basis of nmr  data. viscometric, chiro-optical and rheological measurements have been carried out with the aim of characterizing the conformational state of the polysaccharide in aqueous solution. all the data reported indicate that the eps does not undergo a cooperative conformational transition under the investigated experimental conditions. furthermore, the viscosity data and the viscoelastic behaviour suggest that the polymer is rather flexible and adopts a random coil conformation in aqueous solution.

TI  == influence of a probiotic yoghurt on the status of vitamins b(1), b(2) and b(6) in the healthy adult human.
AB  == background/aims: the main reason for this study was to determine whether yoghurt  bacteria, being rich in some water-soluble vitamins, release them or utilize vitamins from their surroundings. our study was trying to determine for the first time, if the viable bacteria of probiotic yoghurt are able to influence the parameters of the b-vitamin (b(1), b(2), b(6)) status of the healthy adult human. methods: the test yoghurt was commercially available probiotic yoghurt prepared with streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus acidophilus, enriched with lactobacillus casei gg. different chemical forms of all investigated b-vitamins were determined by hplc methods. in order to determine the influence of the yoghurt flora, each of 12 subjects consumed four yoghurt portions 125 g each ( =  500 g) a day, containing thermally inactivated cultures during the first 2-week period and yoghurt without heat treatment during the second 2-week period. results: the heat treatment of the probiotic yoghurt caused negligible changes in vitamin contents. the plasma levels of thiamin decreased significantly (p < 0.01) after the first 2-week period and kept on decreasing during the second 2-week period. a similar trend was found in the urinary excretion. the plasma levels of  the b(2)-vitamers were different. the flavin adenine dinucleotide concentrations  increased significantly (p < 0.01) after the consumption of heat-treated yoghurt  and decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after the following 2 weeks, in which the  subjects received the untreated yoghurt. in contrast, the flavin mononucleotide plasma levels decreased during the first 2-week period and increased during the second part of the study, but the change was not statistically significant. the free riboflavin concentrations in plasma and urine showed a continuous but not significant increase. the concentrations of pyridoxal-5-phosphate in plasma increased after the consumption of yoghurt with the inactivated bacteria and decreased in the second part of the study. however, the differences were not significant. the excretion of thiamin, b(2)- and b(6)-vitamers in the faeces did  not significantly change throughout the study period (p>0.05). conclusions: our observations show that the bacterial flora of the examined yoghurt does not influence the vitamin b(1), b(2) and b(6) status of man. it seems likely that even lactobacilli of the 'probiotic' type which are vitamin b consumers can decrease the bioavailability of these vitamins for man. obviously a thermal death of the cells did not induce a release of physiologically active vitamins.

TI  == analysis of the genetic switch and replication region of a p335-type bacteriophage with an obligate lytic lifestyle on lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the dna sequence of the replication module, part of the lysis module, and remnants of a lysogenic module from the lytic p335 species lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 was determined, and its regulatory elements were investigated. the identification of a characteristic genetic switch including two divergent promoters and two cognate repressor genes strongly indicates that phi31 was derived from a temperate bacteriophage. regulation of the two early promoters was analyzed by primer extension and transcriptional promoter fusions to a laclm  reporter. the regulatory behavior of the promoter region differed significantly from the genetic responses of temperate lactococcus lactis phages. the cro gene homologue regulates its own production and is an efficient repressor of ci gene expression. no detectable ci gene expression could be measured in the presence of cro. ci gene expression in the absence of cro exerted minor influences on the regulation of the two promoters within the genetic switch. homology comparisons revealed a replication module which is most likely expressed from the promoter located upstream of the cro gene homologue. the replication module encoded genes  with strong homology to helicases and primases found in several streptococcus thermophilus phages. downstream of the primase homologue, an at-rich noncoding origin region was identified. the characteristics and location of this region and its ability to reduce the efficiency of plaquing of phi31 10(6)-fold when present at high copy number in trans provide evidence for identification of the phage origin of replication. phage phi31 is an obligately lytic phage that was isolated from commercial dairy fermentation environments. neither a phage attachment site  nor an integrase gene, required to establish lysogeny, was identified, explaining its lytic lifestyle and suggesting its origin from a temperate phage ancestor. several regions showing extensive dna and protein homologies to different temperate phages of lactococcus, lactobacillus, and streptococcus were also discovered, indicating the likely exchange of dna cassettes through horizontal gene transfer in the dynamic ecological environment of dairy fermentations.

TI  == isolation, characterization, and influence of native, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria on cheddar cheese quality.
AB  == to determine whether adventitious nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) might affect cheese flavor and quality, we studied a population of nslab present in 30  premium quality cheddar cheeses (3-mo ripened) produced at a commercial facility  in the united states. dna fingerprinting analysis with a sensitive strategy for arbitrary priming polymerase chain reaction showed that 75 isolates corresponded  to at least 18 distinct nonstarter organisms. according to ribotype database comparisons of representatives from the 18 groups, 9 matched lactobacillus (closest to paracasei species), 8 matched streptococcus thermophilus, and 1 matched to a lactococcus species. this finding indicated that among the 75 nslab  isolates, lactobacillus made up 64%, s. thermophilus 32%, and lactococcus 4%. isolates representing 11 nslab groups were characterized for protease, peptidase, and diacetyl production. based on this phenotypic analysis, two lactobacillus isolates were evaluated as adjuncts in cheddar cheese. all of the nslab identified from the adjunct cheese at 3 mo by dna fingerprinting consisted of the adjunct lactobacilli, showing that the adjunct strains predominated throughout the early stages of ripening. the impact of adjunct lactobacilli was evident after 6 mo when free amino acids significantly increased and sensory scores improved in adjunct cheese as compared with a control cheese. the largest impact  was found in adjunct cheese containing a blend of both lactobacilli strains. these results show that certain adventitious nslab positively contribute to flavor development.

TI  == characterization by molecular cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding an aminopeptidase from listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == the pepc gene of listeria monocytogenes encodes aminopeptidase c that is predicted to share 72% amino acid sequence similarity and 53% sequence identity with the cysteine aminopeptidase pepc from lactococcus lactis. the gene product also shows strong similarity to aminopeptidase c from streptococcus thermophilus  and lactobacillus helveticus, and to a cysteine proteinase/bleomycin hydrolase from saccharomyces cerevisiae. the enzyme from l. monocytogenes displayed broad n-terminal hydrolytic activity, with a similar substrate specificity to its lactic acid bacterial counterpart. the inhibition spectrum shows a great deal of  similarity with enzymes from the family of lactic acid bacteria. in addition, one of the clones studied contained dna sequences that could encode a regulatory protein of the deor helix-turn-helix dna binding protein family. the organization of the locus, designated pep, is presented along with the characterization of the gene products of the pep locus.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

TI  == genetic loci of streptococcus mitis that mediate binding to human platelets.
AB  == the direct binding of bacteria to platelets is a postulated major interaction in  the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. to identify bacterial components that mediate platelet binding by streptococcus mitis, we screened a tn916deltae-derived mutant library of s. mitis strain sf100 for reduced binding to human platelets in vitro. two distinct loci were found to affect platelet binding. the first contains a gene (pblt) encoding a highly hydrophobic, 43-kda protein with 12 potential membrane-spanning segments. this protein resembles members of the major facilitator superfamily of small-molecule transporters. the  second platelet binding locus consists of an apparent polycistronic operon. this  region includes genes that are highly similar to those of lactococcus lactis phage r1t and streptococcus thermophilus phage 01205. two genes (pbla and pblb) encoding large surface proteins are also present. the former encodes a 107-kda protein containing tryptophan-rich repeats, which may serve to anchor the protein within the cell wall. the latter encodes a 121-kda protein most similar to a tail fiber protein from phage 01205. functional mapping by insertion-duplication mutagenesis and gene complementation indicates that pblb may be a platelet adhesin and that expression of pblb may be linked to that of pbla. the combined data indicate that at least two genomic regions contribute to platelet binding by s. mitis. one encodes a probable transmembrane transporter, while the second encodes two large surface proteins resembling structural components of lysogenic  phages.

TI  == analysis of six prophages in lactococcus lactis il1403: different genetic structure of temperate and virulent phage populations.
AB  == we report the genetic organisation of six prophages present in the genome of lactococcus lactis il1403. the three larger prophages (36-42 kb), belong to the already described p335 group of temperate phages, whereas the three smaller ones  (13-15 kb) are most probably satellites relying on helper phage(s) for multiplication. these data give a new insight into the genetic structure of lactococcal phage populations. p335 temperate phages have variable genomes, sharing homology over only 10-33% of their length. in contrast, virulent phages have highly similar genomes sharing homology over >90% of their length. further analysis of genetic structure in all known groups of phages active on other bacterial hosts such as escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium: and streptococcus thermophilus confirmed the existence of two types of genetic structure related to the phage way of life. this might reflect different intensities of horizontal dna exchange: low among purely virulent phages and high among temperate phages and their lytic homologues. we suggest that the constraints on genetic exchange among purely virulent phages reflect their optimal genetic organisation, adapted to a more specialised and extreme form of parasitism than temperate/lytic phages.

TI  == activation of silent gal genes in the lac-gal regulon of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus strain cnrz 302 is unable to ferment galactose, neither that generated intracellularly by lactose hydrolysis nor the free sugar.  nevertheless, sequence analysis and complementation studies with escherichia coli demonstrated that strain cnrz 302 contained structurally intact genes for the leloir pathway enzymes. these were organized into an operon in the order galkte,  which was preceded by a divergently transcribed regulator gene, galr, and followed by a galm gene and the lactose operon lacsz. results of northern blot analysis showed that the structural gal genes were transcribed weakly, and only in medium containing lactose, by strain cnrz 302. however, in a spontaneous galactose-fermenting mutant, designated nz302g, the galkte genes were well expressed in cells grown on lactose or galactose. in both cnrz 302 and the gal(+) mutant nz302g, the transcription of the galr gene was induced by growth on lactose. disruption of galr indicated that it functioned as a transcriptional activator of both the gal and lac operons while negatively regulating its own expression. sequence analysis of the gal promoter regions of nz302g and nine other independently isolated gal(+) mutants of cnrz 302 revealed mutations at three positions in the galk promoter region, which included substitutions at positions -9 and -15 as well as a single-base-pair insertion at position -37 with respect to the main transcription initiation point. galactokinase activity measurements and analysis of gusa reporter gene fusions in strains containing the mutated promoters suggested that they were gal promoter-up mutations. we propose  that poor expression of the gal genes in the galactose-negative s. thermophilus cnrz 302 is caused by naturally occurring mutations in the galk promoter.

TI  == protective role of probiotics and prebiotics in colon cancer.
AB  == ingestion of viable probiotics or prebiotics is associated with anticarcinogenic  effects, one mechanism of which is the detoxification of genotoxins in the gut. this mechanism was shown experimentally in animals with use of the rat colon carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine and by determining endpoints that range from tumorigenesis to induction of dna damage. because of the complexity of cancer initiation, cancer progression, and the exposure of cancer in the gut, many types of interactions may be envisaged. notably, some of our newer studies showed that  short-lived metabolite mixtures isolated from milk that was fermented with strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus are more effective in deactivating etiologic risk factors of colon carcinogenesis than are cellular components of microorganisms. ingestion of prebiotics results in a different spectrum of fermentation products, including the production of high concentrations of short-chain fatty acids. gut flora, especially after the ingestion of resistant starch, induces the chemopreventive enzyme glutathione transferase pi in the colon of the rat. together, these factors lead to a reduced load of genotoxic agents in the gut and to an increased production of agents that deactivate toxic components. butyrate is one such protective agent and is associated with lowering cancer risk. it was recently shown that buytrate may inhibit the genotoxic activity of nitrosamides and hydrogen peroxide in human colon cells. in humans, the ingestion of probiotics leads to the excretion of urine with low concentrations of components that are genotoxic in human colon cells and high concentrations of components that induce oxidized dna bases.

TI  == molecular properties of streptococcus thermophilus plasmid per35 encoding a restriction modification system.
AB  == bacteriophage attack on lactic fermentation bacteria (lfb) is costly to the dairy industry because it results in product loss. one mechanism used by lfb to protect themselves from bacteriophage attack is restriction of foreign dna. three plasmids, per16, per35, and per36, from three different strains of the thermotolerant dairy fermentation bacterium streptococcus thermophilus were sequenced. one of these plasmids, per35, isolated from s. thermophilus st135, encoded a type ic restriction-modification (r-m) system very similar to those encoded on plasmids pil2614 in lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and pnd861 in lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis. the high degree of identity between the  r-m systems encoded on per35, pil2614, and pnd861 indicated the potential for horizontal transfer of these genes between different species of lactic fermentation bacteria. similar to the functional r-m system encoded on pil2614 that protects the mesophilic l. lactis subsp. lactis against phage attack, the r-m system on per35 most likely functions in the same role in s. thermophilus st135. the plasmid per16 was found to encode the specificity subunit of the r-m system, but not the r or m subunits. in addition, all three plasmids encoded proteins that are present on other s. thermophilus plasmids, including a protein  for rolling-circle replication (repa) and a low-molecular-weight stress protein (hsp). the presence of a complete r-m system encoded on a plasmid in s. thermophilus, a species that often lacks plasmids, is novel and may be beneficial for protecting s. thermophilus from bacteriophage attack under dairy fermentation conditions.

AB  == a simple protocol was designed and applied to obtain streptococcus thermophilus purified cell walls. to identify the structures involved in phage adsorption, the cell walls of two strep. thermophilus strains were treated with sodium dodecyl sulphate and proteinase k. these treatments did not reduce the adsorption of phages cym and 0bj to the cell walls of strep. thermophilus ysd10 and strep. thermophilus bj15, respectively. however, phage binding was reduced when the cell envelopes were treated with mutanolysin or trichloroacetic acid 5%, suggesting that the phage receptor component is part of the peptidoglycan or a polymer closely linked to it. the ability of several saccharides to inactivate both phages was also assayed. these phage inhibition experiments suggested that the phage cym adsorbed to a component involving glucosamine and rhamnose, while glucosamine and ribose interfered with the adsorption of phage 0bj.

AB  == bacteria have always been considered ideal organisms for genetic analysis. while  this is true for some model organisms, like escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and, more recently, lactococcus lactis, genetic analysis of other organisms is often prevented by lack of valuable tools, like vectors, transposons and methods  for transformation, gene inactivation and random insertional mutagenesis. this is the case of the moderately thermophilic bacterium streptococcus thermophilus, an  organism that, in spite of its widespread use for food fermentations, is only poorly characterized. we report here an insertional mutagenesis system that allows efficient random mutagenesis, easy characterization of the interrupted genes and construction of stable null mutations. this may become a powerful s. thermophilus tool for both genetic analysis and construction of 'food-grade' mutants of this biotechnologically relevant microorganism.

AB  == background: ingestion of fermented dairy products induces changes in the equilibrium and metabolism of the intestinal microflora and may thus have beneficial effects on the host. objective: we compared the effects of chronic consumption of yogurt with (fresh) or without (heated) live bacterial cultures (lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) on plasma glucose, insulin, triacylglycerols, cholesterol, fatty acids, and short-chain fatty acids. design: two groups of 12 healthy men with or without lactose malabsorption were selected with use of a breath-hydrogen test after a 30-g lactose load. subjects were randomly assigned in a crossover design to 500 g/d of either fresh or heated yogurt for 2 periods of 15 d each, separated by a 15-d washout interval. results: chronic consumption of fresh or heated yogurt had no detrimental effects on plasma glucose, insulin, or fatty acid areas under the curve in response to acute ingestion of 500 g yogurt in healthy men with or without lactose malabsorption. there were also no detectable changes in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, fatty acid, triacylglycerol, or cholesterol concentrations. in contrast, plasma butyrate was higher (p: < 0.03) and plasma propionate tended to be higher (p: = 0.059) in subjects without lactose malabsorption after fresh yogurt consumption than after heated yogurt consumption. there were no significant changes in plasma acetate. in subjects with lactose malabsorption, 15 d of fresh yogurt consumption also increased propionate production compared with values at baseline (p: < 0.04). in the same group, the production of breath hydrogen was lower after fresh yogurt consumption than after heated yogurt consumption (p: < 0.01). conclusions: in men with lactose malabsorption, chronic consumption of yogurt containing live  bacterial cultures ameliorated the malabsorption, as evidenced by lower breath-hydrogen excretion, but increased propionate concentrations. in subjects without lactose malabsorption, such yogurt tended to increase propionate and increased butyrate.

TI  == hydrolysis of sequenced beta-casein peptides provides new insight into peptidase  activity from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and highlights intrinsic resistance of phosphopeptides.
AB  == the peptidases of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria have a key role in the proteolysis of swiss cheeses during warm room ripening. to compare their peptidase activities toward a dairy substrate, a tryptic/chymotryptic hydrolysate of purified beta-casein was used. thirty-four peptides from 3 to 35 amino acids,  including three phosphorylated peptides, constitute the beta-casein hydrolysate,  as shown by tandem mass spectrometry. cell extracts prepared from lactobacillus helveticus itg lh1, itg lh77, and cnrz 32, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis itg ll14 and itg ll51, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cnrz 397 and ncdo  1489, and streptococcus thermophilus cnrz 385, cip 102303, and ta 060 were standardized in protein. the peptidase activities were assessed with the beta-casein hydrolysate as the substrate at ph 5.5 and 24 degrees c (conditions of warm room ripening) by (i) free amino acid release, (ii) reverse-phase chromatography, and (iii) identification of undigested peptides by mass spectrometry. regardless of strain, l. helveticus was the most efficient in hydrolyzing beta-casein peptides. interestingly, cell extracts of s. thermophilus were not able to release a significant level of free proline from the beta-casein hydrolysate, which was consistent with the identification of numerous dipeptides  containing proline. with the three lactic acid bacteria tested, the phosphorylated peptides remained undigested or weakly hydrolyzed indicating their high intrinsic resistance to peptidase activities. finally, several sets of peptides differing by a single amino acid in a c-terminal position revealed the presence of at least one carboxypeptidase in the cell extracts of these species.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria are nutritionally demanding bacteria which need, among other things, amino acids for optimal growth. we identified the branched-chain amino acid (bcaa) biosynthesis pathway as an essential pathway for optimal growth of streptococcus thermophilus in milk. through random insertional mutagenesis, we isolated and characterized two mutants for which growth in milk is affected as a  consequence of ilvb and ilvc gene interruptions. this situation demonstrates that the bcaa biosynthesis pathway is active in s. thermophilus. bcaa biosynthesis is  necessary but not sufficient for optimal growth of s. thermophilus and is subject to retro-inhibition processes. the specificity of the bcaa biosynthesis pathway in s. thermophilus lies in the independent transcription of the ilvc gene encoding a keto acid reductoisomerase acting on acetolactate at the junction of the bcaa and acetoin biosynthesis pathways. the possible advantages for s. thermophilus of keeping this biosynthesis pathway active could be linked either to adaptation of the organism to milk, which is different than that of other dairy bacteria, or to the role of the pathway in maintaining the internal ph.

TI  == the complete cps gene cluster from streptococcus thermophilus ncfb 2393 involved  in the biosynthesis of a new exopolysaccharide.
AB  == the cpsfghijkl genes from the cps cluster of streptococcus thermophilus ncfb 2393 involved in the biosynthesis of eps were identified, cloned and nucleotide sequenced. the complete cps cluster is contained on an approximately 11.2 kb chromosomal region which contains 12 orfs, including the previously cloned cpsabcde genes. functions were assigned to some of the predicted gene products on the basis of homology to known sequences as follows: cpsk encodes a protein thought to be involved in the polymerization and export of the polysaccharide; cpse, cpsf, cpsg, cpsh, cpsi and cpsj encode putative sugar transferases. two insertion sequences, is1193 and iss1, were identified within and flanking the 3'  end of the cps cluster respectively. analysis of the expression of the cpse gene  in escherichia coli demonstrated that it encodes a glucose-1-phosphate transferase; the enzyme which catalyses the first step in eps biosynthesis in s.  thermophilus ncfb 2393.

TI  == streptococcus thermophilus cell wall-anchored proteinase: release, purification,  and biochemical and genetic characterization.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus cnrz 385 expresses a cell envelope proteinase (prts),  which is characterized in the present work, both at the biochemical and genetic levels. since prts is resistant to most classical methods of extraction from the  cell envelopes, we developed a three-step process based on loosening of the cell  wall by cultivation of the cells in the presence of glycine (20 mm), mechanical disruption (with alumina powder), and enzymatic treatment (lysozyme). the pure enzyme is a serine proteinase highly activated by ca(2+) ions. its activity was optimal at 37 degrees c and ph 7.5 with acetyl-ala-ala-pro-phe-paranitroanilide as substrate. the study of the hydrolysis of the chromogenic and casein substrates indicated that prts presented an intermediate specificity between the  most divergent types of cell envelope proteinases from lactococci, known as the pi and piii types. this result was confirmed by the sequence determination of the regions involved in substrate specificity, which were a mix between those of pi and piii types, and also had unique residues. sequence analysis of the prts encoding gene revealed that prts is a member of the subtilase family. it is a multidomain protein which is maturated and tightly anchored to the cell wall via  a mechanism involving an lpxtg motif. prts bears similarities to cell envelope proteinases from pyogenic streptococci (c5a peptidase and cell surface proteinase) and lactic acid bacteria (prtp, prth, and prtb). the highest homologies were found with streptococcal proteinases which lack, as prts, one domain (the b domain) present in cell envelope proteinases from all other lactic  acid bacteria.

TI  == biodegradability of food-associated extracellular polysaccharides.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) produced by lactic acid bacteria, which are common in fermented foods, are claimed to have various beneficial physiological effects on  humans. although the biodegradability of epss is important in relation to the bioactive properties, knowledge on this topic is limited. therefore, the biodegradability of eight epss, six of which were produced by lactic acid bacteria, was compared with microorganisms from human feces or soil. eps-degradation was determined from the decrease in polysaccharide-sugar concentration and by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (hpsec). xanthan, clavan, and the epss produced by streptococcus thermophilus sfi 39 and sfi 12 were readily degraded, in contrast to the epss produced by lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris b40, lactobacillus sakei 0-1, s. thermophilus sfi20, and lactobacillus helveticus lh59. clearly, the susceptibility of exopolysaccharides  to biological breakdown can differ greatly, implying that the physiological effects of these compounds may also vary a lot.

TI  == control of lactose transport, beta-galactosidase activity, and glycolysis by ccpa in streptococcus thermophilus: evidence for carbon catabolite repression by a non-phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system sugar.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus, unlike many other gram-positive bacteria, prefers lactose over glucose as the primary carbon and energy source. moreover, lactose is not taken up by a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (pts) but by the dedicated transporter lacs. in this paper we show that ccpa plays a crucial role in the fine-tuning of lactose transport, beta-galactosidase  (lacz) activity, and glycolysis to yield optimal glycolytic flux and growth rate. a catabolite-responsive element (cre) was identified in the promoter of the lacsz operon, indicating a possible role for regulation by ccpa. transcriptional analysis showed a sevenfold relief of repression in the absence of a functional ccpa when cells were grown on lactose. this ccpa-mediated repression of lacsz transcription did not occur in wild-type cells during growth on galactose, taken  up by the same lacs transport system. lactose transport during fermentation was increased significantly in strains carrying a disrupted ccpa gene. moreover, a ccpa disruption strain was found to release substantial amounts of glucose into the medium when grown on lactose. transcriptional analysis of the ldh gene showed that expression was induced twofold during growth on lactose compared to glucose  or galactose, in a ccpa-dependent manner. a reduced rate of glycolysis concomitant with an increased lactose transport rate could explain the observed expulsion of glucose in a ccpa disruption mutant. we propose that ccpa in s. thermophilus acts as a catabolic regulator during growth on the preferred non-pts sugar lactose. in contrast to other bacteria, s. thermophilus possesses an overcapacity for lactose uptake that is repressed by ccpa to match the rate-limiting glycolytic flux.

TI  == purification, characterisation, cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding oligopeptidase pepo from streptococcus thermophilus a.
AB  == the oligopeptidase pepo from streptococcus thermophilus a was purified to protein homogeneity by a five-step chromatography procedure. it was estimated to be a serine metallopeptidase of 70 kda, with maximal activity at ph 6.5 and 41 degrees c. pepo has endopeptidase activity on oligopeptides composed of between five and  30 amino acids. pepo was demonstrated to be active and stable at the ph, temperature and salt concentrations found in swiss-type cheese during ripening. using a battery of pcr techniques, the pepo gene was amplified, subcloned and sequenced, revealing an open reading frame of 1893 nucleotides. the amino acid sequence analysis of the pepo gene-translation product shows homology with pepo enzymes from other lactic acid bacteria and contains the signature sequence of the metallopeptidase family.

TI  == influence of capsular and ropy exopolysaccharide-producing streptococcus thermophilus on mozzarella cheese and cheese whey.
AB  == we investigated the effect of capsular and ropy exopolysaccharide-producing streptococcus thermophilus starter bacteria on mozzarella cheese functionality and whey viscosity. mozzarella cheeses were manufactured with lactobacillus helveticus lh100 paired with one of four s. thermophilus strains: mr-1c, a bacterium that produces a capsular exopolysaccharide; mtc360, a strain that secretes a ropy exopolysaccharide; tao61, a nonexopolysaccharide-producing commercial cheese starter; and dm10, a nonencapsulated, exopolysaccharide-negative mutant of strain mr-1c. as expected, cheese moisture levels were significantly higher in mozzarella cheeses made with exopolysaccharide-positive versus exopolysaccharide-negative streptococci, and melt properties were better in the higher moisture cheeses. whey viscosity measurements showed that unconcentrated and ultrafiltered, fivefold concentrated  whey from cheeses made with s. thermophilus mtc360 were significantly more viscous than whey from cheeses made with mr-1c, tao61, or dm10. no significant differences were noted between the viscosity of unconcentrated or concentrated whey from cheeses made with s. thermophilus mr-1c versus the industrial cheese starter tao61. these data indicate that encapsulated, but not ropy, exopolysaccharide-producing s. thermophilus strains can be utilized to increase the moisture level of cheese and to improve the melt properties of mozzarella cheese without adversely affecting whey viscosity.

(one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms,  yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had  a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == comparative genomics of the late gene cluster from lactobacillus phages.
AB  == three prophage sequences were identified in the lactobacillus johnsoni strain ncc533. prophage lj965 predicted a gene map very similar to those of pac-site streptococcus thermophilus phages over its dna packaging and head and tail morphogenesis modules. sequence similarity linked the putative dna packaging and  head morphogenesis genes at the protein level. prophage lj965/s. thermophilus phage sfi11/lactococcus lactis phage tp901-1 on one hand and lactobacillus delbrueckii phage ll-h/lactobacillus plantarum phage phig1e/listeria monocytogenes phage a118 on the other hand defined two sublines of structural gene clusters in pac-site siphoviridae from low-gc gram-positive bacteria. bacillus subtilis phage spp1 linked both sublines. the putative major head and tail proteins from lj965 shared weak sequence similarity with phages from gram-negative bacteria. a clearly independent line of structural genes in siphoviridae from low-gc gram-positive bacteria is defined by temperate cos-site  phages including lactobacillus gasseri phage adh, which also shared sequence similarity with phage d3 infecting a gram-negative bacterium. a phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that the clpp-like protein identified in four cos-site siphoviridae from lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and pseudomonas showed graded sequence relationships. the tree suggested that the clpp-like proteins from the phages were not acquired by horizontal gene transfer from their corresponding bacterial hosts.

TI  == broad-range bacteriophage resistance in streptococcus thermophilus by insertional mutagenesis.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium used in industrial milk fermentation. to obtain phage-resistant starters, s. thermophilus strain sfi1 was submitted to mutagenesis with the thermolabile insertional vector pg(+)host9:iss1 followed by a challenge with the lytic s. thermophilus phage sfi19. vector insertions into four distinct sites led to a phage-resistance phenotype. three mutants were characterized further. they were protected against the homologous challenging phage and 14 heterologous phages. all three mutants adsorbed phages.  no intracellular phage dna synthesis was observed in mutants r7 and r71, while mutant r24 showed a delayed and diminished phage dna synthesis compared to the parental sfi1 strain. in mutant r7 a short deletion occurred next to the insertion site which removed the upstream sequences and the 15 initial codons from orf 394, encoding a likely transmembrane protein. analogy with other phage systems suggests an involvement of this protein in the phage dna injection process. in mutant r24 the vector was inserted into orf 269 predicting an oxido-reductase. when the vector sequence was removed via homologous recombination across the duplicated insertion elements, mutant r24 returned to the phage susceptibility of the parental strain. this observation suggested that  inactivation of orf 269 was not crucial for the resistance phenotype. a gene encoding a likely restriction subunit of a type i restriction-modification system was located directly downstream of the insertion site in mutant r24. hsdm and hsds genes encoding the modification and specificity subunits of a type i r-m system and biological evidence for an active r-m system were detected in strain sfi1, suggesting involvement of a type i r-m system in the resistance phenotype of r24.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.

AB  == the effects of different carbohydrates or mixtures of carbohydrates as substrates on bacterial growth and exopolysaccharide (eps) production were studied for the yoghurt starter culture streptococcus thermophilus ly03. this strain produces two heteropolysaccharides with the same monomeric composition (galactose and glucose  in the ratio 4:1) but with different molecular masses. lactose and glucose were fermented by s. thermophilus ly03 only when they were used as sole energy and carbohydrate sources. fructose was also fermented when it was applied in combination with lactose or glucose. both the amount of eps produced and the carbohydrate source consumption rates were clearly influenced by the type of energy and carbohydrate source used, while the eps monomeric composition remained constant (galactose-glucose, 4:1) under all circumstances. a combination of lactose and glucose resulted in the largest amounts of eps. measurements of the activities of enzymes involved in eps biosynthesis, and of those involved in sugar nucleotide biosynthesis and the embden-meyerhof-parnas pathway, demonstrated that the levels of activity of alpha-phosphoglucomutase, udp-galactose 4-epimerase, and udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase are highly correlated with the amount of eps produced. furthermore, a weaker relationship or no relationship between the amounts of eps and the enzymes involved in either the rhamnose nucleotide synthetic branch of the eps biosynthesis or the pathway leading to glycolysis was observed for s. thermophilus ly03.

TI  == quaternary structure of the lactose transport protein of streptococcus thermophilus in the detergent-solubilized and membrane-reconstituted state.
AB  == the quaternary structure of lacs, the lactose transporter of streptococcus thermophilus, has been determined for the detergent-solubilized and the membrane-reconstituted state of the protein. the quaternary structure of the n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside-solubilized state was studied using a combination of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium centrifugation analysis. from these measurements it followed that the detergent-solubilized lacs undergoes reversible self-association with a monomer to dimer mode of association. the association constants were 5.4 +/- 3.6 and 4.4 +/- 1.0 ml mg(-1) as determined from the velocity and equilibrium sedimentation measurements, respectively. the experiments did not indicate significant changes in the shape of the protein-detergent complex or the amount of detergent bound in going from the monomeric to dimeric state of lacs. importantly, a single cys mutant of lacs is labeled by 2-(4'-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid in a substrate-dependent manner, indicating that the detergent-solubilized protein exhibits ligand binding activity. the quaternary structure of membrane-reconstituted lacs was determined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy analysis. recent developments in the analysis of freeze-fracture images (eskandari, s. p., wright, e. m., freman, m., starace, d. m., and zampighi, g. a. (1998) proc. natl. acad. sci. u. s. a. 95, 11235-11240) allowed us to directly correlate the cross-sectional area of the transmembrane segment to a dimeric state of the functionally membrane-reconstituted lacs protein. the cross-sectional area of the lacs protein was calibrated using the membrane-reconstituted transmembrane domain of the mannitol transporter enzyme ii, an intramembrane particle for which the cross-sectional area was obtained from maps of two-dimensional crystals. the consequences of the determined quaternary structure for the transport function and regulation of lacs are discussed.

TI  == rotational mobility and orientational stability of a transport protein in lipid membranes.
AB  == a single-cysteine mutant of the lactose transport protein lacs(c320a/w399c) from  streptococcus thermophilus was selectively labeled with a nitroxide spin label, and its mobility in lipid membranes was studied as a function of its concentration in the membrane by saturation-transfer electron spin resonance. bovine rhodopsin was also selectively spin-labeled and studied to aid the interpretation of the measurements. observations of spin-labeled proteins in macroscopically aligned bilayers indicated that the spin label tends to orient so as to reflect the transmembrane orientation of the protein. rotational correlation times of 1-2 micros for purified spin-labeled bovine rhodopsin in lipid membranes led to viscosities of 2.2 poise for bilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (28 degrees c) and 3.0 poise for the specific mixture of lipids used to reconstitute lacs (30 degrees c). the rotational correlation time for lacs did not vary significantly over the range of low concentrations in lipid bilayers, where optimal activity was seen to decrease sharply and was determined to be 9 +/- 1 micros (mean +/- sd) for these samples.  this mobility was interpreted as being too low for a monomer but could correspond to a dimer if the protein self-associates into an elongated configuration within  the membrane. rather than changing its oligomeric state, lacs appeared to become  less ordered at the concentrations in aligned membranes exceeding 1:100 (w/w) with respect to the lipid.

AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is used extensively for industrial fermentation of dairy products. some strains of s. thermophilus are known to carry plasmids, and  many of these plasmids are suspected of encoding low-molecular-weight heat stress proteins (hsps) that may aid in survival under stressful conditions. in order to  confirm the presence and examine the similarity of these low-molecular-weight hsps, genes were identified and sequenced encoding hsps on plasmids per16 (4.5 kb), per35 (10 kb), and per36 (3.7 kb) from three different strains of s. thermophilus. the plasmid replication proteins were also sequenced to examine their relatedness. amino acid sequence comparisons of the hsps and of the replication proteins revealed a high degree of identity suggesting a common origin. heat stress proteins enhance the viability of bacteria in extreme environments, and the presence of an hsp encoded on a plasmid may enhance survival of s. thermophilus under harsh production conditions.

TI  == hpr(his approximately p)-mediated phosphorylation differently affects counterflow and proton motive force-driven uptake via the lactose transport protein of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the lactose transport protein (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus has a c-terminal hydrophilic domain that is homologous to iia protein and protein domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (pts).  the iia domain of lacs is phosphorylated on his-552 by the general energy coupling proteins of the pts, which are enzyme i and hpr. to study the effect of  phosphorylation on transport, the lacs protein was purified and incorporated into liposomes with the iia domain facing outwards. this allowed the phosphorylation of the membrane-reconstituted protein by purified hpr(his approximately p) of s.  thermophilus. phosphorylation of lacs increased the v(max) of counterflow transport, whereas the v(max) of the proton motive force (delta p)-driven lactose uptake was not affected. in line with a range of kinetic studies, we propose that phosphorylation affects the rate constants for the reorientation of the ternary complex (lacs with bound lactose plus proton), which is rate-determining for counterflow but not for delta p-driven transport.

TI  == phosphorylation state of hpr determines the level of expression and the extent of phosphorylation of the lactose transport protein of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the lactose transport protein (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus is composed of a translocator domain and a regulatory domain that is phosphorylated by hpr(his approximately p), the general energy coupling protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (pts). lactose transport is affected by the phosphorylation state of hpr through changes in the  activity of the lacs protein as well as expression of the lacs gene. to address whether or not ccpa-hpr(ser-p)-mediated catabolite control is involved, the levels of lacs were determined under conditions in which the cellular phosphorylation state of hpr greatly differed. it appears that hpr(ser-p) is mainly present in the exponential phase of growth, whereas hpr(his approximately  p) dominates in the stationary phase. the transition from hpr(ser-p) to hpr(his approximately p) parallels an increase in lacs level, a drop in lactose and an increase in galactose concentration in the growth medium. because the k(m)(out) for lactose is higher than that for galactose, the lactose transport capacity decreases as lactose concentration decreases and galactose accumulates in the medium. our data indicate that s. thermophilus compensates for the diminished transport capacity by synthesizing more lacs and phosphorylating the protein, which results in increased transport activity. the link between transport capacity and lacs expression levels and lacs phosphorylation are discussed.

TI  == autolysis and related proteolysis in swiss cheese for two lactobacillus helveticus strains.
AB  == intracellular peptidases of lactobacillus helveticus may play a major role in the proteolysis of swiss cheeses, provided that they are released through bacterial lysis. experimental swiss cheeses were manufactured on a small scale from thermized and microfiltered milk using as starters (in addition to streptococcus  thermophilus and propionibacterium freudenreichii) one of two lb. helveticus strains, itglh1 and itglh77, which undergo lysis to different extents in vitro. all the cheeses were biochemically identical after pressing. the viability of lb. helveticus itglh1 and itglh77 decreased to a similar extent (96-98%) while in the cold room, but the concomitant release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase in  cheeses made with strain itglh1 was 5-7-fold that in cheeses made with itglh77. protein profiles and immunoblot detection of the dipeptidase pepd confirmed a greater degree of lysis of the itglh1 strain. free active peptidases were detected in aqueous extracts of cheese for both strains, and proteolysis occurred principally in the warm room. reversed-phase hplc revealed a more extensive peptide hydrolysis for itglh1, which was confirmed by the greater release of free nh2 groups (+33%) and free amino acids (+75%) compared with itglh77. as the intracellular peptidase activities of itglh1 and itglh77 have previously been shown to be similar, our results indicated that the extent of lysis of lb. helveticus could have a direct impact on the degree of proteolysis in swiss cheeses.

TI  == dynamic changes of intracellular ph in individual lactic acid bacterium cells in  response to a rapid drop in extracellular ph.
AB  == we describe the dynamics of changes in the intracellular ph (ph(i)) values of a number of lactic acid bacteria in response to a rapid drop in the extracellular ph (ph(ex)). strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactococcus lactis were investigated. listeria innocua, a gram-positive, non-lactic acid bacterium, was included for comparison. the method which we used was based on fluorescence ratio imaging of single cells, and it was therefore possible to describe variations in ph(i) within a population. the bacteria were immobilized on a membrane filter, placed in a closed perfusion chamber, and analyzed during a rapid decrease in the ph(ex) from 7.0 to 5.0. under these conditions, the ph(i) of l. innocua remained neutral (between 7 and 8). in contrast, the ph(i) values of all of the strains of lactic  acid bacteria investigated decreased to approximately 5.5 as the ph(ex) was decreased. no pronounced differences were observed between cells of the same strain harvested from the exponential and stationary phases. small differences between species were observed with regard to the initial ph(i) at ph(ex) 7.0, while different kinetics of ph(i) regulation were observed in different species and also in different strains of s. thermophilus.

TI  == mur1, a streptococcus thermophilus peptidoglycan hydrolase devoid of a specific cell wall binding domain.
AB  == the gene encoding mur1, a streptococcus thermophilus peptidoglycan hydrolase, was cloned by homology with acma, the lactococcus lactis major autolysin gene. mur1 is a 24.7-kda protein endowed with a putative signal peptide. sequence analysis evidenced that mur1 encompasses exactly the acma region containing the catalytic  domain, but lacks the one containing amino acid repeats involved in cell wall binding. mur1 appears to be expressed and cell-associated in s. thermophilus, as  revealed by immunoblot analysis. these results suggest that the cell wall attachment mode of mur1 differs from that of most peptidoglycan hydrolases described so far.

TI  == effects of a muramidase on a mixed bacterial community.
AB  == in bacterial communities one bacterium can influence the growth of other members  of the population. these interactions may be based on nutritional factors or may  occur via bacterial signaling molecules that are released in the medium. we present an example, showing that in addition to the above means of interactions,  muramidases, enzymes that specifically cleave peptidoglycan chains, can also mediate interactions between bacteria. using fluorescent in situ hybridization we demonstrate that lactococcus lactis muramidase acma can hydrolyze the cell wall of streptococcus thermophilus, without affecting viability. this intercellular activity of the lactococcal muramidase results in chain disruption of streptococci in vivo. our data lead us to propose that chains can give growth advantages to streptococci in aerobic conditions.

TI  == use of chemical mutagenesis for the isolation of food grade beta-galactosidase overproducing mutants of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == a classical chemical mutagenesis protocol was evaluated for increasing beta-galactosidase production by probiotic bacteria to improve their potential to treat symptoms of lactose malabsorption in humans. two bifidobacterium species (b. breve and b. longum) and one strain each of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus were tested by a single exposure to two chemical mutagens, ethyl methanesulfonate (ems) and n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng). to screen for beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) overproducing mutants, optimized ems and mnng mutant pots for each strain were plated on bhi agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (x-gal). colonies that exhibited a blue color were selected for quantitative beta-gal activities using the o-nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside (onpg) assay. seventy-five mutants were obtained out of more than 2 million colonies screened and showed increased beta-galactosidase activities compared with the wild-type strains. ems gave a higher frequency of beta-gal overproducing mutants than mnng for three of the four strains, s. thermophilus, b. breve, and b. longum, whereas the frequency of  l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus beta-gal mutants was similar with both mutagens. the highest beta-gal increases, when induced during growth in lactose, for mutants of each culture were 137% for l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus; 104% for s. thermophilus; 70% for b. breve; and 222% for b. longum mutants. this food-grade classical approach has the ability to moderately increase beta-gal concentrations in probiotic cultures to improve their potential for treating the symptoms of lactose malabsorption in humans.

TI  == origin of acetaldehyde during milk fermentation using (13)c-labeled precursors.
AB  == acetaldehyde formation by lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus during fermentation of cow's milk was investigated using (13)c-labeled glucose, l-threonine, and pyruvate with a recent static-and-trapped-headspace technique that does not require derivatization of acetaldehyde prior to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. over 90% and almost 100% of acetaldehyde originated from glucose during fermentation by l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, respectively, taking into account both singly and doubly labeled acetaldehyde. as both microorganisms showed threonine aldolase activity and formed labeled acetaldehyde from (13)c-labeled threonine during the fermentation of milk, this amino acid should also contribute to the acetaldehyde produced.

TI  == close approximation of putative alpha -helices ii, iv, vii, x, and xi in the translocation pathway of the lactose transport protein of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the lactose transport protein (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a family of transporters in which putative alpha-helices ii and iv have been implicated in cation binding and the coupled transport of the substrate and the cation. here, the analysis of site-directed mutants shows that a positive and negative charge at positions 64 and 71 in helix ii are essential for transport, but not for lactose binding. the conservation of charge/side-chain properties is  less critical for glu-67 and ile-70 in helix ii, and asp-133 and lys-139 in helix iv, but these residues are important for the coupled transport of lactose together with a proton. the analysis of second-site suppressor mutants indicates  an ion pair exists between helices ii and iv, and thus a close approximation of these helices can be made. the second-site suppressor analysis also suggests ion  pairing between helix ii and the intracellular loops 6-7 and 10-11. because the c-terminal region of the transmembrane domain, especially helix xi and loop 10-11, is important for substrate binding in this family of proteins, we propose  that sugar and proton binding and translocation are performed by the joint action of these regions in the protein. indeed, substrate protection of maleimide labeling of single cysteine mutants confirms that alpha-helices ii and iv are directly interacting or at least conformationally involved in sugar binding and/or translocation. on the basis of new and published data, we reason that the  helices ii, iv, vii, x, and xi and the intracellular loops 6-7 and 10-11 are in close proximity and form the binding sites and/or the translocation pathway in the transporters of the galactosides-pentosides-hexuronides family.

TI  == probiotic culture survival and implications in fermented frozen yogurt characteristics.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus thermophilus strains that undergo lysis under unfavourable environmental conditions.
AB  == the autolysis of starter lactic acid bacteria appears as a promising way to enhance the flavour of fermented dairy products. the present work was aimed at investigating the autolysis phenomenon in streptococcus thermophilus, a thermophilic lactic acid bacteria involved in the starters used for the production of yoghurts, italian and swiss-type cheeses. out of 146 strains screened for their aptitude to spontaneously lyse at the end of growth in m17 medium containing lactose in limited concentration, six strains, among which is the type strain cnrz 1358, were found to be highly autolytic. these autolytic strains are characterized by a typical bell-shaped growth curve. lysis of the type strain, which was studied as the model, was triggered under unfavourable environmental conditions, such as lactose depletion and nacl or organic solvents  addition. the lysogenic character of this strain was evidenced. taken together, our results indicate that the autolytic phenotype in s. thermophilus is linked to the lysogenic character but does not result from the massive prophage induction under stressing conditions.

TI  == thermal and chemical inactivation of indigenous streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages isolated from argentinian dairy plants.
AB  == thermal and chemical resistance of five autochthonal bacteriophages of streptococcus thermophilus, isolated from cuartirolo cheese wheys and yogurt, was investigated. times to obtain 99% inactivation of phages (t99) at 63 degrees c and 72 degrees c in three suspension media (enriched tryptic soy broth, reconstituted commercial nonfat skim milk, and tris magnesium gelatin buffer) were determined. the thermal resistance was dependent on the phages studied but not detectable counts (<10 pfu/ml) were only achieved by heating at 90 degrees c  during 5 min. the data obtained for the three assayed media did not permit verifying significant differences among them. sodium hypochlorite (100 ppm) provided a fast inactivation of bacteriophage particles (<10 pfu/ml after 5 min). ethanol, at concentrations of 75% and 100%, was also effective for phage destruction. isopropanol was slightly less effective than ethanol at the same concentrations. peracetic acid (0.15%) was also a very effective agent for phage  inactivation. the results showed that these autochthonal bacteriophages were not  completely inactivated neither by normal pasteurization treatments nor by some biocides commonly used in disinfection, except sodium hypochlorite and peracetic  acid. the practical implications of these findings have pointed out the necessity of recognizing the importance of establishing adequate conditions to assure effective thermal and chemical treatments in dairy plants and laboratory environments.

TI  == reference map of soluble proteins from streptococcus thermophilus by two-dimensional electrophoresis.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium widely used for the production of fermented dairy products. the two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-de) protein profile was obtained from three independent analyses of 2-de gels  of soluble proteins of the strain pb18. about 270 spots were detected by silver staining and the average molecular weight and isoelectric point of each protein spot were calculated to be 41 600 and 5.2, respectively. twelve proteins were purified by chromatographic techniques because their concentration was too low for direct sequencing from blots. eleven were located in the pb18 2-de profile after silver staining. these preliminary results contribute to the setting up of  a two-dimensional image (or reference map) of the proteins from s. thermophilus in order to identify and compare strains of various origin or to follow metabolic process such as stress. bidimensional autoradiographs of two strains (pb18 and st105) of s. thermophilus grown in exponential phase at 42 degrees c with [35s]methionine were compared with an image analysis system. among the eleven located proteins in the 2-de silver-stained profile, nine were found in pb18 and  eight in st105 autoradiographs. one protein was specific to pb18. the eight proteins could play the role of internal 2-d page markers of p/ and mr for s. thermophilus.

AB  == probiotic bacteria strains were examined for their influence on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced intestinal tumors in 100 male sprague-dawley  rats. lactobacillus acidophilus (delvo pro la-1), lactobacillus rhamnosus (gg), bifidobacterium animalis (cscc1941), and streptococcus thermophilus (dd145) strains were examined for their influence when added as freeze-dried bacteria to  an experimental diet based on a high-fat semipurified (ain-93) rodent diet. four  bacterial treatments were compared: l. acidophilus, l. acidophilus + b. animalis, l. rhamnosus, and s. thermophilus, the bacteria being added daily at 1% freeze-dried weight (10(10) colony-forming units/g) to the diet. trends were observed in the incidence of rats with large intestinal tumors for three treatments: 25% lower than control for l. acidophilus, 20% lower for l. acidophilus + b. animalis and l. rhamnosus treatments, and 10% lower for s. thermophilus. large intestinal tumor burden was significantly lower for treated rats with l. acidophilus than for the control group (10 and 3 tumors/treatment group, respectively, p = 0.05). large intestinal tumor mass index was also lower  for the l. acidophilus treatment than for control (1.70 and 0.10, respectively, p < 0.05). other treatments showed no statistically significant change from control for these indexes of tumorigenesis. for rats fed l. acidophilus, no adenocarcinomas were present in the colons. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial chromosomal dna fragments was used to differentiate introduced (exogenous) bacterial strains from indigenous bacteria of the same genera present in the feces. survival during gut passage and displacement of indigenous lactobacilli occurred with introduced l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus gg during the probiotic treatment period. however, introduced strains of b. animalis and s. thermophilus were not able to be isolated from feces. it is concluded that this strain of l. acidophilus supplied as freeze-dried bacteria in the diet was protective, as seen by a small but significant inhibition of tumors within the rat colon.

TI  == the streptococcus thermophilus autolytic phenotype results from a leaky prophage.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus autolytic strains are characterized by a typical bell-shaped growth curve when grown under appropriate conditions. the cellular mechanisms involved in the triggering of lysis and the bacteriolytic activities of these strains were investigated in this study. lactose depletion and organic solvents (ethanol, methanol, and chloroform) were shown to trigger a premature and immediate lysis of m17 exponentially growing cells. these factors and compounds are suspected to act by altering the cell envelope properties, causing  either the permeabilization (organic solvents) or the depolarization (lactose depletion) of the cytoplasmic membrane. the autolytic character was shown to be associated with lysogeny. phage particles, most of which were defective, were observed in the culture supernatants after both mitomycin c-induced and spontaneous lysis. by renaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a bacteriolytic activity was detected at 31 kda exclusively in the autolytic strains. this enzyme was detected during both growth and spontaneous lysis with the same intensity. we have shown that it was prophage encoded and homologous to the endolysin lyt51 of the streptococcal temperate bacteriophage phi01205 (m. sheehan, e. stanley, g. f. fitzgerald, and d. van sinderen, appl. environ. microbiol. 65:569-577, 1999). it appears from our results that the autolytic properties are conferred to the s. thermophilus strains by a leaky prophage but do not result from massive prophage induction. more specifically, we propose that phagic genes are constitutively expressed in almost all the cells at a low and nonlethal level and that lysis is controlled and achieved by the prophage-encoded lysis proteins.

TI  == modulating immune responses with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == for many years, probiotic bacteria have been known to confer health benefits to the consumer. one possible mechanism for this may be the ability of probiotic bacteria to modulate immune responses. oral administration of lactobacillus casei strain shirota (lcs) has been found to enhance innate immunity by stimulating the activity of splenic nk cells. oral feeding with killed lcs was able to stimulate  the production of th1 cytokines, resulting in repressed production of ige antibodies against ovalbumin in experimental mice. the ability to switch mucosal  immune responses towards th1 with probiotic bacteria provides a strategy for treatment of allergic disorders. growth of meth a tumour cells in the lungs was also inhibited by intrapleural injection of lcs. oral administration of other probiotic bacteria, such as streptococcus thermophilus (st), lactobacillus fermentum (lf) and yeast (y), elicited different immune responses. mice that were prefed yeast or lf followed by feeding with ovalbumin (ova) responded better to vaccination with ova than mice not given either probiotic or ova or mice that had been prefed only ova. however, antibody responses were significantly suppressed in response to vaccination with ova in mice that had been prefed yeast followed by yeast and ova as well as mice prefed lf followed by lf and ova. prefeeding st  followed by ova feeding enhanced cellular immune responses against ovalbumin. in  contrast, mice prefed st followed by st + ova were hyporesponsive against ova. while antigen feeding alone appears to prime for an immune response, cofeeding antigen with probiotic bacteria can suppress both antibody and cellular immune responses and may provide an efficacious protocol to attenuate autoimmune diseases, such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, by jointly dosing with myelin basic protein and probiotic bacteria.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria for bile salt hydrolase activity.
AB  == bile salt hydrolysis is an important metabolic reaction in the bile salt metabolism of mammals. this reaction has a facilitating effect for bile salt excretion but can also be involved in various illnesses. in recent years interest has increased to use bile salt hydrolysis to influence the cholesterol metabolism of humans and farm animals. to understand the distribution and range of bile salt hydrolase activity in lactic acid bacteria, we screened more than 300 strains of  the genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus and the species lactococcus lactis,  leuconostoc mesenteroides, and streptococcus thermophilus. results obtained for 273 strains showed that bile salt hydrolase activity is common in bifidobacterium and lactobacillus but absent in l. lactis, leu. mesenteroides, and s. thermophilus. nearly all bifidobacteria species and strains have bile salt hydrolase activity, whereas this activity can only be found in selected species of lactobacilli. a strong correlation can be observed between the habitat of a genus or species and the presence of bile salt hydrolase activity. most often bile salt hydrolase activity is found in strains that have been isolated from the intestines or from feces from mammals--an environment rich in conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. strains and species from other habitats like milk or vegetables--environments from which bile salts are absent--do normally not have bile salt hydrolase activity. in two independent assays, we established that bile salt hydrolase activity in bifidobacteria is, in general, much higher than in lactobacilli.

TI  == the effect of a probiotic milk product on plasma cholesterol: a meta-analysis of  short-term intervention studies.
AB  == introduction: certain fermented dairy milk products may have beneficial effects on plasma cholesterol levels. however, a number of studies have produced conflicting results as to whether dietary supplementation by a probiotic dairy product containing the bacteria culture causido(r) reduces plasma cholesterol. objective: to conduct a meta-analysis of intervention studies to evaluate the effect of the causido(r) culture on plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-cholesterol. the probiotic milk product: the yoghurt product gaio(r) is fermented with causido(r), composed of one strain of enterococcus faecium (human species) with the proposed cholesterol-lowering effect, and two strains of streptococcus thermophilus. study inclusion and data extraction: six studies were identified from a literature search and from the yoghurt producer. all studies met the inclusion criteria. summary data for plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol were extracted from the original publications or by personal request to the authors. data from 4-8 weeks of treatment duration was used. statistical analysis: we performed a traditional meta-analysis where mean differences between intervention and control of the pre-post changes in total cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol were calculated, as well as 95% confidence intervals (cis). results: in the six studies included in the meta-analysis, the gaio(r) interventions produced changes in total cholesterol above those of the control groups ranging from -0.02 to -1.02 mmol/l  and in ldl-cholesterol ranging from -0.02 to -1.15 mmol/l. after inclusion of an  open-label study, the meta-analysis of the double-blind studies showed that gaio(r) as compared to the control group changed total cholesterol by -0.22 mmol/l (95% ci: -0.35 to -0.08, p<0.01) and ldl-cholesterol by -0.20 mmol/l (95%  ci: -0.33 to -0.06, p<0.005). the outcome was essentially the same if all studies were included. conclusions: the present meta-analysis of controlled short-term intervention studies shows that the fermented yoghurt product produced a 4% decrease in total cholesterol and a 5% decrease in ldl-cholesterol when the open-label study is excluded. to demonstrate sustained effects on blood lipids, long-term studies are required. sponsorship: md foods a/s, denmark.

TI  == widespread distribution of a group i intron and its three deletion derivatives in the lysin gene of streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages.
AB  == of 62 streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages isolated from various ecological  settings, half contain a lysin gene interrupted by a group ia2 intron. phage mrna splicing was demonstrated. five phages possess a variant form of the intron resulting from three distinct deletion events located in the intron-harbored open reading frame (orf 253). the predicted orf 253 gene sequence showed a significantly lower gc content than the surrounding intron and lysin gene sequences, and the predicted protein shared a motif with endonucleases found in phages from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. a comparison of the phage lysin genes revealed a clear division between intron-containing and intron-free alleles, leading to the establishment of a 14-bp consensus sequence associated with intron possession. the conserved intron was not found elsewhere in the phage or s. thermophilus bacterial genomes. folding of the intron rna revealed secondary structure elements shared with other phage introns: first, a 38-bp insertion between regions p3 and p4 that can be folded into two stem-loop structures (shared with introns from bacillus phage spo1 and relatives); second,  a conserved p7.2 region (shared with all phage introns); third, the location of the stop codon from orf 253 in the p8 stem (shared with coliphage t4 and bacillus phage spo1 introns); fourth, orf 253, which has sequence similarity with the h-n-h motif of putative endonuclease genes found in introns from lactococcus, lactobacillus, and bacillus phages.

TI  == a spectroscopic assay for the analysis of carbohydrate transport reactions.
AB  == a carbohydrate-transport assay was developed that does not require isotopically labelled substrates, but allows transport reactions to be followed spectrophotometrically. it makes use of a membrane system (hybrid membranes or proteoliposomes) bearing the transport system of interest, and a pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent aldose dehydrogenase [soluble glucose dehydrogenase (sgdh)] and the electron acceptor 2,6-dichloroindophenol (cl2ind) enclosed in the vesicle lumen. after transport across the vesicular membrane, the sugar is oxidized by sgdh. the accompanying reduction of cl2ind results in a decrease in a600. the assay was developed and optimized for the lactose carrier (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus, and both solute/h+ symport and exchange types of transport could be measured with high sensitivity in crude membranes as well as in proteoliposomes.  to observe exchange transport, the membranes were preloaded with a nonoxidizable  substrate analogue and diluted in assay buffer containing an oxidizable sugar. transport rates measured with this assay are comparable with those obtained with  the conventional assay using isotopically labelled substrates. the method is particularly suited for determining transport reactions that are not coupled to any form of metabolic energy such as uniport reactions, or for characterizing mutant proteins with a defective energy-coupling mechanism or systems with high-affinity constants for sugars.

TI  == proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and  streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined  in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the  results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and  no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) mass spectrometry was employed to determine the changes in milk protein profile due to the action of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, the strains usually employed in yogurt production. whereas the fermentation with the  former shows the digestion of high molecular mass casein with the production of a low molecular mass peptide (3850 da), the latter does not seem to exhibit any proteolytic activity. proteolysis becomes relevant when milk is treated with a mixture of the two bacteria, reasonably due to symbiotic phenomena. the analysis  of yogurt samples coming from industrial plants indicates increased activity of the two bacteria in the presence of ingredients containing sugars. copyright 1999 john wiley & sons, ltd.

TI  == substrate recognition at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of the lactose transport protein of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the lactose transport protein (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus catalyzes the  uptake of lactose in an exchange reaction with intracellularly formed galactose.  the interactions between the substrate and the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of lacs have been characterized by assaying binding and transport of a range of sugars in proteoliposomes, in which the purified protein was reconstituted with a unidirectional orientation. specificity for galactoside binding is given by the spatial configuration of the c-2, c-3, c-4, and c-6 hydroxyl groups of the galactose moiety. except for a c-4 methoxy substitution, replacement of the hydroxyl groups for bulkier groups is not tolerated at these positions. large hydrophobic or hydrophilic substitutions on the galactose c-1 alpha or beta position did not impair transport. in fact, the hydrophobic groups  increased the binding affinity but decreased transport rates compared with galactose. binding and transport characteristics of deoxygalactosides from either side of the membrane showed that the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site interact differently with galactose. compared with galactose, the ic(50) values for 2-deoxy- and 6-deoxygalactose at the cytoplasmic binding site were increased  150- and 20-fold, respectively, whereas they were the same at the extracellular binding site. from these and other experiments, we conclude that the binding sites and translocation pathway of lacs are spacious along the c-1 to c-4 axis of the galactose moiety and are restricted along the c-2 to c-6 axis. the differences in affinity at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site ensure  that the transport via lacs is highly asymmetrical for the two opposing directions of translocation.

TI  == unraveling the function of glycosyltransferases in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus sfi6 produces a texturizing exopolysaccharide (eps) consisting of a -->3)[alpha-d-galp-(1-->6)]-beta-d-glcp-(1-->3)-alpha-d-galpnac-(1--> 3)-beta-d-galp-(1--> repeating unit. we previously identified and analyzed a 14.5-kb gene cluster from s. thermophilus sfi6 consisting of 13 genes responsible for its eps production. within this gene cluster, we found a central region of genes (epse, epsf, epsg, and epsi) that showed similarity to glycosyltransferases. in this study, we investigated the sugar specificity of these enzymes. epse catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of the eps repeating unit. it exhibits phosphogalactosyltransferase activity and transfers galactose onto the lipophilic carrier. the second step is fulfilled by epsg, which transfers an alpha-n-acetylgalactosamine onto the first beta-galactoside. the activity of epsf was determined by characterizing the eps produced by an s. thermophilus epsf deletion mutant. this eps consisted of the monosaccharides gal, glc, and galnac in an approximately equimolar ratio, thus suggesting that epsf codes for the branching galactosyltransferase. epsi probably codes for the beta-1,3-glucosyltransferase, since it is the only glycosyltransferase to which no gene has been assigned and it exhibits similarity to other beta-glycosyltransferases. epse shows the conserved features of phosphoglycosyltransferases, whereas epsf and epsg exhibit the primary structure  of alpha-glycosyltransferases, belonging to glycosyltransferase family 4, whose members are conserved in all major phylogenetic lineages, including the archaea and eukaryota.

AB  == sixteen exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing lactococcus lactis strains were analyzed for the chemical compositions of their epss and the locations, sequences, and organization of the eps genes involved in eps biosynthesis. this allowed the grouping of these strains into three major groups, representatives of which were studied in detail. previously, we have characterized the eps gene cluster of strain nizo b40 (group i) and determined the function of three of its  glycosyltransferase (gtf) genes. fragments of the eps gene clusters of strains nizo b35 (group ii) and nizo b891 (group iii) were cloned, and these encoded the  nizo b35 priming galactosyltransferase, the nizo b891 priming glucosyltransferase, and the nizo b891 galactosyltransferase involved in the second step of repeating-unit synthesis. the nizo b40 priming glucosyltransferase gene epsd was replaced with an erythromycin resistance gene, and this resulted in loss of eps production. this epsd deletion was complemented with priming gtf genes from gram-positive organisms with known function and substrate specificity. although no eps production was found with priming galactosyltransferase genes from l. lactis or streptococcus thermophilus, complementation with priming glucosyltransferase genes involved in l. lactis eps and streptococcus pneumoniae  capsule biosynthesis could completely restore or even increase eps production in  l. lactis.

AB  == a rapid (30-35 min) bioluminescence assay of total bacterial contamination (tbc)  of raw milk was optimized. this method includes incubation of milk samples in the presence of neonol-10 and medical purity grade pancreatin with further removal of nonbacterial atp by filtration through a membrane filter, cell disruption by treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide, and measurement of atp concentration in a reaction with the bioluminescent reagent immolum. the tbc detection threshold is  0.5 x 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu) per ml milk. coefficients of correlation between the standard plate count method and bioluminescence assay (r) and residual standard deviations (sxy) in raw milk samples (n = 140) were 0.83 and 0.54, respectively. in sterilized milk samples artificially contaminated with pure cultures of the main representatives of milk microflora (coli-forms, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus thermophilus, and streptococcus group d), these values were 0.89-0.99 and 0.09-0.29, respectively. the specific content of  atp was found to be (0.8 +/- 0.1) x 10(-18) mol/cfu in coli-forms; (12.0 +/- 8.1) x 10(-18) mol/cfu in s. aureus; (35.2 +/- 16.9) x 10(-18) mol/cfu in s. thermophilus; and (42.5 +/- 1.3) x 10(-18) in streptococcus group d.

TI  == cloning and expression of the pediocin operon in streptococcus thermophilus and other lactic fermentation bacteria.
AB  == production of pediocin in pediococcus acidilactici is associated with pmbr1.0, which encodes prepediocin, a pediocin immunity protein, and two proteins involved in secretion and precursor processing. these four genes are organized as an operon under control of a single promoter. we have constructed shuttle vectors that contain all four structural genes, the chromosomal promoter st(p2201) from streptococcus thermophilus, and repa from the 2-kbp s. thermophilus plasmid per8. the recombinant plasmid, ppc318, expressed and secreted active pediocin in escherichia coli. streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and enterococcus faecalis were electrotransformed with ppc418, a modified vector  fitted with an erythromycin resistance tracking gene. pediocin was produced and secreted in each of the lactic acid bacteria, and production was stable for up to ten passages. the expression of pediocin in dairy fermentation microbes has important implications for bacteriocins as food preservatives in dairy products.

TI  == comparative genomics of streptococcus thermophilus phage species supports a modular evolution theory.
AB  == the comparative analysis of five completely sequenced streptococcus thermophilus  bacteriophage genomes demonstrated that their diversification was achieved by a combination of dna recombination events and an accumulation of point mutations. the five phages included lytic and temperate phages, both pac site and cos site,  from three distinct geographical areas. the units of genetic exchange were either large, comprising the entire morphogenesis gene cluster, excluding the putative tail fiber genes, or small, consisting of one or maximally two genes or even segments of a gene. many indels were flanked by dna repeats. differences in a single putative tail fiber gene correlated with the host ranges of the phages. the predicted tail fiber protein consisted of highly conserved domains containing conspicuous glycine repeats interspersed with highly variable domains. as in the  t-even coliphage adhesins, the glycine-containing domains were recombinational hot spots. downstream of a highly conserved dna replication region, all lytic phages showed a short duplication; in three isolates the origin of replication was repeated. the lytic phages could conceivably be derived from the temperate phages by deletion and multiple rearrangement events in the lysogeny module, giving rise to occasional selfish phages that defy the superinfection control systems of the corresponding temperate phages.

AB  == the antioxidative activity of the intracellular extracts of yogurt organisms was  investigated. all 11 strains tested, including five strains of streptococcus thermophilus and six strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, demonstrated an antioxidative effect on the inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation. the antioxidative effect of intracellular extracts of 10(8) cells of yogurt organisms was equivalent to 25 to 96 ppm butylated hydroxytoluene, which indicated that all strains demonstrated excellent antioxidative activity. the scavenging of reactive oxygen species, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide was studied for intracellular extracts of yogurt organisms. all strains  showed reactive oxygen species-scavenging ability. lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb demonstrated the highest hydroxyl radical-scavenging ability at 234 microm. streptococcus thermophilus mc and 821 and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus  448 and 449 scavenged the most hydrogen peroxide at approximately 50 microm. the  scavenging ability of lipid peroxidation products, t-butylhydroperoxide and malondialdehyde, was also evaluated. results showed that the extracts were not able to scavenge the t-butylhydroperoxide. nevertheless, malondialdehyde was scavenged well by most strains.

TI  == impact on the composition of the faecal flora by a new probiotic preparation: preliminary data on maintenance treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis.
AB  == background: although 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-asa) oral compounds are the standard maintenance treatment for ulcerative colitis in remission, some patients cannot use them because of side-effects. clinical and experimental observations have suggested the potential role of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease therapy. aim: to evaluate the effects on intestinal microflora and the clinical efficacy of a new probiotic preparation in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. patients and methods: twenty patients with ulcerative colitis, intolerant or allergic to 5-asa, have been treated with a new probiotic preparation (vsl#3, csl, milan, italy) containing 5x10(11) cells/g of 3 strains of bifidobacteria, 4 strains of lactobacilli and 1 strain of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. two doses of 3 g were administered o.d. for 12 months. faecal samples for stool culture were obtained from the patients at the beginning of the trial and after 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, 90 days, 12 months and at 15 days after the end of the treatment. the following bacterial groups have been evaluated in the faeces: total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, enterococci, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms. patients were assessed clinically every two months, and assessed endoscopically at 6 and 12 months or in relapse. results: faecal concentrations of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased significantly in all patients, compared to their basal level, from the 20th day of treatment (p<0.05) and remained stable throughout the study. concentrations of bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms, total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly during treatment (p = n.s.). fifteen of 20 treated patients remained in remission during the study, one patient was lost to follow up, while the remaining relapsed. no significant side-effects have been reported. conclusions: these results show that this probiotic preparation is able to colonize the intestine, and suggest that it may  be useful in maintaining the remission in ulcerative colitis patients intolerant  or allergic to 5-asa. controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.

TI  == structural information on a membrane transport protein from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using sequence-selective nitroxide labeling.
AB  == the lactose transport protein (lacs) from streptococcus thermophilus bearing a single cysteine mutation, k373c, within the putative interhelix loop 10-11 has been overexpressed in native membranes. cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (nmr) could selectively distinguish binding of (13)c-labeled substrate to just 50-60 nmol of lacs(k373c) in the native fluid membranes. nitroxide electron spin-label at the k373c location was essentially immobile on the time scale of both conventional electron spin resonance spectroscopy (esr) (<10(-8)s) and saturation-transfer esr (<10(-3)s), under the same conditions as used in the nmr studies. the presence of the nitroxide spin-label effectively obscured the high-resolution nmr signal from bound substrate, even though (13)c-labeled substrate was shown to be within the binding center of the protein. the interhelix loop 10-11 is concluded to be in reasonably close proximity to the substrate binding site(s) of lacs (<15 a), and  the loop region is expected to penetrate between the transmembrane segments of the protein that are involved in the translocation process.

TI  == comparative sequence analysis of the dna packaging, head, and tail morphogenesis  modules in the temperate cos-site streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage sfi21.
AB  == the temperate streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage sfi21 possesses 15-nucleotide-long cohesive ends with a 3' overhang that reconstitutes a cos-site with twofold hyphenated rotational symmetry. over the dna packaging, head and tail morphogenesis modules, the sfi21 sequence predicts a gene map that is strikingly similar to that of lambdoid coliphages in the absence of any sequence  similarity. a nearly one to one gene correlation was found with the phage lambda  genes nu1 to h, except for gene b-to-e complex, where the sfi21 map resembled that of coliphage hk97. the similarity between sfi21 and hk97 was striking: both  major head proteins showed an n-terminal coiled-coil structure, the mature major  head proteins started at amino acid positions 105 and 104, respectively, and both major head genes were preceded by genes encoding a possible protease and portal protein. the purported sfi21 protease is the first viral member of the clpp protease family. the prediction of sfi21 gene functions by reference to the gene  map of intensively investigated coliphages was experimentally confirmed for the major head and tail gene. phage sfi21 shows nucleotide sequence similarity with lactococcus phage bk5-t and a lactococcal prophage and amino acid sequence similarity with the lactobacillus phage a2 and the staphylococcus phage pvl. pvl  is a missing link that connects the portal proteins from sfi21 and hk97 with respect to sequence similarity. these observations and database searches, which demonstrate sequence similarity between proteins of phage from gram-positive bacteria, proteobacteria, and archaea, constrain models of phage evolution.

TI  == the genetic relationship between virulent and temperate streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages: whole genome comparison of cos-site phages sfi19 and sfi21.
AB  == the virulent cos-site streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage sfi19 has a 37,392-bp-long genome consisting of 44 open reading frames all encoded on the same dna strand. the genome of the temperate cos-site s. thermophilus phage sfi21 is 3.3 kb longer (40,740 bp, 53 orfs). both genomes are very similarly organized  and differed mainly by gene deletion and dna rearrangement events in the lysogeny module; gene replacement, duplication, and deletion events in the dna replication module, and numerous point mutations. the level of point mutations varied from <1% (lysis and dna replication modules) to >15% (dna packaging and head morphogenesis modules). a dotplot analysis showed nearly a straight line over the left 25 kb of their genomes. over the right genome half, a more variable dotplot  pattern was observed. the entire lysogeny module from sfi21 comprising 12 genes was replaced by 7 orfs in sfi19, six showed similarity with genes from temperate  pac-site s. thermophilus phages. none of the genes implicated in the establishment of the lysogenic state (integrase, superinfection immunity, repressor) or remnants of it were conserved in sfi19, while a cro-like repressor  was detected. downstream of the highly conserved dna replication module 11 and 13 orfs were found in sfi19 and phisfi21, respectively: two orfs from sfi21 were replaced by a different gene and a duplication of the phage origin of replication in sfi19; a further orf was only found in sfi21. all other orfs from this region, which included a second putative phage repressor, were closely related between both phages. two noncoding regions of sfi19 showed sequence similarity to pst1, a small cryptic plasmid of s. thermophilus.

TI  == effect of the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus on ceramide levels in human keratinocytes in vitro and stratum corneum in vivo.
AB  == the effects of streptococcus thermophilus on ceramide levels either in vitro on cultured human keratinocytes or in vivo on stratum corneum, have been investigated. in vitro, streptococcus thermophilus enhanced the levels of ceramides in keratinocytes in a time-dependent way. the presence of high levels of neutral, glutathione-sensitive, sphingomyelinase in streptococcus thermophilus could be responsible for the observed ceramide increase. the application of a base cream containing sonicated streptococcus thermophilus in the forearm skin of 17 healthy volunteers for 7 d also led to a significant and relevant increase of  skin ceramide amounts, which could be due to the sphingomyelin hydrolysis through bacterial neutral sphingomyelinase. indeed, similar results were obtained with a  base cream containing purified bacterial neutral sphingomyelinase. in addition, the inhibition of bacterial neutral sphingomyelinase activity through glutathione blocked the skin ceramide increase observed after the treatment. the topical application of a sonicated streptococcus thermophilus preparation, leading to increased stratum corneum ceramide levels, could thus result in the improvement of lipid barrier and a more effective resistance against xerosis.

TI  == peps from streptococcus thermophilus. a new member of the aminopeptidase t family of thermophilic bacteria.
AB  == the proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria is essential for bacterial growth  in milk but also for the development of the organoleptic properties of dairy products. streptococcus thermophilus is widely used in the dairy industry. in comparison with the model lactic acid bacteria lactococcus lactis, s. thermophilus possesses two additional peptidases (an oligopeptidase and the aminopeptidase peps). to understand how s. thermophilus grows in milk, we purified and characterized this aminopeptidase. peps is a monomeric metallopeptidase of approximately 45 kda with optimal activity in the range ph 7.5-8.5 and at 55 degrees c on arg-paranitroanilide as substrate. peps exhibits a high specificity towards peptides possessing arginine or aromatic amino acids at  the n-terminus. from the n-terminal protein sequence of peps, we deduced degenerate oligonucleotides and amplified the corresponding gene by successive pcr reactions. the deduced amino-acid sequence of the peps gene has high identity (40-50%) with the aminopeptidase t family from thermophilic and extremophilic bacteria; we thus propose the classification of peps from s. thermophilus as a new member of this family. in view of its substrate specificity, peps could be involved both in bacterial growth by supplying amino acids, and in the development of dairy products' flavour, by hydrolysing bitter peptides and liberating aromatic amino acids which are important precursors of aroma compounds.

TI  == indication that the nitrogen source influences both amount and size of exopolysaccharides produced by streptococcus thermophilus ly03 and modelling of the bacterial growth and exopolysaccharide production in a complex medium
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus ly03 is a yogurt strain producing the same exopolysaccharide material in both milk and mrs broth. actually, two types of exopolysaccharides are produced simultaneously. the two exopolysaccharides are identical in monomer composition (galactose and glucose in a 4:1 ratio) but differ in molecular size. gel permeation chromatography revealed a high-molecular-mass exopolysaccharide (1.8 x 10(6)) and a low-molecular-mass exopolysaccharide (4.1 x 10(5)). both exopolysaccharides can be isolated from the fermentation broth separately. the proportion in which they are produced is strongly dependent on the carbon/nitrogen ratio of the fermentation broth. a shift from a high-molecular-mass exopolysaccharide to a low-molecular-mass exopolysaccharide was observed with increasing initial complex nitrogen concentrations. all necessary biokinetic parameters to study the kinetics of s. thermophilus ly03 fermentations were obtained from a mathematical model which describes both s. thermophilus ly03 growth and exopolysaccharide production and degradation. the model is valid with various initial complex nitrogen concentrations and can be applied to simulate exopolysaccharide production in a milk medium.

AB  == the general aminopeptidase pepn from streptococcus thermophilus a was purified to protein homogeneity by hydroxyapatite, anion-exchange, and gel filtration chromatographies. the pepn enzyme was estimated to be a monomer of 95 kda, with maximal activity on n-lys-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin at ph 7 and 37 degrees c. it was strongly inhibited by metal chelating agents, suggesting that it is a metallopeptidase. the activity was greatly restored by the bivalent cations co2+, zn2+, and mn2+. except for proline, glycine, and acidic amino acid residues, pepn has a broad specificity on the n-terminal amino acid of small peptides, but no significant endopeptidase activity has been detected. the n-terminal and short internal amino acid sequences of purified pepn were determined. by using synthetic primers and a battery of pcr techniques, the pepn gene was amplified, subcloned, and further sequenced, revealing an open reading frame of 2,541 nucleotides encoding a protein of 847 amino acids with a molecular weight of 96,252. amino acid sequence analysis of the pepn gene translation product shows high homology with other pepn enzymes from lactic acid bacteria and exhibits the  signature sequence of the zinc metallopeptidase family. the pepn gene was cloned  in a t7 promoter-based expression plasmid and the 452-fold overproduced pepn enzyme was purified to homogeneity from the periplasmic extract of the host escherichia coli strain. the overproduced enzyme showed the same catalytic characteristics as the wild-type enzyme.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == introduction of the exopolysaccharide gene cluster from streptococcus thermophilus sfi6 into lactococcus lactis mg1363: production and characterization of an altered polysaccharide.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus sfi6 produces an exopolysaccharide (eps) composed of glucose, galactose and n-acetylgalactosamine in the molar ratio of 1:2:1. the genes responsible for the eps biosynthesis have been isolated previously and found to be clustered in a 14.5 kb region encoding 13 genes. transfer of this gene cluster into a non-eps-producing heterologous host, lactococcus lactis mg1363, yielded an eps with a similar high molecular weight, but a different structure from the eps from the native host. the structure of the recombinant eps was determined by means of 1h homonuclear and 1h-13c heteronuclear two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectra and was found to be -->  3)-beta-d-glcp-(1 --> 3)-alpha-d-galp-(1 --> 3)-beta-d-galp-(1 --> as opposed to  --> 3)[alpha-d-galp-(1 --> 6)]-beta-d-glcp-(1 --> 3)-alpha-d-galpnac-(1 --> 3)-beta-d-galp-(1 --> for the wild-type s. thermophilus sfi6. furthermore, l. lactis mg1363 (pfs101) was also lacking a udp-n-acetylglucosamine c4-epimerase activity, which would provide udp-galnac for a galnac incorporation into the eps  and probably caused the substitution of galnac by gal in the recombinant eps. this modification implies that (i) bacterial glycosyltransferases could potentially have multiple specificities for the donor and the acceptor sugar molecule; and (ii) the repeating unit polymerase can recognize and polymerize a repeating unit that differs in the backbone as well as in the side-chain from its native substrate.

TI  == are horizontal transfers involved in the evolution of the streptococcus thermophilus exopolysaccharide synthesis loci?
AB  == a 32.5kb variable locus of the streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 chromosome, the eps locus, contains 25 orf and seven insertion sequences (is). the putative products of 17 orf are related to proteins involved in the synthesis of polysaccharides in various bacteria. the two distal regions and a small central region of the eps locus are constant and present in all or almost all of the s. thermophilus strains tested. the other regions are variable and present in only some s. thermophilus strains tested, particularly in the closely related strains  cnrz368 and a054. a 13.6kb variable region of the eps locus of s. thermophilus cnrz368 contains two orf that are almost identical to epsl and orfy of the eps locus of lactococcus lactis nizob40 and seven is belonging to four different families, iss1, is981, is1193 and is1194. five of these sequences were probably acquired by horizontal transfer from l. lactis (bourgoin, f., et al., 1996. gene  178, 15-23). three probes of this 13.6kb region hybridized with the dna of several l. lactis strains tested. a specific probe for another sequence within the s. thermophilus eps locus, epsf, hybridized with the dna of one of the l. lactis strains tested. sequence comparisons also suggest that five orf of the eps locus have a mosaic structure and probably result from recombinations between sequences that are 10 to 50% divergent. the chimeric structure of the eps locus suggests a very complex evolution. this evolution probably involves both the acquisition of the 13.6kb region from l. lactis by horizontal transfer and exchanges within the s. thermophilus species.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a fermented milk product containing lactobacillus johnsonii la1 (formerly known as lactobacillus acidophilus la1) on the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy adult volunteers. furthermore, we sought to define the effective doses of the bacteria, examine the effect on respiratory burst activity, and, finally, examine the contribution made by the starter culture to the biological effects. volunteers were randomly distributed among three groups; each subject received one pot (150 ml) of fermented milk each day for 3 wk. the first two groups received a freshly prepared product fermented by streptococcus thermophilus (group a) alone or s. thermophilus and 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 (group b). group c received a product stored for a period of 21 to 28 d and that contained s. thermophilus and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1. ingestion of l. johnsonii la1 did not significantly increase fecal lactobacilli counts. however, l. johnsonii la1 was able to survive intestinal transit and was only recovered from  the feces of the volunteers of groups b and c. the fermented base alone showed a  weak effect on respiratory burst but not on phagocytic activity. however, the product containing 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 significantly enhanced both functions. the product containing 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1 had no significant effect on either function. these results suggest that fecal persistence may not necessarily reflect in vivo colonization and may not be a prerequisite for all forms of immune reactivity.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria have been reported to have benefits for the prevention and treatment of some forms of diarrhea and related conditions. to determine whether  these effects might involve direct stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune response, we administered yogurt to try to enhance mucosal and systemic antibodies against an orally presented immunogen, cholera toxin. yogurts were manufactured with starter cultures containing different species and strains of lactic acid bacteria. mice were fed these yogurts for 3 wk, during which they were also orally immunized twice with 10 micrograms of cholera toxin. blood was collected on d 0 and 21, and fecal pellets were collected weekly. mice that were  immunized orally with cholera toxin responded by producing specific intestinal and serum immunoglobulin (ig)a anti-cholera toxin. antibody responses of the iga  isotype were significantly increased in mice fed yogurts made with starters containing the conventional yogurt bacteria lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, and bifidobacterium infantis. yogurt that was manufactured with starters containing only conventional yogurt bacteria produced  less iga anti-cholera toxin than did the control group fed nonfat dry milk. although strong responses were also observed for igg anti-cholera toxin in serum, the responses did not differ among groups. thus, administration of yogurt supplemented with l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium spp. enhanced mucosal and systemic iga responses to the cholera toxin immunogen.

AB  == an increasing number of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations containing lactic acid bacteria are being promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. however, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes remain undefined. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that  basal gastrointestinal immune status in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. the specific objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of repeated oral exposure to viable and nonviable lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, and streptococcus thermophilus) in mice on basal cytokine mrna expression in mucosal (peyer's patches), systemic (spleen), and lymphoid tissue and on immunoglobulin levels. the results indicated that oral exposure to 10(9) cfu/day for up to 14 days did not significantly affect basal interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or  interleukin-6 mrna expression or total serum and intestinal immunoglobulins.

TI  == note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  == pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis and bif. bifidum), lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. the appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. of the selective media, amc, rms, npnl and bl-og performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lact. acidophilus. however, of these four media, amc was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. the amc agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.

TI  == electrotransformation of industrial strains of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == a standard electroporation procedure was utilized to introduce a range of gram-positive plasmid vectors into nine industrial strains of streptococcus thermophilus. all the strains were transformable with at least two of the plasmids assessed, but electrotransformation frequencies depended on both the strain and the nature of transforming dna. in general, small rolling circle (rc)  plasmids could be electroporated at high frequency into a wide range of strains with efficiencies of 10(2)-10(5) transformants microgram-1 of transforming dna. the presence of these plasmids did not influence doubling times during growth in  broth, and they were generally extremely stable in slow milk acidifying strains,  with 85-100% of transformants retaining the selective markers over 105 generations. vectors were less stable in fast-growing cultures. of the three theta-type plasmids assessed, only one, pil253, could be electroporated at low frequency into some slow growing strains. the presence of this plasmid caused a 40% increase in doubling time and it was lost from cells at a rate of 3% per generation. attempts to alter the proteolytic status of slow acidifying strains of strep. thermophilus by the introduction of heterologous proteinase genes are also described.

TI  == complete genomic sequence of the lytic bacteriophage dt1 of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus lytic bacteriophage dt1, isolated from a mozzarella whey, was characterized at the microbiological and molecular levels. phage dt1 had an isometric head of 60 nm and a noncontractile tail of 260 x 8 nm, two major structural proteins of 26 and 32 kda, and a linear double-stranded dna genome with cohesive ends at its extremities. the host range of phage dt1 was limited to 5 of the 21 s. thermophilus strains tested. using s. thermophilus smq-301 as a host, phage dt1 had a burst size of 276 +/- 36 and a latent period of 25 min. the genome of phage dt1 contained 34,820 bp with a gc content of 39.1%. forty-six open reading frames (orfs) of more than 40 codons were found and putative functions were assigned to 20 orfs, mostly in the late region of phage dt1. comparative genomic analysis of dt1 with the completely sequenced s. thermophilus temperate phage o1205 revealed two large homologous regions interspersed by two heterologous segments. the homologous regions consisted of the early replication  genes, the late morphogenesis genes, and the lysis cassette. the divergent segments contained the dna packaging machinery, the major structural proteins, and remnants of a lysogeny module.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == intestinal barrier function and cow's milk sensitization in guinea pigs fed milk  or fermented milk.
AB  == background: the respective effect of milk and fermented milks on intestinal barrier capacity and on sensitization to beta-lactoglobulin was studied using a guinea pig model of cow's milk allergy. methods: guinea pigs were fed a control diet or the same diet supplemented with milk, fermented milk (streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium breve), or dehydrated fermented milk. intestinal barrier capacity to macromolecules was assessed in an ussing chamber, and sensitization to cow's milk proteins was measured by systemic anti-beta-lactoglobulin immunoglobulin g1 titers and by intestinal anaphylaxis, the latter assessed by the beta-lactoglobulin-induced increase in short-circuit current of jejunal fragments (deltaisc(beta-lg)). results: the electrical resistance of jejunum was similar in the four groups (approximately 80 omega/cm2) suggesting the same paracellular permeability. the transport of 14c-beta-lactoglobulin from mucosa to serosa was significantly decreased in the animals fed dehydrated fermented milk (403+/-131 ng / hr x cm2) compared with that in control animals or animals fed milk (767+/-250 ng / hr x cm2 and 749+/-475 ng / hr x cm2, respectively; p < 0.05). milk fermentation did not modify native beta-lactoglobulin concentration but anti-beta-lactoglobulin immunoglobulin g1 titers were higher in fermented milk and dehydrated fermented milk (log10 titer = 2.86 and 2.79, respectively) than in guinea pigs fed milk (log10 titer = 2.5; p < 0.007). however, beta-lactoglobulin-induced intestinal anaphylaxis remained the same in the three groups (deltaisc(beta-lg), 9.6+/-4.1 microa/cm2, 8.5+/-4.3 microa/cm2, and 8.5+/-3.4 microa/cm2 in milk-fed, fermented milk-fed, and dehydrated fermented milk-fed guinea pigs, respectively). conclusions: the intestinal barrier capacity to milk proteins seems to be reinforced by dehydrated fermented milk, but milk and fermented milks are equally efficient in inducing cow's milk allergy in guinea pigs.

AB  == spirulina has been used for many years as human food because of its high protein  content and nutritional value. some strains also produce bioactive substances that may inhibit or promote microbial growth. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus bulgaricus were grown in rich media, mrs and rm, as well as in minimal saline medium with and without addition of extracellular products obtained from a late log phase culture of spirulina platensis in zarrouk medium. in both mrs and rm media, the extracellular products significantly promote the growth of the lactic  acid bacteria assayed. this stimulatory effect was observed in media with ph adjusted to 5.3, 6.3 and 7.0. no effect was observed in minimal saline medium.

TI  == identification and characterization of a lysis module present in a large proportion of bacteriophages infecting streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == a lysis module encoded by the temperate bacteriophage phio1205 was identified. this lysis module contains a lysin gene, designated lyt51, and two putative holin-encoding genes, designated lyt49 and lyt50. lyt51 encodes a lytic enzyme specifically directed against streptococcal cell walls. similar to other phage-encoded lysins, lyt51 appears to have a modular design in which the n-terminal portion corresponds to its enzymatic activity while the c-terminal region is responsible for its substrate binding specificity. the two putative holin-encoding genes, lyt49 and lyt50, located immediately upstream of lyt51, were identified on the basis of their homology to other identified holin-encoding genes. expression of lyt49 or lyt50 in escherichia coli was shown to cause cell death and leakage of the intracellular enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase into the growth medium without apparent lysis of the cells. southern blotting experiments  demonstrated that at least one of the three components of the identified lysis module is present in all members of a large collection of bacteriophages, indicating that components of this lysis module are widespread among bacteriophages infecting streptococcus thermophilus.

TI  == nisin independent induction of the nisa promoter in lactococcus lactis during growth in lactose or galactose.
AB  == nisin biosynthesis is autoregulated extracellularly by the mature and modified peptide. to investigate other regulatory effects on nisin biosynthesis, a transcription fusion of the nisa promoter from lactococcus lactis atcc 11454 to the promoterless lacz gene from streptococcus thermophilus was constructed. this  fusion construct, pdoc99, expressed beta-galactosidase in l. lactis atcc 11454 growing in m17 medium containing glucose (m17g). consistent with the known model  for transcription of nisa, pdoc99 did not express beta-galactosidase in the non-nisin producer, l. lactis lm0230 grown in m17g, unless the nisrk genes (cloned in pdoc23) were included in trans and nisin was added to the medium. growth of this strain in m17 containing lactose or galactose, resulted in nisa transcription, even in the absence of exogenous nisin. this expression was independent of pdoc23. furthermore, nisa transcription in l. lactis lm0230(pdoc99) grown in m17g could be induced by the addition of exogenous galactose, with maximum induction occurring at concentrations > 5 mm.

TI  == bacteria used for the production of yogurt inactivate carcinogens and prevent dna damage in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid-producing bacteria prevent carcinogen-induced preneoplastic lesions and tumors in rat colon. because the mechanisms responsible for these protective  effects are unknown, two strains of lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus ch3, that are used to produce yogurt, were investigated in vitro and in vivo to elucidate their potential to deactivate carcinogens. using the "comet assay" to detect genetic damage, we found that l. bulgaricus 191r applied orally to rats could prevent 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced dna breaks in the colon in vivo, whereas st. thermophilus ch3 were not effective. however, in vitro, both strains  prevented dna damage induced by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) in isolated primary rat colon cells. extracts prepared from milk fermented with st.  thermophilus ch3 were as efficient in deactivating mnng as was l-cysteine. isolated metabolites arising from bacteria during fermentation in the colon or in milk [l(+) lactate, d(-) lactate, palmitic acid and isopalmitic acid] were not effective. we postulate that thiol-containing breakdown products of proteins, via catalysis by bacterial proteases, could be one mechanism by which mnng or other carcinogens are deactivated in the gut lumen resulting in reduced damage to colonic mucosal cells.

TI  == phosphorylation and functional properties of the iia domain of the lactose transport protein of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the lactose-h+ symport protein (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus has a carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain (iialacs) that is homologous to a family of proteins and protein domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (pts) in various organisms, of which iiaglc of escherichia coli is the best-characterized member. on the basis of these similarities, it was anticipated that iialacs would be able to perform one or more functions associated with iiaglc, i.e., carry out phosphoryl transfer and/or affect other catabolic functions. the gene fragment encoding iialacs was overexpressed in escherichia coli, and the protein was purified in two steps by metal affinity and anion-exchange chromatography. iialacs was unable to restore glucose uptake in a iiaglc-deficient strain, which is consistent with a very low  rate of phosphorylation of iialacs by phosphorylated hpr (hpr approximately p) from e. coli. with hpr approximately p from s. thermophilus, the rate was more than 10-fold higher, but the rate constants for the phosphorylation of iialacs (k1 = 4.3 x 10(2) m-1 s-1) and dephosphorylation of iialacs approximately p by hpr (k-1 = 1.1 x 10(3) m-1 s-1) are still at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than for the phosphoryltransfer between iiaglc and hpr from e. coli. this finding suggests that iialacs has evolved into a protein domain whose main function is not to transfer phosphoryl groups rapidly. on the basis of sequence alignment of  iia proteins with and without putative phosphoryl transfer functions and the known structure of iiaglc, we constructed a double mutant [iialacs(i548e/g556d)]  that was predicted to have increased phosphoryl transfer activity. indeed, the phosphorylation rate of iialacs(i548e/g556d) by hpr approximately p increased (k1 = 4.0 x 10(3) m-1 s-1) and became nearly independent of the source of hpr approximately p (s. thermophilus, bacillus subtilis, or e. coli). the increased phosphoryl transfer rate of iialacs(i548e/g556d) was insufficient to complement iiaglc in pts-mediated glucose transport in e. coli. both iialacs and iialacs(i548e/g556d) could replace iiaglc, but in another function: they inhibited glycerol kinase (inducer exclusion) when present in the unphosphorylated form.

TI  == persistence of escherichia coli o157:h7 in dairy fermentation systems.
AB  == we examined (i) the persistence of escherichia coli o157:h7 as a postpasteurization contaminant in fermented dairy products; (ii) the ability of e. coli o157:h7 strains with and without the general stress regulatory protein, rpos, to compete with commercial starter cultures in fermentation systems; and (iii) the survival of e. coli o157:h7 in the yogurt production process. in commercial products inoculated with 10(3) cfu/ml, e. coli o157:h7 was recovered for up to 12 days in yogurt (ph 4.0), 28 days in sour cream (ph 4.3), and at levels > 10(2) cfu/ml at 35 days in buttermilk (ph 4.1). for the starter culture  competition trials, the relative inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 in the experimental fermentation systems was, in decreasing order, thermophilic culture  mixture, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus r110 alone, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis d280 alone, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris d62 alone, and streptococcus thermophilus c90 alone showing the least inhibition. recovery of the rpos mutant was lower than recovery of its wild-type parent by 72 h or earlier in the presence of individual starter cultures. no e. coli o157:h7 were recovered after the curd formation step in yogurt manufactured with milk inoculated with 10(5) cfu/ml. our results show that (i) postprocessing entry of e. coli o157:h7 into fermented dairy products represents a potential health hazard; (ii) commercial starter cultures differ in their ability to reduce e. coli o157:h7 cfu numbers in fermentation systems; and (iii) the rpos protein appears to most effectively contribute to bacterial survival in the presence of conditions that are moderately lethal to the cell.

TI  == detergent-mediated reconstitution of membrane proteins.
AB  == the efficiency of reconstitution of the lactose transport protein (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus is markedly higher with triton x-100 than with other detergents commonly employed to mediate the membrane insertion. to rationalize these differences, the lipid/detergent structures that are formed in the reconstitution process were studied by cryotransmission electron microscopy. surprisingly, the two nonionic detergents triton x-100 and n-dodecyl beta-d-maltoside (ddm) affected the liposome structures in a completely different manner. preformed liposomes titrated with triton x-100 maintained their bilayer structure far beyond the onset of solubilization, and transport activity was maximal when lacs was inserted into these structures. with ddm the vesicular structures were already disrupted at the onset of solubilization and these membrane sheets were converted into long threadlike micelles at higher ddm to lipid ratios. triton x-100 allowed the protein to be reconstituted with the hydrophilic surface exposed to the outside, whereas lacs was incorporated randomly when ddm was used. these differences in orientation are readily explained by the different lipid-detergent structures formed by triton x-100 and  ddm. the orientation of the reconstituted lacs protein is a critical factor for the activity of the protein as the kinetics of translocation is very different for opposite directions of transport.

TI  == a short noncoding viral dna element showing characteristics of a replication origin confers bacteriophage resistance to streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == a 302-bp noncoding dna fragment from the dna replication module of phage phisfi21 was shown to protect the streptococcus thermophilus strain sfi1 from infection by 17 of 25 phages. the phage-inhibitory dna possesses two determinants, each of which individually mediated phage resistance. the phage-inhibitory activity was copy number dependent and operates by blocking the accumulation of phage dna. furthermore, when cloned on a plasmid, the phisfi21 dna acts as an origin of replication driven by phage infection. protein or proteins in the phisfi21-infected cells were shown to interact with this phage-inhibitory dna fragment, forming a retarded protein-dna complex in gel retardation assays. a model in which phage proteins interact with the inhibitory dna such that they are no longer available for phage propagation can be used to explain the observed bacteriophage resistance. genome analysis of phisfi19, a phage that is insensitive to the inhibitory activity of the phisfi21-derived dna, led to the characterisation of a variant putative phage replication origin that differed in  14 of 302 nucleotides from that of phisfi21. the variant origin was cloned and exhibited an inhibitory activity toward phages that were insensitive to the phisfi21-derived dna.

TI  == random amplified polymorphic dna and amplified ribosomal dna spacer polymorphism: powerful methods to differentiate streptococcus thermophilus strains.
AB  == streptococci from different collections and dairy materials were characterized by conventional and molecular methods. after amplification of the 16s-23s rdna spacer region, all the strains referable to the genus streptococcus exhibited a single polymerase chain reaction (pcr) product, allowing their differentiation from enterococci. cleaving this pcr product with hae iii, two different restriction patterns could be observed, allowing streptococcus salivarius dsm 20560t, strep. thermophilus ncdo 822 and two strains of streptococcus spp. to be  gathered in one group and all the other strains in another. in order to achieve strain typing, all the cultures were investigated by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis employing two selected primers. the results were treated  by cluster analysis, appearing significantly consistent with both the taxonomic position and the origin of the strains. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of sma i digests of the genomic dna from 11 representative strains with decreasing levels of rapd similarity allowed their diversity to be confirmed, even though rapd-pcr proved to be less discriminating than pfge analysis. the results are discussed with reference to the capability of the analytical procedures used to aid both identification and strain typing of streptococci, as  well as the taxonomic structure of the species strep. thermophilus.

TI  == production by and isolation of exopolysaccharides from streptococcus thermophilus grown in a milk medium and evidence for their growth-associated biosynthesis.
AB  == four streptococcus thermophilus strains (strep. thermophilus btc, strep. thermophilus ly03, strep. thermophilus 480 and strep. thermophilus sfi20) have been examined for their exopolysaccharide production capacity. all strains produced a polymer composed of the neutral sugars glucose and galactose, but in different ratios. it was clearly shown that the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides from strep. thermophilus ly03 is growth-associated and hence displays primary metabolite kinetics. the monomer ratio of the exopolysaccharide  synthesized did not vary throughout the fermentation cycle. the production kinetics and exopolysaccharide yields were strongly dependent on the fermentation conditions. physical factors such as temperature, ph and oxygen tension as well as chemical factors (medium composition, initial lactose concentration, carbon/nitrogen levels) were of utmost importance.

TI  == small cryptic plasmids of streptococcus pneumoniae belong to the pc194/pub110 family of rolling circle plasmids.
AB  == the dna sequences of two related plasmids ppr1 and ppr3 described previously in streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from germany and spain were now determined. both plasmids belong to a family of rolling circle (rc) plasmids found in a variety of bacteria. their gc content with 32% is lower than that of the s. pneumoniae chromosomal dna. the plasmid ppr3 has a molecular size of 3160 bp with four putative open reading frames, whereas ppr1 contained a deletion of 313 bp that included the 5'-part of orf2 and upstream regions and differed by three bp from ppr3. the predicted protein of orf1 showed high similarity to replication proteins of rc plasmids with 74% identical amino acids to repa of streptococcus thermophilus plasmids. sequences similar to the plus origin of replication of ssdna plasmids were present in both plasmids. they also contained a 152-bp region with over 83% identity to the minus origin of replication of the streptococcus agalacticae plasmid pmv158.

AB  == in this study, biochemical properties of two extracellular beta-lactamases produced by penicillin-resistant streptococcus thermophilus cells were investigated. both beta-lactamases showed specificity for penicillins but not for cephaloridins. the beta-lactamases exhibited different affinities for penicillin  g. the one with the higher molecular weight (fi) had a km value of 3.44 microm and a vmax value of 8.33 mumol/min/mg of protein, whereas the beta-lactamase with the lower molecular weight (fii) had a km value of 4.76 microm and a vmax value of 3.13 mumol/min/mg of protein. both beta-lactamases were inhibited by iodine, copper sulfate, and iron sulfate but not by edta. the optimal ph ranged between 6 and 7, and the optimal temperatures were between 40 and 45 degrees c for both enzymes.

TI  == stimulation of cytokine production in clonal macrophage and t-cell models by streptococcus thermophilus: comparison with bifidobacterium sp. and lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  == the effects of four commercial strains of streptococcus thermophilus used in yogurt manufacturing on cytokine production were evaluated by using a macrophage  model (raw 264.7 cells) and a t-helper-cell model (el4.il-2 thymoma cells) and compared to immunologically active strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium bifidum. all cytokines (tnf-alpha and il-6 in raw 264.7 cells and il-2 and il-5 in el4.il-2 cells) were  affected by heat-killed s. thermophilus in a strain- and dose-dependent fashion.  organisms of all three genera induced significant increases in il-6 production by the macrophage line ranging from 31- to 192-fold, with s. thermophilus st 133 showing the greatest activity. the four s. thermophilus strains also strongly induced tnf-alpha production (from 135- to 176-fold). il-6 and, to a lesser extent, tnf-alpha production were also increased when the macrophages were costimulated with lipopolysaccharide and cells of the three groups of lactic acid bacteria. upon concurrent stimulation of el4.il-2 cells with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate, seven of the eight strains displayed significant enhancement of il-2 and il-5 production, with s. thermophilus being most effective. taken together, the s. thermophilus strains stimulated macrophage and  t-cell cytokine production to a similar or greater extent than did the species of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus. these and previous results lend further support to the contention that lactic acid bacteria, in a concentration-dependent manner, can differentially induce cytokine production in macrophages, but that the effects on t cells required a costimulatory signal and were less remarkable.

TI  == structural and functional properties of the hsp16.4-bearing plasmid per341 in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the plasmid per341 (2798 bp) of streptococcus thermophilus st134 was sequenced and its open reading frame (orf) regions were characterized. analysis of nucleotide sequences showed the putative translation product of orf1 (rep) sharing a high level of homology with replication proteins of several small plasmids present in lactic acid bacteria and staphylococci. this and homology of  regions of plus-strand (ori) and minus-strand (ssoa) origin of replication with pc194-class plasmids indicated that per341 replicates by the rolling-circle mechanism. orf2 corresponded to a putative hsp gene that apparently encodes hsp16.4, a 142-amino-acid heat stress protein. hsp16.4 shared significant identity with other small, 18-kda-class heat stress proteins from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources. hsp16.4 is apparently the first plasmidborne low-molecular-weight heat stress protein reported in dairy fermentation bacteria  with a potential role in temperature-regulated functions in s. thermophilus.

TI  == characterization of a novel insertion sequence, is1194, in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == a novel insertion sequence, is1194, has been identified in the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368. this 1200-bp element has 16-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the single large open reading frame of this  element encodes a 332-amino-acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is5 group  of the is4 family. a single copy of is1194 was detected by hybridization in only  2 of the 19 s. thermophilus strains tested and in 4 of the 13 lactococcus lactis  strains investigated. this suggests that this is element was acquired by horizontal transfer. the unique is1194 copy of s. thermophilus cnrz368 is located in a region of at least 12 kb that was probably acquired by horizontal transfer from l. lactis. furthermore, the is1194 right end is identical to sequences found in a broad-host-range conjugative plasmid from streptococcus pyogenes, psm19035.

TI  == the structural gene module in streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage phi sfi11  shows a hierarchy of relatedness to siphoviridae from a wide range of bacterial hosts.
AB  == the structural gene cluster and the lysis module from lytic group ii streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage phi sfi11 was compared to the corresponding region from other siphoviridae. the analysis revealed a hierarchy of relatedness. phi sfi11 differed from the temperate s. thermophilus bacteriophage phi o1205 by about 10% at the nucleotide level. the majority of the changes were point mutations, mainly at the third base position. only a single gene (orf 695) differed substantially between the two phages. over the putative minor tail and lysis genes, phi sfi11 and the lytic group 1 s. thermophilus phi sfi19 shared regions with variable degrees of similarity. orf 1291 from phi sfi19 was replaced by four genes in phi sfi11, two of which (orf 1000 and orf 695) showed a complicated pattern of similarity and nonsimilarity compared with phi sfi19. the predicted orf 695 gp resembles the receptor-recognizing protein of t-even coliphages in its organization, but not its sequence. no sequence similarity was detected between phi sfi11 and phi sfi19 in the region covering the major head and tail genes. comparison of the structural gene map of phi sfi11 with that of siphoviridae from gram-positive and -negative bacterial hosts revealed a common genomic organization. sequence similarity was only found between phi sfi11 and siphoviridae from gram-positive hosts and correlated with the evolutionary distance between the bacterial hosts. our data are compatible with the hypothesis that the structural gene operon from siphoviridae of the low  g + c group of gram-positive bacteria is derived from a common ancestor.

TI  == purification and characterization of thermophilin t, a novel bacteriocin produced by streptococcus thermophilus aca-dc 0040.

TI  == cell-free whey from milk fermented with bifidobacterium breve c50 used to modify  the colonic microflora of healthy subjects.
AB  == the ingestion of viable bacteria is thought to be required to modify intestinal microflora. in the present study, the effects on fecal flora of consumption of cell-free concentrated whey from milk that had been fermented with bifidobacterium breve c50 was tested using 10 healthy human volunteers. results were compared with effects of a commercial milk formula that had been fermented with streptococcus thermophilus and b. breve c50 and given to 10 control subjects. nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase activities were assessed as risk  indexes for colon carcinogenesis, and beta-galactosidase was measured as an indicator of the fermentation capacity of the colonic flora. fecal excretion of bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and clostridial spores decreased after 7 d of consumption of either preparation; however, counts of bifidobacteria only increased after intake of b. breve whey. fecal ph was reduced from 7.1 +/- 0.2 to 6.6 +/- 0.3 after intake of whey that had been fermented with bif. breve.  fecal nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase significantly decreased, and beta-galactosidase activity increased, after consumption of either preparation. the results indicate that ingestion of viable bifidobacteria was not required to  modify intestinal flora of humans. repression of b. fragilis and clostridia seems to be independent of colonic bifidobacterial overgrowth in humans.

TI  == role of streptococcus thermophilus mr-1c capsular exopolysaccharide in cheese moisture retention.
AB  == recent work by our group has shown that an exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing starter pair, streptococcus thermophilus mr-1c and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus mr-1r, can significantly increase moisture retention in low-fat mozzarella (d. b. perry, d. j. mcmahon, and c. j. oberg, j. dairy sci. 80:799-805, 1997). the objectives of this study were to determine whether mr-1c,  mr-1r, or both of these strains are required for enhanced moisture retention and  to establish the role of eps in this phenomenon. analysis of low-fat mozzarella made with different combinations of mr-1c, mr-1r, and the non-eps-producing starter culture strains s. thermophilus ta061 and lactobacillus helveticus lh100  showed that s. thermophilus mr-1c was responsible for the increased cheese moisture level. to investigate the role of the s. thermophilus mr-1c eps in cheese moisture retention, the epse gene in this bacterium was inactivated by gene replacement. low-fat mozzarella made with l. helveticus lh100 plus the non-eps-producing mutant s. thermophilus dm10 had a significantly lower moisture  content than did cheese made with strains lh100 and mr-1c, which confirmed that the mr-1c capsular eps was responsible for the water-binding properties of this bacterium in cheese. chemical analysis of the s. thermophilus mr-1c eps indicated that the polymer has a novel basic repeating unit composed of d-galactose, l-rhamnose, and l-fucose in a ratio of 5:2:1.

TI  == effect of fermented milk intake on plasmid transfer and on the persistence of transconjugants in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == plasmid transfer occurs in the digestive tract and the transconjugants may become durably established. the aim of the present work is to investigate the effect of  probiotics of plasmid transfer and on establishment of transconjugants in the gut. plasmid transfers were carried out in the digestive tract of germ free mice  associated with an e. coli k12 donor strain harboring three plasmids (r388, self-transmissible, pce325 and pub2380, mobilisable,) and an e. coli recipient strain, pg1, of human origin (duval-iflah et al., 1994). milks fermented with either lactobacillus bulgaricus or streptococcus thermophilus or symbiosis, s85,  of both strains were given daily as 1/3 of food diet. fermented milks have no effect on the transfer of r388 and pub2380 except a slight increase of tc(r388) with milk fermented with s85. long term ingestion of milk fermented with s85 inhibited the formation and the establishment of transconjugants tc(pce325). milk fermented with l. bulgaricus lowered the population density of tc(pce325) in animals where they were already established. this phenomenon was reversible, since the density of tc(pce325) increased in the same animals after cessation of  supplementation. bacterial cultures obtained in mrs broth and given in state of drinking water were compared with fermented milks. bacterial cultures with l. bulgaricus and with s85 favoured the establishment of tc(pce325). there results indicate for the first time that probiotics have various effects on the formation and/or establishment of transconjugants in the gut of axenic mice. the effects depend on whether the probiotics were cultivated in milk or in mrs, indicating that bacterial metabolites and viable bacteria can be involved.

TI  == chromosome geometry and intraspecific genetic polymorphism in gram-positive bacteria revealed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) proved to be a powerful approach to study bacterial genomics. the genome structure and genetic polymorphism of gram-positive bacteria from the high g+c (streptomyces) and low g+c (streptococcus) groups have been studied. pfge allowed the estimation of the size of their genome at about 8 mbp and 1.8 mbp, respectively, and to get an insight into their chromosome geometry. thus, physical mapping of the genome of wild-type streptomyces ambofaciens strains revealed the linearity of the 8 mbp chromosomal  dna and its typical invertron structure, while the 1.8 mbp chromosome of streptococcus thermophilus was shown to be circular. these findings disproved the long-standing idea of universality of bacterial chromosome circularity. in addition, strains belonging to the species s. ambofaciens and s. thermophilus allowed us to characterize the genetic polymorphism at the intraspecific level. within the s. thermophilus species, comparison of the physical maps showed a relative conservation of gene order as well as restriction sites along the chromosome. in contrast, variable loci were characterized that revealed localized genome rearrangements. the most spectacular of these corresponded to horizontal gene transfer events of sequences. in s. ambofaciens, the physical maps of three  isolates pointed to the conservation of the genetic organization. however, a strong polymorphism was observed in the terminal regions of the linear chromosomal dna. previous pfge studies in s. ambofaciens gave proof of a high structural instability of a limited region of the chromosome called unstable region (i.e., dna rearrangements such as deletions and amplifications). these intraclonal rearrangements create an impressive intraspecific polymorphism of genome size and shape (linear or circular). in both organisms, the dna rearrangements are restricted to particular regions of the chromosome.

TI  == molecular ecology and evolution of streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages--a review.
AB  == bacteriophages attacking streptococcus thermophilus, a lactic acid bacterium used in milk fermentation, are a threat to the dairy industry. these small isometric-headed phages possess double-stranded dna genomes of 31 to 45 kb. yoghurt-derived phages exhibit a limited degree of variability, as defined by restriction pattern and host range, while a large diversity of phage types have been isolated from cheese factories. despite this diversity all s. thermophilus phages, virulent and temperate, belong to a single dna homology group. several mechanisms appear to create genetic variability in this phage group. site-specific deletions, one type possibly mediated by a viral recombinase/integrase, which transformed a temperate into a virulent phage, were  observed. recombination as a result of superinfection of a lysogenic host has been reported. comparative dna sequencing identified up to 10% sequence diversity due to point mutations. genome sequencing of the prototype temperate phage phi sfi21 revealed many predicted proteins which showed homology with phages from lactococcus lactis suggesting horizontal gene transfer. homology with phages from evolutionary unrelated bacteria like e. coli (e.g. lambdoid phage 434 and p1) and mycobacterium phi l5 was also found. due to their industrial importance, the existence of large phage collections, and the whole phage genome sequencing projects which are currently underway, the s. thermophilus phages may present an  interesting experimental system to study bacteriophage evolution.

TI  == evolution of streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage genomes by modular exchanges followed by point mutations and small deletions and insertions.
AB  == comparative sequence analysis of 40% of the genomes from two prototype streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages (lytic group i phage phi sfi19 and the  cos site containing temperate phage phi sfi21) suggested two processes in the evolution of their genomes. in a first evolutionarily distant phase the basic genome structure was apparently constituted by modular exchanges. over the 17-kb-long dna segment analyzed in the present report, we observed clusters of genes with similarity to genes from leuconostoc oenos phage l10, lactococcus lactis phage bk5-t, and streptococcus pneumoniae phage dp-1. a chimeric protein was predicted for orf 1291 which showed similarity to both phage bk5-t and phage  dp-1 proteins. the very large orf 1626 gene product showed similarity to two adjacent genes from the lactobacillus delbrueckii phage ll-h and further phage proteins (lactococcus lactis, bacillus subtills). the similarities were localized to distinct parts of this apparently multifunctional protein. the putative phi sfi19 lysin showed similarity to both lysins of phages and cellular enzymes. in a second, evolutionarily more recent, phase the s, thermophilus phage genomes apparently diversified by point mutations and small deletions/insertions. over the investigated 17-kb dna region phi sfi19 differed from phi sfi21 by 10% base pair changes, the majority of which were point mutations (mainly at the third codon position), while a third of the base pair differences were contributed by small deletions/insertions. the base pair changes were unevenly distributed. over the leuconostoc phage-related dna the change rate was high, while over the lactococcus and s. pneumoniae phage-related dna the change rate was low. we speculate that the degree of base pair change could provide relative time scales  for the modular exchange reactions observed in s. thermophilus phages.

TI  == comparison of the lysogeny modules from the temperate streptococcus thermophilus  bacteriophages tp-j34 and sfi21: implications for the modular theory of phage evolution.
AB  == a 7.6-kb dna segment covering the putative lysogeny module of the pac-site-containing temperate streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage tp-j34 was sequenced. sequence alignment with the lysogeny module from the cos-site-containing s. thermophilus bacteriophage phisfi21 revealed areas of high sequence conservation (e.g., over the int gene), interspersed with regions of low or no sequence similarity (e.g., over the cro gene). four of the six sharp transition zones from high to low sequence conservation were found within open reading frames coding for the ci repressor, the anti-repressor, the immunity protein, and a protein of unknown function. the transition points in the ci and ant genes appear to separate gene segments coding for distinct functional domains of these proteins. in addition, these two transition points were located at or near the deletion sites observed in spontaneous phage phisfi21 deletion mutants,  thus suggesting these transition points as recombinational hotspots. furthermore, the sequence at the transition point in the ci gene resembles the attachment site of the phage, suggesting the involvement of the phage integrase in at least some  of the exchange reactions. contrary to the initial formulation of the modular theory of phage evolution the unit of the evolutionary exchange in streptococcal  phages is not a group of functional genes, but can be as small as a single gene.  exchange reactions can also occur within genes, possibly between gene segments encoding distinct protein domains.

TI  == molecular characterization of a phage-inducible middle promoter and its transcriptional activator from the lactococcal bacteriophage phi31.
AB  == an inducible middle promoter from the lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 was isolated previously by shotgun cloning an 888-bp fragment (p15a10) upstream of the beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) gene (lacz.st) from streptococcus thermophilus  (d. j. o'sullivan, s. a. walker, s. g. west, and t. r. klaenhammer, bio/technology 14:82-87, 1996). the promoter showed low levels of constitutive beta-gal activity which could be induced two- to threefold over baseline levels after phage infection. during this study, the fragment was subcloned and characterized to identify a smaller, tightly regulated promoter fragment which allowed no beta-gal activity until after phage infection. this fragment, defined  within nucleotides 566 to 888 (p(566-888); also called fragment 566-888), contained tandem, phage-inducible transcription start sites at nucleotides 703 and 744 (703/744 start sites). consensus -10 regions were present upstream of both start sites, but no consensus -35 regions were identified for either start site. a transcriptional activator, encoded by an open reading frame (orf2) upstream of the 703/744 start sites, was identified for p(566-888). orf2 activated p(566-888) when provided in trans in escherichia coli. in addition, when combined with ptrk391 (p15a10::lacz.st) in lactococcus lactis nck203, an antisense orf2 construct was able to retard induction of the phage-inducible promoter as measured by beta-gal activity levels. finally, gel shift assays showed that orf2 was able to bind to promoter fragment 566-888. deletion analysis of the region upstream from the tandem promoters identified a possible binding site for transcriptional activation of the phage promoters. the dna-binding ability of orf2 was eliminated upon deletion of part of this region, which lies centered approximately 35 bp upstream of start site 703. deletion analysis and mutagenesis studies also elucidated a critical region downstream of the 703/744 start sites, where mutagenesis resulted in a two- to threefold increase in beta-gal activity. with these improvements, the level of expression achieved by an explosive-expression strategy was elevated from 3,000 to 11,000 beta-gal units within 120 min after induction.

AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of phi o1205, a temperate bacteriophage infecting streptococcus thermophilus strain cnrz1205, was determined. the phage genome has a unit length of 43,075 bp and appears to be packaged by the so-called headful mechanism. the genomic organization and structure of phi o1205 resemble those of several temperate lactococcal phages that display a life-cycle-specific  organization, where orfs believed to be involved in the lysogenic life-cycle are  clustered and arranged in an orientation opposite to the orfs supposedly involved in the lytic life-cycle. database searches revealed putative functions for several identified orfs and further indicated that phi o1205 is genetically related to a particular group of lactococcal phages. three genes encoding the major structural proteins were identified on the phi o1205 genome. the phage attachment site attp, the bacterial attachment site attb, and the two phage/chromosome junctions attl and attr were identified and found to contain a 40 bp common core sequence.

TI  == application of the extracellular alpha-amylase gene from streptococcus bovis 148  to construction of a secretion vector for yogurt starter strains.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus atcc 19258, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus t-11, and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 were transformed with the alpha-amylase gene (amya) from streptococcus bovis 148 by using a wide host-range vector, and all the transformants secreted the alpha-amylase successfully. since the promoter and the secretion signal of the amya gene were functional in these strains, we constructed a secretion vector using the expression elements of amya. trials to secrete foreign enzymes in yogurt starter  strains were performed using this novel secretion vector.

TI  == the association of yogurt starters with lactobacillus casei dn 114.001 in fermented milk alters the composition and metabolism of intestinal microflora in  germ-free rats and in human flora-associated rats.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the effects of milk and of various fermented milks on the composition and metabolic activities of the intestinal microflora. groups of eight rats were fed for 6 wk a diet containing 30% nonfermented milk (m), yogurt (y), milk fermented with lactobacillus casei (lcfm) or milk fermented with the association of l. casei dn 114.001 and yogurt starters (lcyfm). in the first study, the survival of the lactic acid bacteria from the fermented milks was assessed by bacterial enumeration in feces of germ-free rats (gf rats) fed milk or fermented milks. the metabolic activities of the lactic acid bacteria were studied in these rats by the measurement of glycolytic activities and products of bacterial fermentation, i.e., acetate and lactate (isoforms l and d). in a second study, the effects of fermented milks on the composition and metabolism [gas, glycolytic activities, short-chain fatty acids (scfa), alcohol and ammonia] of human flora were studied using human flora-associated rats (hf rats). in gf rats, the survival of l. casei in the feces did not differ between those fed the lcfm and lcyfm diets. l. bulgaricus was detected in the feces of the rats fed y, whereas streptoccus thermophilus was found in the feces of the lcyfm group. in hf rats, fecal concentration of bifidobacteria was greater in the lcfm group than in the others. beta-glucuronidase (ec 3.2.1.31) activity was lower in rats fed lcfm and y than in those fed m and lcyfm, whereas beta-galactosidase (3.2.1.23), alpha-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1 20) and beta-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.21) activities were higher in the lcyfm group compared with the others. methane excretion was higher in rats fed y than in other groups. cecal scfa concentrations did not differ in lcfm, y and m groups, but total scfa, acetate, propionate and butyrate were significantly greater in the lcyfm group. these results suggest that milk fermented with the combination of l. casei and yogurt starters leads to specific effects that are different from the simple addition of the effects found with yogurt and milk fermented with l. casei. these specific effects are potentially beneficial to human health.

TI  == the site-specific integration system of the temperate streptococcus thermophilus  bacteriophage phisfi21.
AB  == the temperate bacteriophage phisfi21 integrates its dna into the chromosome of streptococcus thermophilus strains via site-specific recombination. nucleotide sequencing of the attachment sites identified a 40-bp identity region which surprisingly overlaps both the 18-terminal bp of the phage integrase gene and the 11-terminal bp of a host trnaarg gene. a 2.4-kb phage dna segment, covering attp, the phage integrase, and a likely immunity gene contained all the genetic information for faithful integration of a nonreplicative plasmid into the attb site. a deletion within the int gene led to the loss of integration proficiency.  a number of spontaneous deletions were observed in plasmids containing the 2.4-kb phage dna segment. the deletion sites were localized to the trna side of the identity region and to phage or vector dna with 3- to 6-bp-long repeats from the  border region. a similar type of deletion was previously observed in a spontaneous phage mutant.

TI  == streptococcus thermophilus and its biosurfactants inhibit adhesion by candida spp. on silicone rubber.
AB  == the adhesion of yeasts, two candida albicans and two candida tropicalis strains isolated from naturally colonized voice prostheses, to silicone rubber with and without a salivary conditioning film in the absence and presence of adhering streptococcus thermophilus b, a biosurfactant-releasing dairy isolate, was studied. coverage of 1 to 4% of the surface of silicone rubber substrata with adhering s. thermophilus b gave significant reductions in the initial yeast adhesion regardless of the presence of a conditioning film. mechanistically, this interference in yeast adhesion by s. thermophilus b was not due to direct physical effects but to biosurfactant release by the adhering bacteria, because experiments with s. thermophilus b cells that had released their biosurfactants prior to adhesion to silicone rubber and competition with yeasts did not show interference with initial yeast adhesion. the amounts of biosurfactants released  were highest for mid-exponential- and early-stationary-phase bacteria (37 mg.g of cells-1 [dry weight]), but biosurfactants released by stationary-phase bacteria (14 mg.g of cells-1 [dry weight]) were the most surface active. the crude biosurfactants released were mixtures of various components, with a glycolipid-like component being the most surface active. a lipid-enriched biosurfactant fraction reduced the surface tension of an aqueous solution to about 35 mj.m-2 at a concentration of only 0.5 mg.ml-1. the amount of biosurfactant released per s. thermophilus b cell was estimated to be sufficient  to cover approximately 12 times the area of the cross section of the bacterium, making biosurfactant release a powerful defense weapon in the postadhesion competition of the bacterium with microorganisms such as yeasts. preadsorption of biosurfactants to the silicone rubber prior to allowing yeasts to adhere was as effective against c. albicans gb 1/2 adhesion as covering 1 to 2% of the silicone rubber surface with adhering s. thermophilus b, but a preadsorbed biosurfactant layer was less effective against c. tropicalis gb 9/9.

TI  == a highly conserved dna replication module from streptococcus thermophilus phages  is similar in sequence and topology to a module from lactococcus lactis phages.
AB  == a highly conserved dna region extending over 5 kb was observed in streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages. comparative sequencing of one temperate and 26 virulent phages demonstrated in the most extreme case an 18% aa difference for a  predicted protein, while the majority of the phages showed fewer, if any aa changes. the relative degree of aa conservation was not homogeneous over the dna  segment investigated. sequence analysis of the conserved segment revealed genes possibly involved in dna transactions. three predicted proteins (orf 233, 443, and 382 gene product (gp)) showed nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. orf 443 gp showed in addition a deah box motif, characteristically found in a subgroup of helicases, and a variant zinc finger motif known from a phage t7 helicase/primase. tree analysis classified orf 443 gp as a distant member of the  helicase superfamily. orf 382 gp showed similarity to putative plasmid dna primases. downstream of orf 382 a noncoding repeat region was identified that showed similarity to a putative minus origin from a cryptic s. thermophilus plasmid. four predicted proteins showed not only high degrees of aa identity (34  to 63%) with proteins from lactococcus lactis phages, but their genes showed a similar topological organization. we interpret this as evidence for a horizontal  gene transfer event between phages of the two bacterial genera in the distant past.

TI  == two groups of bacteriophages infecting streptococcus thermophilus can be distinguished on the basis of mode of packaging and genetic determinants for major structural proteins.
AB  == a comparative study of 30 phages of streptococcus thermophilus was performed based on dna restriction profiles, dna homology, structural proteins, packaging mechanisms, and host range data. all phages exhibited distinct dna restriction profiles, with some phages displaying similarly sized restriction fragments. dna  homology was shown to be present among all 30 phages. the phages could be divided into two groups on the basis of their packaging mechanism as was derived from the appearance of submolar dna fragments in restriction enzyme digests and the presence (cos-containing phages) or absence (pac-containing phages) of cohesive genomic extremities. interestingly, the 19 identified cos-containing phages possessed two major structural proteins (32 and 26 kda) in contrast to the remaining 11 pac-containing phages, which possessed three major structural proteins (41, 25, and 13 kda). southern hybridization demonstrated that all pac-containing phages tested contain homologs of the genes encoding the three major structural proteins of the pac-containing phage o1205, whereas all cos-containing phages tested exhibit homology to the gene specifying one of the structural components of the cos-containing phage phi 7201. fifty-seven percent of the phages (both cos and pac containing) possessed the previously identified 2.2-kb ecori fragment of the temperate s. thermophilus phage sfi18 (h. brussow, a. probst, m. fremont, and j. sidoti, virology 200:854-857, 1994). no obvious correlation was detected between grouping based on packaging mechanism and host range data obtained with 39 industrial s. thermophilus strains.

TI  == molecular ecology of streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage infections in a cheese factory.
AB  == a mozzarella cheese factory using an undefined, milk-derived streptococcus thermophilus starter system was monitored longitudinally for 2 years to determine whether the diversity of the resident bacteriophage population arose from environmental sources or from genetic changes in the resident phage in the factory. the two hypotheses led to different predictions about the genetic diversity of the phages. with respect to host range, 12 distinct phage types were observed. with two exceptions, phages belonging to different lytic groups showed  clearly distinct restriction patterns and multiple isolates of phages showing the same host range exhibited identical or highly related restriction patterns. sequencing studies in a conserved region of the phage genome revealed no point mutations in multiple isolates of the same phage type, while up to 12% nucleotide sequence diversity was observed between the different phage types. this diversity is as large as that between the most different sequences from phages in our collection. these observations make unlikely a model that postulates a single phage invasion event and diversification of the phage during its residence in the factory. in the second stage of our factory study, a defined starter system was introduced that could not propagate the resident factory phage population. within a week, three new phage types were observed in the factory while the resident phage population was decreased but not eliminated. raw milk was the most likely source of these new phages, as phages with identical host ranges and restriction  patterns were isolated from raw milk delivered to the factory during the intervention trial. apparently, all of the genetic diversity observed in the s. thermophilus phages isolated during our survey was already created in their natural environment. a better understanding of the raw-milk ecology of s. thermophilus phages is thus essential for successful practical phage control.

TI  == influence of charge differences in the c-terminal part of nisin on antimicrobial  activity and signaling capacity.
AB  == three mutants of the antibiotic nisin z, in which the val32 residue was replaced  by a glu, lys or trp residue, were produced and characterized for the purpose of  establishing the role of charge differences in the c-terminal part of nisin on antimicrobial activity and signaling properties. 1h-nmr analyses showed that all  three mutants harbor an unmodified serine residue at position 33, instead of the  usual dehydroalanine. apparently, the nature of the residue preceding the serine  to be dehydrated, strongly affects the efficiency of modification. cleavage of [glu32,ser33]nisin z by endoproteinase glu-c yielded [glu32]nisin z(1-32)-peptide, which has a net charge difference of -2 relative to wild-type nisin z. the activity of [lys32,ser33]nisin z against micrococcus flavus was similar to that of wild-type nisin, while [trp32,ser33]nisin z, [glu32,ser33]nisin z and [glu32]nisin z(1-32)-peptide exhibited 3-5-fold reduced  activity, indicating that negative charges in the c-terminal part of nisin z are  detrimental for activity. all variants showed significant loss of activity against streptococcus thermophilus. the potency of the nisin variants to act as signaling molecules for auto-induction of biosynthesis was significantly reduced. to obtain mutant production, extracellular addition of (mutant) nisin z to the lactococcal expression strains was essential.

AB  == when lactic acid bacterial cultures were frozen at -20 degrees c for 24 h, the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees c for 2 h prior to freezing, viability improved significantly for the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (25-37%) and pediococcus pentosaceus po2 (18%), but not for the lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains tested or for one strain of lactobacillus helveticus lb1 and streptococcus thermophilus ts2. when the period for cold shock was extended to 5 h, the viability increased even  further for those strains that displayed cold shock cryotolerance. use of degenerate pcr primers based on the major cold shock protein (csp) of both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis resulted in pcr products from all strains  tested. the pcr product from lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis m474 was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other csp's. use of pcr primers based on the m474 sequence resulted in pcr products being produced only from the lactococcal strains studied and not  from the lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, or pediococcus pentosaceus strains tested.

TI  == characterization of the lysogeny dna module from the temperate streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage phi sfi21.
AB  == phage phi sfi21, the only temperate streptococcus thermophilus phage from our phage collection, showed extensive dna homology with virulent phages from lytic group i. southern blot hybridizations demonstrated that the phi sfi21-specific dna was clustered in an approximately 6.6-kb-long region, the putative lysogeny module. sequence analysis and database research identified an integrase within this module; orf 203 with homology to an anonymous orf 258 from the temperate lactococcal phage bk5-t; orf 127 and orf 122 with weak homology to the n- and c-terminal parts, respectively, of the cl-like repressor from lactococcal phages  tuc2009 and bk5-t; orf 75 with homology to a repressor protein from lambdoid phage 434 and an anti-repressor ant with homology to phage p1. the molecular arrangement of the predicted orfs in phage phi sfi21 was very similar to that of  the lactococcal phage bk5-t. the transition from phi sfi21-specific dna into dna  shared with virulent phages was abrupt and flanked at one side by notable dna repeats. sequence analysis identified a holin protein to the left of the lysogeny module. a site-specific deletion of 2.4 kb, which reproducibly transformed phi sfi21 into a lytic phage, was localized in the lysogeny module. it was flanked at both sides by conspicuous dna repeats. one repeat region reflected the dna around the attp site, while the other reflected the putative genetic switch region between repressor and anti-repressor genes. s. thermophilus host sfi1 transformed with a plasmid containing int and orf 203 showed resistance to superinfection by  heterologous phages, but not by the homologous phi sfi21. part of the int gene could be deleted without loss of this activity, while a deletion in orf 203 resulted in loss of the phage resistance. we speculate on the possibility of a bipartite immunity system for the control of lysogeny in phi sfi21.

TI  == thermophilin 13, a nontypical antilisterial poration complex bacteriocin, that functions without a receptor.
AB  == a novel broad host range antimicrobial substance, thermophilin 13, has been isolated and purified from the growth medium of streptococcus thermophilus. thermophilin 13 is composed of the antibacterial peptide thma (mr of 5776) and the enhancing factor thmb (mr of 3910); the latter peptide increased the activity of thma approximately 40 x. both peptides are encoded by a single operon, and an  equimolar ratio was optimal for thermophilin 13 activity. despite the antilisterial activity of thermophilin 13, neither thma nor thmb contain the ygngv-c consensus sequence of listeria-active peptides, and post-translational modifications comparable to that in the lantibiotics are also absent. mass spectrometry did reveal the apparent oxidation of methionines in thma, which resulted in a peptide that could not be enhanced any longer by thmb, whereas the  intrinsic bactericidal activity was normal. thermophilin 13 dissipated the membrane potential and the ph gradient in liposomes, and this activity was independent of membrane components from a sensitive strain (e.g. lipid or proteinaceous receptor). models of possible poration complexes formed are proposed on the basis of sequence comparisons, structure predictions, and the functional analysis of thermophilin 13.

AB  == an endopeptidase gene (pepe) was isolated from a previously constructed genomic library of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32. the pepe gene consisted of a 1,314-bp open reading frame encoding a putative peptide of 52.1 kda. significant identity  was found between the deduced amino acid sequence of pepe and the sequences for aminopeptidase c from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis dsm7290, l. helveticus cnrz32, streptococcus thermophilus cnrz302, and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris am2. a recombinant pepe fusion protein containing an n-terminal six-histidine tag was constructed and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. characterization of pepe revealed that it was a thiol-dependent protease having a monomeric mass of 50 kda, with optimum temperature, nacl concentration, and ph for activity at 32 to 37 degrees c, 0.5%, and 4.5, respectively. pepe had significant activity under conditions which simulate those of ripening cheese (10 degrees c, 4% nacl, ph 5.1). pepe hydrolyzed internal peptide bonds in met-enkephalin and bradykinin; however, hydrolysis of alpha-, beta-, and kappa-caseins was not detected.

TI  == isolation and characterization of transcription signal sequences from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus (st) chromosomal dna fragments generated by partial sau3a digestion were cloned into the unique bamhi site upstream from the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene of the escherichia coli (ec)promoter-probe vector pkk520-3. recombinant plasmids containing st sequences  with transcription-activation activity were isolated from chloramphenicol-resistant (cmr) ec transformants. a promoterless streptomyces antibioticus melanin biosynthesis operon (melc) was inserted immediately downstream from the st sequence to identify dna with strong promoter activity. several st transcription-activation sequences, termed stps, were isolated and subcloned, and their nucleic acid sequences determined. the -10 and -35 consensus sequences were identified in these putative st promoters. detailed analysis of stp3306 sequence data revealed two partial open reading frames (orfs) with high degrees of homology to prokaryotic gtp-binding protein and dna repair enzyme, thus providing valuable information for further study on dna maintenance in this  important lactic acid bacterium.

AB  == spacer regions between the 16s and 23s rrna genes of different dairy and probiotic lactic acid bacteria were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with conserved primers and the nucleotide sequences of these spacer regions were determined. amplification/oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed for lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus and streptococcus thermophilus based on the differences in the nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s  rrna spacer regions. also a primer pair identifying both lb. paracasei and lb. rhamnosus was designed. in addition to conventional pcr in a heat block a rapid pcr method in an air thermocycler (atc) with glass capillaries was used.

TI  == primary and secondary structures of rrna spacer regions in enterococci.
AB  == the 16s-23s and 23s-5s rrna spacer dna regions (spacer regions 1 and 2, respectively) from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans and enterococcus mundtii were amplified by pcr. their  nucleotide sequences were established and a secondary structure model showing the interaction between the two spacer regions was built. whereas lactococci and streptococcus sensu stricto are characterized by a single type of spacer region 1, the enterococci show a high degree of variability in this region; thus the spacer regions 1 with and without trna(ala) were characterized. however, as shown for lactococci and streptococcus sensu stricto, the trna(ala) gene does not encode the 3'-terminal cca trinucleotide. a putative antitermination signal is found downstream from the trna(ala) gene. based on comparison with lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus, a double-stranded processing stem is proposed. in e, hirae, one of the three different types of spacer region 1 contains no trna(ala), but displays a 107 nt insertion that forms a long stem-loop structure. a similar insertion (115 nt in length) was found in e. faecium and base compensatory mutations preserve the ability to form the long stem-loop structure. such insertions may correspond to mobile intervening sequences, as found in the 23s rrna coding sequences of some gram-negative bacteria. the spacer regions 1 and 2 from the three subgroups of streptococci were compared, and except for the trna(ala) gene and the double-stranded processing sites, little similarity was found, which opens large possibilities for future development of dna-based typing methods.

TI  == analysis of the icsba locus required for biosynthesis of the inner core region from neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == by deletion mutagenesis in the entire meningococcal chromosome, we have previously identified the icsa gene, which encodes the glycosyltransferase required for adding glcnac to hep-ii in the inner core of meningococcal lps. this gene has homology to several lps glycosyltransferases, notably to rfak from salmonella typhimurium and bplh from bordetella pertussis, both of which encode glcnac transferases. directly upstream of icsa is an orf showing significant homology to the hypothetical protein hi0653 from the haemophilus influenzae genome sequence, and to a lesser degree to putative glycosyltransferases from streptococcus thermophilus and yersinia enterocolitica. insertional inactivation  of this orf resulted in a meningococcal strain with truncated lps. we have named  this new lps-involved gene icsb. differences in binding of monoclonal antibodies  and in mobility on tricine-sds-page showed that lps from icsa and icsb mutants is similar but not identical. on the basis of these results, we postulated that the  new gene encodes the glycosyltransferase required for adding glc to hep-i. structural analysis of purified mutant lps by electrospray mass spectrometry was  used to verify this hypothesis. the composition determined for icsa and icsb is lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2.pea and lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2.pea-glcnac, respectively. the icsa and icsb genes thus form an operon encoding the glycosyltransferases required for chain elongation from the lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2 basal structure, with icsa first adding glcnac to hep-ii and icsb subsequently adding glc to hep-i. only then is completion of the lacto-n-neotetraose structure possible through the action of the igta-e genes.

TI  == the cpsabcde genes involved in polysaccharide production in streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus strain ncbf 2393.
AB  == a 4074-bp ecori fragment of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (s. thermophilus) chromosomal dna containing genes involved in exocellular polysaccharide (eps) was identified and cloned. the nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined and found to contain one partial and four complete open reading frames. these were designated cpsa, cpsb, cpsc, cpsd and cpse and encoded proteins of > 130, 243, 230, 246 and 455 amino acids, respectively, that showed homology with the genes of the cps cluster, involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, in streptococcus pneumoniae type 19f. the cpsa gene is predicted to encode a transcriptional regulator, while cpsc and cpsd are predicted to encode proteins involved in polysaccharide polymerization and export. the cpse gene is likely to encode the phosphate-prenyl glycosyl-1-phosphate transferase catalyzing the first step in polysaccharide biosynthesis in s. thermophilus. southern blot analysis revealed that cpse is found only in polysaccharide producing strains of  s. thermophilus.

TI  == proline biosynthesis in streptococcus thermophilus: characterization of the proba operon and its products.
AB  == the presence of proline in the medium was not essential for growth of streptococcus thermophilus, indicating that there is a proline biosynthetic pathway in this organism. genetic and biochemical analysis identified and characterized this pathway. two genes, designated prob and proa, were cloned, sequenced and characterized. biochemical analysis of the prob- and proa-encoded enzymes showed that the proline biosynthetic pathway of s. thermophilus is similar to the one previously described in escherichia coli. the deduced amino acid sequence of a 2-408 kb dna region containing the genes revealed the similarity of the s. thermophilus gene products to prob and proa of e. coli and serratia marcescens, and to the corresponding n- and c-terminal domains of the bifunctional plant enzyme delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase of vigna aconitifolia. northern blot analysis showed that the two genes in s. thermophilus are organized in a single operon with prob proximal and proa distal to the promoter; primer extension analysis indicated that proba transcription is not under repressive control by exogenously supplied proline.

TI  == characterization of a mosaic iss1 element and evidence for the recent horizontal  transfer of two different types of iss1 between streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a 12-kb region of the streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 chromosome was found to  contain two copies of is981 (one complete and one truncated) and three copies of  iss1 (two complete, iss1sa and iss1sc, and one truncated, delta iss1sb). comparison of the nucleotide sequences of these iss1 elements with those of previously identified iso-iss1 elements from lactococcus lactis and the enterococcus genus indicated that the iss1 group is divided into three distinct subgroups which we have named alpha, beta and gamma. nucleotide sequences of elements belonging to the same subgroup share more than 97% identity whereas sequences of elements from different groups share only 75-85% identity. sequence  analysis of iss1sa and delta iss1sb showed that they are members of the alpha group. we found that iss1sc from s. themophilus cnrz368, an iss1 from l. lactis il964 and is946 from l. lactis tek1 resulted from recombinations between alpha and beta elements. in addition, iss1w from l. lactis wg2 resulted from a recombination event between a gamma element and an iss1 belonging to an unidentified subgroup. iss1 sequences belonging to the alpha and beta subgroups were found in both s. thermophilus and l. lactis and gamma sequences were found in both the enterococcus genus and l. lactis. the quasi-identity of some iss1 elements in s. thermophilus and l. lactis and the distribution of alpha and beta  elements suggest that horizontal transfer of iss1 elements recently took place from l. lactis to s. thermophilus, two lactic acid bacteria used in the manufacture of cheeses. since the presence of is981 in s. thermophilus cnrz368 also probably resulted from a horizontal transfer from l. lactis [guedon et al. (1995) mol. microbiol. 16, 69-78], the 12-kb region bearing is981 and iss1 elements could be due to the integration of a lactococcal dna fragment into the chromosome.

TI  == the gale gene encoding the udp-galactose 4-epimerase of brevibacterium lactofermentum is coupled transcriptionally to the dmdr gene.
AB  == the gale gene of brevibacterium lactofermentum, encoding udp-galactose 4-epimerase (ec 5.1.3.2), has been identified by dna sequencing downstream from the orf1-sigb-dmdr region. the arrangement of the sigb-dtxr-gale cluster is also  conserved in corynebacterium diphtheriae. the deduced gale product was a protein  of 329 aa residues (35.4 kda) that shared a high degree of identity to known udp-galactose 4-epimerase proteins from gram-positive microorganisms (streptomyces lividans and streptococcus thermophilus). transcriptional analysis  of the dmdr and gale genes in nutrient-rich medium showed that these genes are part of an operon, that is actively transcribed as a bicistronic mrna during the  exponential growth phase, but transcription of the operon is decreased during the stationary growth phase. in addition, the dmdr gene was also expressed as a monocistronic 0.7-kb transcript during the active growth phase.

TI  == disruption of the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 2b (pbp2b) causes altered cell morphology and cease in exopolysaccharide production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6.
AB  == genetic and biochemical analysis of exopolysaccharide (eps) production in lactic  acid bacteria has been a growing field of interest in the food industry. we previously identified and characterized a gene cluster composed of 13 genes (epsa to epsm) responsible for eps production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6. here  we report one further gene, pbp2b, that is connected to eps production. mutants with a gene disruption in pbp2b were no longer able to produce eps, exhibited a reduced growth-rate, and their cell morphology was altered. the predicted gene product showed significant homology to the class b penicillin-binding proteins 2b of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. upstream of pbp2b, we further identified two genes which showed significant homology to the e. coli fold and urfl, which is an unidentified open reading frame presumed to be involved in dna repair. downstream of pbp2b, we identified a gene that showed homology to the bacillus subtilis and  the escherichia coli recm or recr which, respectively, are involved in the methyl-dependent dna mismatch repair. in s. thermophilus, pbp2b and recm were transcribed from their own promoters as monocistronic mrnas and are therefore organized as independent transcriptional units.

TI  == genomic organization of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == current knowledge of the genomes of the lactic acid bacteria, lactococcus lactis  and streptococcus thermophilus, and members of the genera lactobacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus and carnobacterium, is reviewed. the genomes contain a chromosome within the size range of 1.8 to 3.4 mbp. plasmids are common in lactococcus lactis (most strains carry 4-7 different plasmids), some of the lactobacilli and pediococci, but they are not frequently present in s. thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or the intestinal lactobacilli. five is elements have been found in l. lactis and most strains carry multiple copies of at least two of them; some strains also carry a 68-kbp conjugative transposon. is elements have been found in the genera lactobacillus and leuconostoc, but not in s. thermophilus. prophages are also a normal component of the l. lactis genome and lysogeny is common in the lactobacilli, however it appears to be rare in s. thermophilus. physical and genetic maps for two l. lactis subsp. lactis strains, two l. lactis subsp. cremoris strains and s. thermophilus a054 have been constructed and each reveals the presence of six rrn  operons clustered in less than 40% of the chromosome. the l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363 map contains 115 genetic loci and the s. thermophilus map has 35. the maps indicate significant plasticity in the l. lactis subsp. cremoris chromosome in the form of a number of inversions and translocations. the cause(s) of these rearrangements is (are) not known. a number of potentially powerful genetic tools designed to analyse the l. lactis genome have been constructed in recent years. these tools enable gene inactivation, gene replacement and gene recovery experiments to be readily carried out with this organism, and potentially with other lactic acid bacteria and gram-positive bacteria. integration vectors based on temperate phage attb sites and the random insertion  of is elements have also been developed for l. lactis and the intestinal lactobacilli. in addition, a l. lactis sex factor that mobilizes the chromosome in a manner reminiscent to that seen with escherichia coli hfr strains has been discovered and characterized. with the availability of this new technology, research into the genome of the lactic acid bacteria is poised to undertake a period of extremely rapid information accrual.

TI  == gene for aspartate racemase from the sulfur-dependent hyperthermophilic archaeum, desulfurococcus strain sy.
AB  == amino acid racemases are ubiquitous throughout eubacteria. however, no amino acid racemases have yet been found in eukaryotes and archaea. we cloned a gene highly  homologous to that for the aspartate racemase from the sulfur-dependent hyperthermophilic archaeum, desulfurococcus strain sy. the product of the gene showed 35.2% amino acid sequence identity with the aspartate racemase of streptococcus thermophilus iam10064, and was also homologous to glutamate racemases around the putative catalytic cysteine residues. the encoded protein was expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant protein had amino acid racemizing activity, which was highly specific for aspartate and increased with temperature from 37 degrees c to 90 degrees c. therefore, this was identified as  the first hyperthermophilic archaeal amino acid racemase. a little aspartate racemizing activity was also detected in the crude extract of desulfurococcus strain sy. the function of this aspartate racemase might be the uptake of -aspartate formed at high temperature or the production of -aspartate as a cell component. the fact that the amino acid racemases are distributed among both eubacteria and archaea suggests that endogenous -amino acids in mammals are also  synthesized by amino acid racemases.

AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus was cultivated in a chemostat in order to obtain an adhesive phenotype of this strain. when the system was operated at low dilution rates (d < 0.2 h-1) for about 4 weeks, the strain formed a visible film on the surface of the culture vessel. the biofilm cells were not washed out even when dilution rates were increased (d = 6.9 h-1), and this resulted in a high biomass productivity (p = 4.1 g1(-1) h-1). on the other hand,  when the culture was grown at dilution rates faster than 0.2 h-1, only the free suspended cells were present in the culture broth, and were washed out at velocities of about 1.0 h-1. the biomass productivity was consequently lower (p = 1.33 g1(-1) h-1) than in the previous case. the selected adhesive phenotype was grown on different glass beads and the possibility of lactate fermentation in a continuous and semicontinuous mode was demonstrated.

AB  == the lactose transport protein (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus was amplified  to levels as high as 8 and 30% of total membrane protein in escherichia coli and  s. thermophilus, respectively. in both organisms the protein was functional and the expression levels were highest with the streptococcal lacs promoter. also a lacs deletion mutant, lacking the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain, could be amplified to levels >20% of membrane protein. membranes from s. thermophilus proved to be superior in terms of efficient solubilization and ease and extent of purification of lacs; >95% of lacs was solubilized with relatively low concentrations of triton x-100, n-octyl-beta-d-glucoside, n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside, or c12e8. the lacs protein carrying a poly-histidine  tag was purified in large quantities (approximately 5 mg/liter of culture) and with a purity >98% in a two-step process involving nickel chelate affinity and anion exchange chromatography. the membrane reconstitution of lacs was studied systematically by stepwise solubilization of preformed liposomes, prepared from e. coli phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine, and protein incorporation at the different stages of liposome solubilization. the detergents were removed by adsorption onto polystyrene beads and h+-lactose symport and lactose counterflow  were measured. highest transport activities were obtained when triton x-100 was used throughout the solubilization/purification procedure, whereas activity was lost irreversibly with n-octyl-beta-d-glucoside. for reconstitutions mediated by  n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside, c12e8, and to a lesser extent triton x-100, the highest transport activities were obtained when the liposomes were titrated with  low amounts of detergent (onset of liposome solubilization). importantly, under these conditions proteoliposomes were obtained in which lacs was reconstituted in an inside-out orientation, as suggested by the outside labeling of a single cysteine mutant with a membrane impermeable biotin-maleimide. the results are consistent with a mechanism of reconstitution in which the hydrophilic regions of lacs prevent a random insertion of the protein into the membrane. consistent with the in vivo lactose/galactose exchange catalyzed by the lacs protein, the maximal rate of lactose counterflow was almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of  h+-lactose symport.

TI  == the lactose transporter in leuconostoc lactis is a new member of the lacs subfamily of galactoside-pentose-hexuronide translocators.
AB  == the gene encoding the lactose transport protein (lacs) of leuconostoc lactis nz6009 has been cloned from its native lactose plasmid, pnz63, by functional complementation of lactose permease-deficient escherichia coli mutants. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame with the capacity to  encode a protein of 639 amino acids which had limited but significant identity to the lactose transport carriers (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus (34.5%) and lactobacillus bulgaricus (35.6%). this similarity was present both in the amino-terminal hydrophobic carrier domain, which is homologous to the e. coli melibiose transporter, and in the carboxy-terminal enzyme iia-like regulatory domain. the flanking regions of dna surrounding lacs were also sequenced. preceding the lacs gene was a small open reading frame in the same orientation encoding a deduced 95-amino-acid protein with a sequence similar to the amino-terminal portion of beta-galactosidase i from bacillus stearothermophilus.  the lacs gene was separated from the downstream beta-galactosidase genes (laclm)  by 2 kb of dna containing an is3-like insertion sequence, which is a novel arrangement for lac genes in comparison with that in other lactic acid bacteria.  the lacs gene was cloned in an e. coli-streptococcus shuttle vector and was expressed both in a lacs deletion derivative of s. thermophilus and in a pnz63-cured strain, l. lactis nz6091. the role of the lacs protein was confirmed  by uptake assays in which substantial uptake of radiolabeled lactose or galactose was observed with l. lactis or s. thermophilus plasmids harboring an intact lacs  gene. furthermore, galactose uptake was observed in nz6091, suggesting the presence of at least one more transport system for galactose in l. lactis.

AB  == site-specific spontaneous deletions were observed with high frequency in three regions of the genome of the temperate streptococcus thermophilus phage phi sfi21. deletion sizes were 750 bp (type 1), 2.7 kb (type 2), and 1 kb (type 3). combinations of types 1 and 3 and 2 and 3 were observed. the mutants grew lytically although with reduced burst sizes. type 2 mutants lost the capacity to  lysogenize host cells. upon serial passage, the deletion mutants overgrew the wild-type phage. no direct or inverted dna repeats were associated with type 1 or 2 deletion sites. several independent phage isolates showed deletions at identical nucleotide positions, suggesting a site-specific recombination system.  sequencing of an xbal restriction fragment covering the type 1 deletion predicted a single long open reading frame (orf) showing a high degree of amino acid similarity with two proteins from bacteriophage p1 implicated in its immunity control (kiia, ant). type 1 deletion leads to a loss of the conserved c-terminal  part of this orf.

TI  == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

TI  == development and characterization of lactose-positive pediococcus species for milk fermentation.
AB  == bacteriophages against streptococcus thermophilus are a growing problem in the italian cheese industry. one possible control method involves replacing s. thermophilus in mozzarella starter blends with lactic acid bacteria from a different genus or species. in this study, we evaluated lactose-positive pediococci for this application. because we could not identify any commercially available pediococci with fast acid-producing ability in milk, we transformed pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 25744, p. pentosaceus atcc 25745, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 12697 by electroporation with ppn-1, a 35-kb lactococcus lactis lactose plasmid. transformants of p. pentosaceus atcc 25745 and p. acidilactici atcc 12697 were then used to examine lactose-positive pediococci for properties related to milk fermentation. both transformants rapidly produced acid and efficiently retained ppn-1 in lactose broth, and neither bacterium was attacked by bacteriophages in whey collected from commercial cheese facilities. paired starter combinations of pediococcus spp. and lactobacillus helveticus lh100 exhibited synergistic ph reduction in milk, and small-scale cheese trials showed  that these cultures could be used to manufacture part-skim mozzarella cheese. results demonstrate that lactose-positive pediococci have potential as replacement cocci for s. thermophilus in italian cheese starter blends and may facilitate development of new strain rotation schemes to combat s. thermophilus bacteriophage problems in mozzarella cheese plants.

TI  == cation and sugar selectivity determinants in a novel family of transport proteins.
AB  == a new family of homologous membrane proteins that transport galactosides-pentoses-hexuronides (gph) is described. by analysing the aligned amino acid sequences of the gph family, and by exploiting their different specificities for cations and sugars, we have designed mutations that yield novel insights into the nature of ligand binding sites in membrane proteins. mutants have been isolated/constructed in the melibiose transport proteins of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium, and the lactose transport protein of streptococcus thermophilus which facilitate uncoupled transport or have an altered cation and/or substrate specificity. most of the mutations map in the amino-terminal region, in or near amphipathic alpha-helices ii and iv, or in  interhelix-loop 10-11 of the transport proteins. on the basis of the kinetic properties of these mutants, and the primary and secondary structure analyses presented here, we speculate on the cation binding pocket of this family of transporters. the regulation of the transporters through interaction with, or phosphorylation by, components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system is also discussed.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and analysis of pwc1, a pc194-type rolling circle replicon in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pfx3 (rolling circle, pe194-type) or pci305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. the plasmid, pwc1, was compatible with both pci3340 (a pci305 derivative) and pfx3 in l. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. sequence analysis of pwc1 showed one major orf encoding a protein with a deduced  size of 316 amino acids (aa). database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pfx- and pci-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pc194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. a pc194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in l. lactis. further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pwc1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. the chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pc194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pwc1 to give pcp12. the host range of pcp12 included streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus, but not escherichia coli. both pcp12 and to a lesser extent pwc1 generated single-stranded dna (ssdna) in l. lactis. a possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pwc1 and by comparing levels of ssdna produced by pcp12 deletion derivatives. the pwc1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.

TI  == identification and characterization of the eps (exopolysaccharide) gene cluster from streptococcus thermophilus sfi6.
AB  == we report the identification and characterization of the eps gene cluster of streptococcus thermophilus sfi6 required for exopolysaccharide (eps) synthesis. this report is the first genetic work concerning eps production in a food microorganism. the eps secreted by this strain consists of the following tetrasaccharide repeating unit:-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->3)-[alpha-d-galp-(1-->6)]-beta-d- d-galp-(1-->3)-alpha-d-galp-d-galpnac-(1-->. the genetic locus the genetic locus  was identified by tn916 mutagenesis in combination with a plate assay to identify eps mutants. sequence analysis of the gene region, which was obtained from subclones of a genomic library of sfi6, revealed a 15.25-kb region encoding 15 open reading frames. eps expression in the non-eps-producing heterologous host, lactococcus lactis mg1363, showed that within the 15.25-kb region, a region with  a size of 14.52 kb encoding the 13 genes epsa to epsm was capable of directing eps synthesis and secretion in this host. homology searches of the predicted proteins in the swiss-prot database revealed high homology (40 to 68% identity) for epsa, b, c, d, and e and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus agalactiae. moderate to low homology (37 to 18% identity) was detected for epsb, d, f, and h and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in staphylococcus aureus for epsc, d, and e and the genes involved in exopolysaccharide i (epsi) synthesis in rhizobium meliloti for epsc to epsj and the genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis in members of the  enterobacteriaceae, and finally for eps k and lipb of neisseria meningitidis. genes (epsj, epsl, and epsm) for which the predicted proteins showed little or no homology with proteins in the swiss-prot database were shown to be involved in eps synthesis by single-crossover gene disruption experiments.

TI  == antimutagenicity of yogurt.
AB  == yogurt is milk fermented by a mixture of two bacteria: lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. epidemiological studies have correlated a reduced risk of colon cancer with yogurt consumption. independent studies have established that yogurt and extracts thereof are antimutagenic. although multiple explanations can account for yogurt's putative anticarcinogenicity, we are interested in testing the hypothesis that antimutagenic compounds produced during fermentation are responsible. we recently reported on the antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt against the experimental carcinogens n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) and 3.2'dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (dmab) (mutation res. (1995) 334, 213-224). we are now aware that palmitic acid is an active ingredient against mnng.

TI  == efficient insertional mutagenesis in lactococci and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == in lactococci, the study of chromosomal genes and their regulation is limited by  the lack of an efficient transposon mutagenesis system. we associated the insertion sequence iss1 with the thermosensitive replicon pg+ host to generate a  mutagenic tool that can be used even in poorly transformable strains. iss1 transposition is random in different lactococcal strains as well as in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus thermophilus. high-frequency random insertion (of about 1%) obtained with this system in lactococcus lactis allows efficient mutagenesis, with typically one insertion per cell. after iss1 replicative transposition, the chromosome contains duplicated iss1 sequences flanking pg+ host. this structure allows cloning of the interrupted gene. in addition, efficient excision of the plasmid leaves a single iss1 copy at the mutated site, thus generating a stable mutant strain with no foreign markers. mutants obtained by this transposition system are food grade and can thus be used in fermentation processes.

TI  == development of an expression strategy using a lytic phage to trigger explosive plasmid amplification and gene expression.
AB  == a novel plasmid-based expression strategy, exploiting two features of lytic bacteriophages, was developed in lactococcus lactis. components of this system include a phage origin of replication and phage expression signals, which were induced to high efficiency upon phage infection of the host. phage-specific expression signals were cloned from phi 31 in a promoter-screening strategy using the lacz gene from streptococcus thermophilus. one clone exhibited a significant  induction in beta-galactosidase production and concomitant increase in lacz mrna  during the phi 31 infection cycle of the host. molecular characterization of the  cloned insert revealed 888 bp positioned near the phi 31 cos site. primer extension analysis showed that transcription was induced approximately 20 min following phi 31 infection at four points, apparently organized in two sets of tandem promoters on the cloned phage insert. one of these middle phage promoters  also showed a basal level of activity prior to phage infection. the phi 31 promoter lacz cassette was cloned into a low-copy-number vector plasmid containing the phi 31 origin of replication (ori31) and the resulting low-copy-number plasmid exhibited negligible beta-galactosidase production in l.  lactis. however, > 2,000 units were detected following a deliberate infection with phi 31. a control expression plasmid without ori31 could only be induced to  85 units. the combination of these phage-inducible expression signals together with ori31 functioned synergistically to drive rapid and high efficiency expression of a heterologous gene in l. lactis.

TI  == lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of  the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt  p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings  before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus  on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.

TI  == role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  == the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained  microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in  the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased  by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus  was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.

AB  == trophic effects of milk fermented with lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, bifidobacterium sp., or the combination of lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus (yogurt) were studied on  the iec-6 intestinal epithelial cell line. incorporation of [methyl-3h]thymidine, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activities, cyclic amp production, and differentiation of levels of the iec-6 strain were evaluated between the 15th and 30th passage in culture. all fermented and unfermented milks enhanced trophic responses of iec-6 cells in a dose-dependent manner. compared with the corresponding milks, supernatant fractions were more effective in stimulating mitochondrial dehydrogenase response. fermented milk supernatants were also more  effective than the corresponding unfermented fractions. increases in dna synthesis and cyclic amp confirmed the activation observed with mitochondrial dehydrogenase. yogurt induced the more trophic response with an increased number  of the more differentiated cell morphotype. fermentation with l. casei also demonstrated an important trophic adaptation of iec-6 cells. milk processing by lactic acid bacteria enhanced trophic and proliferation responses of intestinal epithelial cell line iec-6. these results suggested that iec-6 cells could represent an accurate and easy in vitro model for testing the trophic quality of  various nutrients and for an optimization of physiological digestive functions.

TI  == highly bioluminescent streptococcus thermophilus strain for the detection of diary-relevant antibiotics in milk.
AB  == inefficient translational initiation is often the cause of poor foreign gene expression in gram-positive organisms. the expression of bacterial luciferase (lux) genes in streptococcus thermophilus (bioluminescence) was improved by addressing this problem in two ways; by ribosome-binding site (rbs) replacement,  and by enhancing lux rbs access by polymerase chain reaction modification either  alone or combined with translational coupling to a truncated upstream open- reading frame (orf') having its own rbs. lactococcal expression signals were employed for plasmid-based lux expression. the same constructs were used to monitor bioluminescence in lactococcus lactis, as well as two non-lactic bacterial strains, for comparison. high lux expression was achieved in all four organisms with a heterodimeric thermostable enzyme. surprisingly, where ready access to the lux rbs was predicted, translational coupling to the lactococcal orf remained a prerequisite for detectable lux expression in l. lactis. in contrast, high bioluminescence in s. thermophilus was independent of coupling. consistent with these observations, inspection of published gene sequences suggests that rbs "strength" may be a more important factor in translation in s.  thermophilus than in l. lactis. using reduced light production in highly bioluminescent s. thermophilus as an indicator of biocide presence in milk, test  times could be significantly shortened compared with a commercial test utilizing  the related non-bioluminescent strain. lux genes appear to be sensitive, exponential-phase reporters of gene activity in s. thermophilus, an organism with molecular biology and genetics that remain largely unstudied.

AB  == it is generally agreed that the population of lactic acid bacteria in yogurt must be not less than 10(6) ufc/g. viability of the lactic flora until the end of shelf-life is affected for many factors, which has incidence in the recuperability of this microflora. mrs and lee agar were selected for the total count of lactic bacteria, the m17 was used for the s salivarius ssp thermophilus  and the rca for l. delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus. different methodologies were used  for detection and enumeration of this bacteria: direct plate count; thermal treatment and recuperation of the injured cells in soy tripticase broth. the enumeration was done at time zero and 3 hours after the start of the fermentative process and during storage at 4, 12 and 21 days. the results shown an excellent recuperability of the lactic flora in the selected media and methods that were used: however the enumeration was significatively lower in the rca agar. the counts in the lee agar shown a better recuperability. the thermal treatment affected negatively the counts of lactic flora and the repair method shown better results in the yogurt sample during storage. ph and acidity were determined at the beginning and during the storage period. it was observed a ph decrease because of the lactic acid production at the end of shelf-life.

TI  == amino acid requirements and peptidase activities of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  == the aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between amino acid requirements and peptidase enzyme systems in three streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains. a synthetic medium without nitrogen components and a milk (rd milk) without its non-protein nitrogen fraction were prepared with different mixtures of amino acids. the strains showed different amino acid requirements. some amino acids proved to be essential, some were required, while  others did not affect growth. in the synthetic medium, only leucine and glutamic  acid were essential for growth. in rd milk, the amino acid requirements were found to be lower, with only the absence of glutamic acid causing complete inhibition of growth. relationships between aminopeptidase activities of the strains and their amino acid requirements were observed. strains with higher amino acid requirements were also found to express a wider range of peptidases.

TI  == effect of milks inoculated with lactobacillus acidophilus or a yogurt starter culture in lactose-maldigesting children.
AB  == dairy products containing live bacteria that possess lactase activity are used for dietary management of lactose maldigestion. the efficacy of acidophilus milk  and the effect of consuming unfermented milk that had been inoculated with yogurt bacteria have not been examined in children. we compared scores for breath h2 excretion and symptoms of 20 lactose-maldigesting children following ingestion of 250 ml of uninoculated milk with two identical milks inoculated with 10(10) cells of lactobacillus acidophilus or with a commercial yogurt starter culture containing 10(8) cells of lactobacillus lactis and 10(10) cells of streptococcus  thermophilus. nine of 10 subjects who were symptomatic following ingestion of uninoculated milk experienced a reduction in symptoms following ingestion of milk inoculated with l. acidophilus, without a decline in h2 excretion. five of 6 subjects who were symptomatic following uninoculated milk had decreased symptoms  and a significant reduction in h2 excretion following milk inoculated with the yogurt culture. for lactose-maldigesting children, milks inoculated with l. acidophilus or with a yogurt culture were associated with decreased symptoms compared with those with uninoculated milk.

TI  == effect of a fermented infant formula containing viable bifidobacteria on the fecal flora composition and ph of healthy full-term infants.
AB  == we assessed the growth, tolerance, and acceptability as well as fecal flora composition and stool ph of 20 healthy full-term infants fed with a fermented whey-adapted infant formula containing viable bifidobacteria (10(6)/g of powder)  during the first 2 months of life. this fermented infant formula, first biologically acidified by streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus, was compared to a whey-adapted, nonacidified, low-phosphate infant formula in a double-blind, randomized controlled study. the results were compared to a control group (n = 14) of fully breast-fed infants. the fermented whey-adapted formula containing viable bifidobacteria induced a prevalence of colonization with bifidobacteria at 1 month of age similar to that of breast-fed  infants (12/20 versus 8/14) but significantly higher than in the group fed the standard infant formula (4/20). the mean bacterial count of bifidobacteria was similar in all colonized infants; however, fecal ph was significantly lower in the breast-fed infants than in the nonacidified bottle-fed infants. this kind of  infant formula was well tolerated and promoted a normal growth during the first 2 months.

TI  == regulation of glycerol and maltose uptake by the iiaglc-like domain of iinag of the phosphotransferase system in salmonella typhimurium lt2.
AB  == in enterobacteriaceae the nonphosphorylated form of iiaglc of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (pts) can inhibit the uptake and subsequent metabolism of glycerol and maltose by binding to, and inhibiting, glycerol kinase and the malk protein of the maltose transport system, respectively. in this report we show that the iiaglc-like domain of the membrane-bound iin-acetylglucosamine (iinag) of the pts can replace iiaglc in a salmonella typhimurium crr mutant strain that lacks all soluble iiaglc. the inhibition was most severe in cells which were partially induced for the glycerol or maltose uptake systems. the streptococcus thermophilus lactose transporter lacs, which also contains a iiaglc-like domain, could not replace iiaglc. neither iinag nor lacs could replace iiaglc in activation of adenylate cyclase.

AB  == streptococcus thermophilus (st) chromosomal dna (chr dna) fragments having promoter activity were cloned and selected in escherichia coli using a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase- (cat-) based promoter-probe vector pkk520-3. insertion of a promoterless streptomycete melanin biosynthesis operon (melc) downstream from the promoters of the library further identified clone stp2201 as  a strong promoter in e. coli. subcloning of a stp2201-melc dna fragment into the  pmeu-series s. thermophilus-e. coli shuttle vectors yielded peu5xml2201x plasmids that conferred mel+ phenotype to e. coli. the peu5aml2201a was further shown to afford a high level of tyrosinase pro-anti-tyrosinase antiserum in s. thermophilus. substituting melc with a streptomycete cholesterol oxidase gene (choa) in the same orientation yielded peu5ach2201a that conferred choa activity  to an e. coli transformant at a level of (1.06 +/- 0.15) x 10(-7) units mg-1 protein. introduction of this plasmid into s. thermophilus by electrotransformation yielded choa+ transformant that produced the enzyme at about 25% of the level found in e. coli.

TI  == [antimutagenic action of bacterial culture liquid on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in salmonella typhimurium strains].
AB  == it was shown that cell extracts and cells of streptococcus faecalis decrease the  mutagenic effect of 2-nitrofluorene in salmonella typhimurium strain ta1538 by 73 and 48%, respectively. cell extracts and cells of bifidobacterium bifidum and propionibacterium shermanii exhibited weak antimutagenic activity. no antimutagenic effect was found in escherichia coli ab1157, lactobacillus delbrueckii, or streptococcus thermophilus. antimutageneicity of the cell extract of str. faecalis is both associated with extracellular factors interacting with 2-nitrofluorene (desmutagenesis) and with factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagen biotransformation and mutation induction. thiol compounds produced by growing str. faecalis may be desmutagenic factors. a relatively heat-stable substance or substances of a peptide nature with a mm less than 12 kda are antimutagenic factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagenesis.

TI  == kinetic analysis of lactose and proton coupling in glu379 mutants of the lactose  transport protein of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the role of glu379 in the lactose-h+ symport protein (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus was studied by analyzing the kinetic mechanism of transport of wild-type and ala379, asp379, and gln379 mutant proteins. glu379 forms part of the sequence motif lys-x-x-his-x-x-glu that is present in a number of sugar transport proteins, including lacy of escherichia coli. the e379a and e379q mutants were defective in the uptake of lactose against a concentration gradient  and lactose-dependent proton uptake, but catalyzed facilitated influx of lactose  down a concentration gradient and equilibrium exchange with rates similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. the e379d mutant was partially defective in the coupled  transport of lactose and protons. these results suggest that an acidic residue at position 379 is required for the coupled uptake of lactose and protons and are consistent with a mechanism in which lactose transport in the e379a and e379q mutants occurs by uniport rather than proton symport. lactose efflux down a concentration gradient in wild-type lacs and lacs-e379d increased with ph with apparent pk (pka) values of > or = 8.5 and 8.0, respectively, whereas efflux in the e379q mutant increased sigmoidally with a pka of about 6.0. imposition of an  artificial membrane potential (inside negative) in membrane vesicles bearing wild-type lacs or lacs-e379q not only inhibited the lactose efflux mediated by wild-type but also that of the mutant enzyme. to associate the role of glu379 with specific step(s) in the translocation cycle of lacs, the properties of wild-type lacs and the glu379 mutants have been evaluated by numerical analysis of simple kinetic schemes for translocation catalysis by solute h+ symport proteins. the properties of the wild-type enzyme are consistent with a mechanism  in which the order of ligand binding on the inside is substrate first and proton  last, whereas the order is random (or proton first, substrate last) at the outer  surface of the membrane. the wild-type enzyme is asymmetric with regard to proton binding; the pk for proton binding on the outside is at least 4 units higher than the pk on the inside. the properties of the glu379 mutants correspond with a lowering of the pk on the outside (pkout approximately pkin), and the induction of a leak pathway in which the binary enzyme-substrate complex becomes mobile.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the galactokinase gene from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the objective of this research was to clone and characterize the galactokinase gene (galk) from streptococcus thermophilus f410. partially digested genomic dna  was cloned into pbr322 and transformed into galk escherichia coli, and a galactose-fermenting transformant was isolated. restriction analysis revealed that the transformant resulted from a sau3a-hindiii 4.0-kb fragment. galactokinase activity in the recombinant was 10 times that of the parent strain. analysis of the dna sequence showed the presence of a 1.3-kb open reading frame that had high homology with the galk gene from other organisms. a putative ribosome-binding site, start and stop codons, and -10 and -35 sequences were identified. the predicted protein had a molecular mass of 49 kda, which corresponded to the estimated size of a band apparent by sds-page. amino acid sequence homologies with other galactokinases ranged from 50 to 62% similarity. northern blots were performed between the galk gene and mrna from s. thermophilus. no hybridization signals were observed for cells grown in glucose,  but cells grown in lactose or galactose gave moderate and strong signals. the results suggest that repression of the galk gene by glucose may be responsible for the galactose-releasing phenotype in these strains.

TI  == expression of cho and melc operons by a streptococcus thermophilus synthetic promoter in escherichia coli.
AB  == a 63-base-pair synthetic promoter, sp1, was synthesized on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of a putative streptococcus thermophilus promoter. when inserted upstream from the streptomyces cho operon in a recombinant plasmid, puco195p-36, sp1 activated the expression of the cho genes in escherichia coli, as shown by the production of cholesterol oxidase by the transformants. the sp1-driven cholesterol oxidase production in puco195p-36-transformed cells was estimated to be 40% of that produced by p(lac)-mediated cho expression in a puco193-containing host. the recombinant puco195p-36 appeared to be segregationally less stable in e. coli dh5 alpha than in hb101. its non-expressing counterpart, puco195p-1, was stable in both e. coli strains. the activity of sp1 was further demonstrated in e. coli by the expression of a streptomyces melc operon. when placed upstream from the test operon in the pmcu22apa construct, sp1 activated the melc expression as shown by the production of tyrosinase at (3.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(-3) u/mg and (16.0 +/- 1.0) x 10(-3) u/mg protein equivalent of cell extract in the absence and presence of isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside, respectively. the presence of a counter-oriented p(lac) at the 3' end of the operon in the pmcu22bpa plasmid reduced the sp1-mediated tyrosinase production by about 85%.

TI  == characterization and distribution of two insertion sequences, is1191 and iso-is981, in streptococcus thermophilus: does intergeneric transfer of insertion sequences occur in lactic acid bacteria co-cultures?
AB  == a chromosomal repeated sequence from streptococcus thermophilus was identified as a new insertion sequence (is), is1191. this is the first is element characterized in this species. this 1313 bp element has 28 bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats and is flanked by short direct repeats of 8 bp. the single large open reading frame of is1191 encodes a 391-amino-acid protein which displays homologies with transposases encodes by is1201 from lactobacillus helveticus (44.5% amino-acid sequence identity) and by the other iss of the is256 family. one of the copies of is1191 is inserted into a truncated iso-is981 element. the nucleotide sequences of two truncated iso-is981s from s. thermophilus and the sequence of is981 element from lactococcus lactis share more than 99% identity. the distribution of these insertion sequences in l. lactis and s. thermophilus strains suggests that intergeneric transfers occur during cocultures used in the  manufacture of cheese.

AB  == epidemiological and in vivo and in vitro experimental studies have suggested that fermented milks may interfere with the emergence and/or the development of colon  cancer. the results, however, remain inconclusive. this prompted us to develop a  new approach based on the use of ht-29, a cultured human colon cancer cell line,  to study at the cellular level the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer cell growth and differentiation characteristics. undifferentiated ht-29 cells have been grown in the continuous presence of milks fermented by one of the following  bacterial populations: lactobacillus helveticus, bifidobacterium, l.acidophilus or a mix of streptococcus thermophilus and l. bulgaricus. penicillin g was added  to the cell culture medium, resulting in a complete blockade of bacterial growth  without significant effect on bacterial viability. one out of the four bacteria species studied, namely l.acidophilus, was without effect on both cell growth and differentiation. the three other bacterial strains induced a significant, although variable, reduction in the growth rate of ht-29 cells, which resulted in a 10-50% decrease in the cell number at steady-state (i.e. at cell confluency). the most efficient strains in lowering the ht-29 growth rate were l. helveticus and bifidobacterium. concomitantly, the specific activities of dipeptidyl peptidase iv (dpp iv), a sensitive and specific marker of ht-29 cell differentiation, and that of three other brush border enzymes (sucrase, aminopeptidase n and alkaline phosphatase) were significantly increased, thus suggesting that these cells may have entered a differentiation process. altogether, these results indicate that the use of cultured colon cancer cells may be a useful tool to further study the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer and that bacterial strains may exert a different and specific effect on cancer cell growth and differentiation when used in fermented milk products.

TI  == regulation of bacterial sugar-h+ symport by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent enzyme  i/hpr-mediated phosphorylation.
AB  == the lactose-h+ symport protein (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus has a c-terminal hydrophilic domain that is homologous to iia protein(s) domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts). c-terminal truncation  mutants were constructed and expressed in escherichia coli and their properties were analyzed. remarkably, the entire iia domain (160 amino acids) could be deleted without significant effect on lactose-h+ symport and galactoside equilibrium exchange. analysis of the lacs mutants in s. thermophilus cells suggested that transport is affected by pts-mediated phosphorylation of the iia domain. for further studies, membrane vesicles of s. thermophilus were fused with cytochrome c oxidase-containing liposomes, and, when appropriate, phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) plus purified enzyme i and heat-stable protein hpr were incorporated into the hybrid membranes. generation of a protonmotive force (delta p) in the hybrid membranes resulted in accumulation of lactose, whereas uptake of the pts sugar sucrose was not observed. with pep and the energy-coupling proteins enzyme i and hpr of the pts on the inside, high rates of sucrose uptake were observed, whereas delta p-driven lactose uptake by wild-type lacs was inhibited.  this inhibition was not observed with lacs(delta 160) and lacs(h552r), indicating that pep-dependent enzyme i/hpr-mediated phosphorylation of the iia domain (possibly the conserved his-552 residue) modulates lactose-h+ symport activity.

AB  == the influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity and the cellular integrity of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus were tested. two strains (os 1 and os 2) of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and three strains (hc 15, 17, and 18) of s. salivarius ssp. thermophilus were studied. in the presence of .15% oxgall, beta-galactosidase activity of whole cells of both species was significantly increased. however, at  a higher concentration (.3% oxgall), the beta-galactosidase activity was significantly less than in the presence of .15% oxgall. the presence of oxgall did not promote the cell lysis of any of the strains of either species. additionally, the presence of oxgall did not cause the leakage of the enzyme from the cells. thus, the presence of oxgall increased the cellular permeability to allow more substrate to enter the cells, thereby increasing beta-galactosidase activity, and, at higher concentrations, was inhibitory to beta-galactosidase activity of both species.

TI  == on-line estimation of biological variables during ph controlled lactic acid fermentations.
AB  == indirect measurement of lactose, galactose, lactic acid, and biomass concentration from on-line sodium hydroxide weight measurements have been obtained for pure and mixed batch cultures of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus 404 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 398 conducted at controlled ph and temperature. linear correlations were established between the equivalent sodium hydroxide concentration and the lactose (substrate), galactose  and lactic acid (products) concentrations while nonlinear relationships were developed between biomass and lactic acid concentrations. these nonlinear relationships took into account the inhibitory effect of lactic acid on growth and acidification. the indirect measurements of biomass concentration were introduced into a nonlinear estimator of the state variables and of the specific  growth and lactic acid production rates. good agreement was found between estimated and measured biomass concentrations (error index ranging from 10.8% to  12.6%). the results showed the feasibility of on-line estimation of biomass concentration and of the specific kinetics from naoh addition weight measurements and its applicability for monitoring lactic acid fermentations. using off-line measurements of l(+) and d(-) lactic acid concentrations, the evolution of the concentration of each strain in mixed cultures was obtained from the relationships proposed for the mixed cultures.

TI  == antimutagenicity of fermented milk.
AB  == reconstituted nonfat dry milk was fermented by lactobacillus helveticus ch65, lactobacillus acidophilus bg2fo4, streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus ch3, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r, and by a mixture of the latter two organisms. the fermented milks were then freeze-dried, extracted in acetone,  dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and assayed for antimutagenicity in the ames test (salmonella typhimurium ta 100) against n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitroso-guanidine,  and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl. dose-dependent activity was significant against both mutagens in all extracts. maximal inhibitory activity against 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl and n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitroso-guanidine was 2-  and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, than that exhibited by extracts of unfermented milk. extracts of milk fermented by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r were examined further. compounds that were responsible for activity against  both mutagens were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dimethylsulfoxide. adjustment of milk fermented by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r to ph 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the activity specific for 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl. in contrast, compounds with activity specific for n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitrosoguanidine were less extractable at ph 7.6. the weak antimutagenicity of unfermented milk was not increased by addition of 2% l-lactic acid.

TI  == feeding of bifidobacterium bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus to infants in hospital for prevention of diarrhoea and shedding of rotavirus.
AB  == acute diarrhoea is a serious cause of infant morbidity and mortality, and the development of preventive measures remains an important goal. bifidobacteria (which constitute the predominant intestinal flora of breastfed infants), as well as other lactic-acid-producing organisms such as streptococcus thermophilus, are  thought to have a protective effect against acute diarrhoeal disease. however, their efficacy has not been assessed in controlled trials. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, infants aged 5-24 months who were admitted to a chronic medical care hospital were randomised to receive a standard infant formula or the same formula supplemented with bifidobacterium bifidum and s thermophilus. patients were evaluated daily for occurrence of diarrhoea, and faecal samples, obtained weekly, were analysed for rotavirus antigen by enzyme immunoassay. faecal samples were also obtained during an episode of diarrhoea for virological  and bacteriological analyses. 55 subjects were evaluated for a total of 4447 patient-days during 17 months. 8 (31%) of the 26 patients who received the control formula and 2 (7%) of 29 who received the supplemented formula developed  diarrhoea during the course of the study (p = 0.035, fisher's exact test, two-tailed). 10 (39%) of the subjects who received the control formula and 3 (10%) of those who received the supplemented formula shed rotavirus at some time  during the study (p = 0.025). the supplementation of infant formula with b bifidum and s thermophilus can reduce the incidence of acute diarrhoea and rotavirus shedding in infants admitted to hospital.

AB  == a general aminopeptidase (st-pepn) was purified from an intracellular extract of  streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus cnrz 302 by ion-exchange chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme in denaturing or nondenaturating conditions showed a single protein band. the enzyme is a monomer with a molecular mass of 97 kda. its activity is maximal at ph 7 and 36 degrees c and is completely abolished by cucl2 and zncl2. the enzyme is strongly inhibited by metal-chelating reagents, such as  edta and o-phenanthroline, which suggests that st-pepn is a metalloenzyme. the enzyme showed activity toward p-nitroanilide derivatives or dipeptides and tripeptides and showed a preference for hydrophobic or basic amino acids at the n-terminal position. longer peptide chains, such as the b-chain of insulin, glucagon, or peptides generated by the hydrolysis of caseins, were degraded, too. the sequence of the first 21 residues of the mature enzyme was determined and showed high homology with that of the aminopeptidase pepn isolated from lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris wg2. the properties of the enzyme are compared with those of corresponding enzymes of other species of lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == aminopeptidase n from streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus ncdo 573: purification and properties.
AB  == a 96 kda aminopeptidase was purified from streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus ncdo 573. the enzyme had similar properties to aminopeptidases isolated from lactococci and lactobacilli and showed a high degree of n-terminal  amino acid sequence homology to aminopeptidase n from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. it catalysed the hydrolysis of a range of aminoacyl 4-nitroanilides and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin derivatives, dipeptides, tripeptides and oligopeptides.  in common with aminopeptidases from other lactic acid bacteria, the enzyme from strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus showed highest activity with lysyl derivatives but was also very active with arginyl and leucyl derivatives. relative activity with alanyl, phenylalanyl, tyrosyl, seryl and valyl derivatives was considerably lower and with glycyl, glutamyl and prolyl derivatives almost negligible. the aminopeptidase also catalysed the hydrolysis of dipeptides and tripeptides but mostly at rates much less than that with l-lysyl-4-nitroanilide and oligopeptides. the enzyme catalysed the successive hydrolysis of various amino acid residues from the n-terminus of several oligopeptides but it was unable to cleave peptide bonds on the n-terminal side of a proline residue.

TI  == gene cloning and characterization of pepc, a cysteine aminopeptidase from streptococcus thermophilus, with sequence similarity to the eucaryotic bleomycin  hydrolase.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus cnrz 302 contains at least three general aminopeptidases able to hydrolyze phe-beta-naphthylamide substrate. the gene encoding one of these aminopeptidases was cloned from a total dna library of s. thermophilus cnrz 302 constructed in escherichia coli tg1 using pbluescript plasmid. the wild-type tg1 strain, although not deficient in aminopeptidase activity, is unable to hydrolyze the substrate phe-beta-naphthylamide, and thus the library could be screened with an enzymic plate assay using this substrate. one clone was selected which was shown to express an aminopeptidase, identified as a pepc-like enzyme on the basis of cross-reactivity with polyclonal antibodies directed against the lactococcal pepc cysteine aminopeptidase. the gene was further subcloned and sequenced. a complete open reading frame coding for a 445-residue (50414 da) polypeptide was identified. 70% identity was found between the deduced amino acid sequence and the sequence of pepc from lactococcus lactis  subspecies cremoris, confirming the identity of the cloned gene. high sequence similarity (38% identity) was also found with an eucaryotic enzyme, bleomycin hydrolase. in addition, the predicted amino acid sequence of the streptococcal pepc showed a region of strong similarity to the active site of cysteine proteinases with conservation of the residues involved in the catalytic site. the product of the cloned pepc gene was overproduced in e. coli and was purified from a cellular extract. purification to homogeneity was achieved by two-step ion-exchange chromatography. biochemical characterization of the pure recombinant enzyme confirms that the cloned peptidase is a thiol aminopeptidase possessing a  broad specificity. the enzyme has a molecular mass of 300 kda suggesting an hexameric structure. on the basis of sequence similarities as well as common biochemical and enzymic properties, the bacterial pepc-type enzymes and the eucaryotic bleomycin hydrolase constitute a new family of thiol aminopeptidases among the cysteine peptidases.

TI  == direct screening of recombinants in gram-positive bacteria using the secreted staphylococcal nuclease as a reporter.
AB  == a system for direct screening of recombinant clones in lactococcus lactis, based  on secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease (snase) in the organism, was developed. the nuc gene (encoding snase) was cloned on both rolling-circle and theta-replicating plasmids. l. lactis strains containing these nuc+ plasmids secrete snase and are readily detectable by a simple plate test. a multicloning site (mcs) was introduced just after the cleavage site between leader peptide and the mature snase, without affecting nuclease activity. cloning foreign dna fragments into any site of the mcs interrupts nuc and thus results in nuc mutant  clones which are easily distinguished fron nuc+ clones on plates. the utility of  this system for l. lactis was demonstrated by cloning an antibiotic resistance marker and escherichia coli chromosomal dna fragments into the mcs of the nucmcs  cassette. both cloning vectors containing the nucmcs cassette were also introduced into streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, in which direct screening of nuc mutant recombinant clones was also achieved. the potential uses  of nuc as a secretion reporter system are discussed.

TI  == directed genomic integration, gene replacement, and integrative gene expression in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == several pgem5- and puc19-derived plasmids containing a selectable erythromycin resistance marker were integrated into the chromosome of streptococcus thermophilus at the loci of the lactose-metabolizing genes. integration occurred  via homologous recombination and resulted in cointegrates between plasmid and genome, flanked by the homologous dna used for integration. selective pressure on the plasmid-located erythromycin resistance gene resulted in multiple amplifications of the integrated plasmid. release of this selective pressure, however, gave way to homologous resolution of the cointegrate structures. by integration and subsequent resolution, we were able to replace the chromosomal lacz gene with a modified copy carrying an in vitro-generated deletion. in the same way, we integrated a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene between the chromosomal lacs and lacz genes of the lactose operon. the inserted cat gene became a functional part of the operon and was expressed and regulated accordingly. selective pressure on the essential lacs and lacz genes under normal growth conditions in milk ensures the maintenance and expression of  the integrated gene. as there are only minimal repeated dna sequences (an ndei site) flanking the inserted cat gene, it was stably maintained even in the absence of lactose, i.e., when grown on sucrose or glucose. the methodology represents a stable system in which to express and regulate foreign genes in s. thermophilus, which could qualify in the future for an application with food.

TI  == effects of transgalactosylated disaccharides on the human intestinal microflora and their metabolism.
AB  == the effects of transgalactosylated disaccharide (td) intake on human fecal microflora and their metabolism were investigated in 12 japanese males. td is a mixture of sugars, galactosyl galactose, and galactosyl glucose, synthesized from lactose through the transgalactosylation reaction of streptococcus thermophilus beta-galactosidase. volunteers took 15 g of the test sugar daily for 6 days. the  td ingestion increased the number of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, but decreased the number of bacteroidaceae and candida spp. in the feces. the ratio of bifidobacteria to total bacteria increased from 0.28 to 0.51. td decreased the fecal concentrations of propionic acid, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, and valeric acid. this sugar also lowered the fecal ph, and the concentrations of fecal ammonia, p-cresol, and indole. moreover, a positive correlation was found between the concentration of ammonia, and that of branched-chain fatty acids (isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid), p-cresol, and indole. all of these compounds are produced from amino acids through deamination by the intestinal bacteria. the depression of amino acid fermentation by intestinal bacteria may be involved in the reduction of fecal ammonia. these results suggest that a part of  the transgalactosylated disaccharides passes into the colon, inducing changes in  the colonic microflora composition, hastening carbohydrate fermentation, and depressing amino acid fermentation in the human gut.

TI  == purification, cloning, and cofactor independence of glutamate racemase from lactobacillus.
AB  == glutamate racemase has been purified more than 12,000-fold from lactobacillus fermenti. the racemase gene has been cloned using standard hybridization techniques combined with a novel selection for in vivo glutamate racemase activity, and the racemase has been expressed in escherichia coli as 20-25% of the total soluble cell protein. the cloned gene product is indistinguishable from that purified from lactobacillus and is a monomer of m(r) 28,300. both a coupled  enzymatic assay and a circular dichroism assay show that the enzyme follows michaelis-menten kinetics, with a km of 0.3 mm and a kcat of 70 s-1 in each reaction direction. investigations into the cofactor dependence of glutamate racemase indicate that the enzyme employs neither pyridoxal phosphate nor a pyruvoyl group in the labilization of the proton at the stereogenic center of glutamate. furthermore, the racemase activity is unaffected by the presence of the metal-chelating reagent edta. the gene sequence of the racemase is 24% identical to that of aspartate racemase from streptococcus thermophilus and 30% identical to that of an unidentified open reading frame in the rrnb ribosomal rna operon of e. coli. because the two cysteine residues in glutamate racemase and their surrounding regions are well-conserved in both of these sequences, and since glutamate racemase is stabilized by the presence of reduced thiols, these residues are possible candidates for the enzymic bases that deprotonate glutamate at c-2.

AB  == the production and biochemical properties of cell envelope-associated proteinases from two strains of streptococcus thermophilus (strains cnrz 385 and cnrz 703) were compared. no significant difference in proteinase activity was found for strain cnrz 385 when cells were grown in skim milk medium and m17 broth. strain cnrz 703 exhibited a threefold-higher proteinase activity when cells were grown in low-heat skim milk medium than when grown in m17 broth. forty-one percent of the total activity of cnrz 385 was localized on the cell wall. the optimum ph for enzymatic activity at 37 degrees c was around 7.0. serine proteinase inhibitors,  such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and diisopropylfluorophosphate, inhibited the enzyme activity in both strains. the divalents cations ca, mg, and mn were activators, while zn and cu were inhibitors. beta-casein was hydrolyzed more rapidly than alpha(s1)-casein. the results of dna hybridization and immunoblot studies suggested that the s. thermophilus cell wall proteinase and the lactococcal proteinase are not closely related.

TI  == antigenotoxic properties of lactic acid bacteria in the s. typhimurium mutagenicity assay.
AB  == a high percentage of human tumors is reported to be related to dietary habits. one way to improve the nutritional impact is to increase the intake of protective factors, such as inhibitors of dna damage and other types of anticarcinogens. specific strains of lactic acid bacteria used to ferment milk are promising candidates that may be antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic. we have studied the antimutagenicity of 10 isolated strains of beneficial lactic acid bacteria. four  types of fermented milk products were also studied for their protective properties. the effect of these bacteria on the yield of revertants induced by nitrosated beef extract was investigated in the salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. eight of 10 isolated lactobacillus strains reduced the yield  of his+ revertants almost back to the levels of the untreated controls. different fermented fresh yogurts containing viable bacteria (probably lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus or lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacteria) showed protective effects as well. the degree of  suppressing revertants was independent of the yogurt's fat content. in contrast,  yogurt products that had been heat treated were not inhibitory. the other fresh fermented milk products (e.g., buttermilk, kefir, and "dickmilch") were not antimutagenic in this study. the results imply that some bacteria used in milk processing have an antimutagenic potential and that this property is specific for the bacterial strain.

TI  == lactose transport system of streptococcus thermophilus. functional reconstitution of the protein and characterization of the kinetic mechanism of transport.
AB  == the kinetic mechanism of the lactose transport system of streptococcus thermophilus was studied in membrane vesicles fused with cytochrome c oxidase containing liposomes and in proteoliposomes in which cytochrome c oxidase was coreconstituted with the lactose transport protein. selective manipulation of the components of the proton (and sodium) motive force indicated that both a membrane potential and a ph gradient could drive transport. the galactoside/proton stoichiometry was close to unity. experiments which discriminate between the effects of internal ph and delta ph as driving force on galactoside/proton symport showed that the carrier is highly activated at alkaline internal ph values, which biases the transport system kinetically toward the ph component of  the proton motive force. galactoside efflux increased with increasing ph with a pka of about 8, whereas galactoside exchange (and counterflow) exhibited a ph optimum around 7 with pka values of 6 and 8, respectively. imposition of delta ph (interior alkaline) retarded the rate of efflux at any ph value tested, whereas the rate of exchange was stimulated by an imposed delta ph at ph 5.8, not affected at ph 7.0, and inhibited at ph 8.0 and 9.0. the results have been evaluated in terms of random and ordered association/dissociation of galactoside  and proton on the inner surface of the membrane. imposition of delta psi (interior negative) decreased the rate of efflux but had no effect on the rate of exchange, indicating that the unloaded transport protein carries a net negative charge and that during exchange and counterflow the carrier recycles in the protonated form.

TI  == effects of bacterial inoculation of high-moisture ear corn on its aerobic stability, digestion, and utilization for growth by beef steers.
AB  == high-moisture ear corn (hmec) was treated with specific bacterial inoculants and  evaluated for its aerobic stability and utilization for growth by beef steers. immediately after harvest, hmec (65% dm) was ensiled in tower silos after being either untreated (control) or treated with the following inoculants: 1) ecosyl (e); 2) ecosyl plus serratia rubidaea (e + sr); and 3) ecosyl plus streptococcus  thermophilus (e + st). a portion of hmec was frozen immediately (-20 degrees c) and subsequently treated with eight bacterial inoculants before ensiling in laboratory silos; the fermented material was then exposed to air for 7 d for assessment of aerobic deterioration. the eight inoculants included the three used in the tower silos and four additional ones: streptococcus thermophilus, bacillus subtilis (bs), serratia rubidaea, and a mixture of ecosyl + b. subtilis (e + bs). the growth trial was conducted for 112 d with 32 crossbred steers (average bw 296 kg). a digestion trial was conducted, according to a 4 x 4 latin square design, using an additional four steers (average bw 367 kg). in both trials, steers were  fed the same four diets containing inoculated (e, e + sr, and e + st) or control  hmec. upon exposure to air, ecosyl-treated ensiled hmec had the least increase in ph compared with other single inoculants; all inoculant treatments lessened (p less than .05) the increase in sample temperature compared with control. during aerobic exposure, treatment of hmec with bs seemed to reduce the disappearance of water-soluble carbohydrates, whereas ecosyl seemed to reduce lactic acid. despite evidence of improved aerobic stability with ecosyl and bs, inoculation of hmec did not (p greater than .10) improve bw gain or feed efficiency; however, all inoculants reduced (p less than .05) digestibility of adf.

TI  == properties of aspartate racemase, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-independent amino acid racemase.
AB  == aspartate racemase from streptococcus thermophilus contains no pyridoxal 5'-phosphate or other cofactors such as fad, nad+, and metal ions. it was affected by neither carbonyl reagents such as hydroxylamine nor sodium borohydride but was strongly inhibited by iodoacetamide and other thiol reagents. aspartate, cysteate, and cysteine sulfinate were the only substrates. the km values for l- and d-aspartate were 35 and 8.7 mm, respectively. the enzyme catalyzed the exchange of alpha-hydrogen of the substrate with the solvent hydrogen. racemization of l-aspartate in 2h2o showed an overshooting in the optical rotation of aspartate before the substrate was fully racemized. this shows that the removal of alpha-hydrogen of the substrate is at least partially rate-determining. when l- or d-aspartate was incubated with aspartate racemase in tritiated water, tritium was incorporated preferentially into the product enantiomer. the results strongly suggest that aspartate racemase contains two hydrogen acceptors.

TI  == different bacteriophage resistance mechanisms in streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain nst5 exhibited a temperature-dependent defence mechanism against the virulent bacteriophages phi b1.2 and phi a1.1. it was active at 42 degrees c but not at 30 degrees c as demonstrated by a significant increase of both plaque size and efficiency of plaquing. this defence mechanism did not affect host-dependent phage replication  and did not interfere with phage adsorption to nst5. these results suggest that it interfered with phage development. the phages phi t33, phi t58, phi d1, phi t21 and phi t9, belonging to the same phage type as phi b1.2, were examined for their ability to infect nst3 and nst5. restriction modification systems of different specificity were detected in nst3 and nst5; host-dependent phage replication was detected at 30 and 42 degrees c; an abortive defence mechanism was detected in nst5 which was active at 42 degrees c, but not 30 degrees c, and  was independent of restriction modification action or interference with phage adsorption. our investigations of phage-host interactions showed that the two str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains studied avoided attack by related bacteriophages by evolving at least three different resistance systems.

TI  == construction and characterization of shuttle plasmids for lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli.
AB  == the chimeric plasmid pbn183 was first constructed in escherichia coli by ligating the bamhi-digested e. coli plasmid pbr322 and a bg/ii-linearized streptococcal plasmid, pnz18. the pbn183 transformed e. coli to apr at a frequency of (8.2 +/-  1.2) x 10(5) colony forming units (cfu)/microgram dna. electrotransformation of streptococcus thermophilus with pbn183 yielded cmr, aps clones at a frequency of  (2.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(1) cfu/microgram dna. plasmid screening with pbn183-transformed s. thermophilus clones revealed that ca. 70% of these transformants contained deleted plasmids. plasmid pbn183a, a pbn183 deletion mutant lacking one copy of a tandemly arranged, highly homologous dna sequence, was isolated for further study. it transformed e. coli to apr and s. thermophilus to cmr with frequencies of (4.8 +/- 0.1) x 10(5) and (8.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(2) cfu/microgram dna, respectively. screening of s. thermophilus transformants did not show the presence of deleted plasmids. based on the structure of pbn183a, a new shuttle plasmid, pdbn183, was constructed from pbn183 by removal of the small (1.2 kb) sa/i fragment. transformation frequencies of pdbn183 were (5.0 +/- 1.3)  x 10(5) and (4.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(2) cfu/microgram dna with e. coli and s. thermophilus, respectively. in contrast to the parent pbn183, only 17% of the pdbn183-transformed s. thermophilus contained deleted plasmids. plasmid copy numbers of the three vectors in e. coli were estimated at 17-18 per chromosome. the three plasmids conferred apr and cmr to e. coli, but only cmr to s. thermophilus. the insertion of a streptomyces cholesterol oxidase gene (choa) into pdbn183 did not affect the plasmid's stability in lactobacillus casei, but resulted in deletion of the recombinant dna in s. thermophilus.

TI  == lactose transport system of streptococcus thermophilus. the role of histidine residues.
AB  == the lactose transport protein (lacs) of streptococcus thermophilus is a chimeric  protein consisting of an amino-terminal carrier domain and a carboxyl-terminal phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) iia protein domain. the histidine residues of lacs were changed individually into glutamine or arginine residues. of the 11 histidine residues present in lacs, only the his-376 substitution in the carrier domain significantly affected sugar transport. the region around his-376 was found to exhibit sequence similarity to the region around his-322 of the lactose transport protein (lacy) of escherichia coli, which has been implicated in sugar binding and in coupling of sugar and h+ transport. the h376q mutation resulted in a reduced rate of uptake and altered affinity for  lactose (beta-galactoside), melibiose (alpha-galactoside), and the lactose analog methyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside. similarly, the extent of accumulation of the galactosides by cells expressing lacs(h376q) was highly reduced in comparison to  cells bearing the wild-type protein. nonequilibrium exchange of lactose and methyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside by the h376q mutant was approximately 2-fold  reduced in comparison to the activity of the wild-type transport protein. the data indicate that his-376 is involved in sugar recognition and is important, but not essential, for the cotransport of protons and galactosides. the carboxyl-terminal domain of lacs contains 2 histidine residues (his-537 and his-552) that are conserved in seven homologous iia protein(s) (domains) of ptss. p-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of wild-type lacs, but not of the mutant h552q, was demonstrated using purified enzyme i and hpr, the general energy coupling proteins of the pts, and inside-out membrane vesicles isolated from e. coli in which the lactose transport gene was expressed. the his-537 and his-552 mutations did not affect transport activity when the corresponding genes were expressed in e. coli.

TI  == [clinical consequences of replacing milk with yogurt in persistent infantile diarrhea].
AB  == persistent diarrhea is an episode of diarrhea that begins acutely but lasts longer than expected for this usually self-limited disease. treatment of this ill-defined syndrome is not well standardized but immediate intervention is required to minimize the risk of malnutrition with its various consequences. this randomized clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate the clinical efficacy of substituting yogurt for milk, as the only treatment. after a one to two-day observation period during which a standard milk diet was given, 78 children aged  3 to 36 months with confirmed persistent diarrhea of more than 15 days but less than one month duration and negative tests for fecal blood were fed either milk (infant formula) or yogurt (infant formula fermented with lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus). at inclusion both groups were comparable for age, nutritional status, diarrhea, and lactose hydrogen breath test results. clinical treatment failure (weight loss greater than 5% in one day  or persistent diarrhea after 5 days) was significantly less common in children fed yogurt (15 +/- 6%) than in children fed milk (45 +/- 8%). the beneficial effects of feeding yogurt were apparent within 48 hours in 67 +/- 8% of infants.  in conclusion, these data confirm the clinical efficacy of substituting yogurt for milk in young children with persistent diarrhea. they also suggest that yogurt may be a good alternative for the initial treatment of persistent diarrhea.

TI  == strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  == lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. to evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of s thermophilus, l bulgaricus, l acidophilus, or bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. all yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. the response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with b bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with l bulgaricus milk. the results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.

AB  == the distribution of aspartate racemase (ec 5.1.1.13) in various kinds of bacteria demonstrated that the enzyme occurs in lactic acid bacteria, such as streptococcus species and lactobacillus species. the enzyme from streptococcus thermophilus iam10064 was more thermostable than that from streptococcus lactis iam1198 which contained the enzyme most abundantly among the lactic acid bacteria we examined here. we purified the enzyme about 3400-fold to homogeneity from cell-free extract of s. thermophilus, which is composed of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of 28,000 as a homodimer. the enzyme utilizes specifically aspartate as a substrate, but not alanine and glutamate. maximal reaction velocity was observed at 37 degrees c and around ph 8.0. the sequence of the nh2-terminal amino acids of the enzyme was determined to be met-glu-asn-phe-phe-ser-ile-leu-gly-xxx-met-gly-thr-met-ala-thr-glu-ser- phe-.

TI  == galactose utilization in lactobacillus helveticus: isolation and characterization of the galactokinase (galk) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (galt) genes.
AB  == by complementing appropriate gal lesions in escherichia coli k802, we were able to isolate the galactokinase (galk) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase  (galt) genes of lactobacillus helveticus. tn10 transposon mutagenesis, together with in vivo complementation analysis and in vitro enzyme activity measurements,  allowed us to map these two genes. the dna sequences of the genes and the flanking regions were determined. these revealed that the two genes are organized in the order galk-galt in an operonlike structure. in an in vitro transcription-translation assay, the galk and galt gene products were identified  as 44- and 53-kda proteins, respectively, data which corresponded well with the dna sequencing data. the deduced amino acid sequence of the galk gene product showed significant homologies to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic galactokinase sequences, whereas galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase did not show any sequence similarities to other known proteins. this observation, together with a  comparison of known gal operon structures, suggested that the l. helveticus operon developed independently to a translational expression unit having a different gene order than that in e. coli, streptococcus lividans, or saccharomyces cerevisiae. dna sequencing of the flanking regions revealed an open reading frame downstream of the galkt operon. it was tentatively identified as galm (mutarotase) on the basis of the significant amino acid sequence homology with the corresponding streptococcus thermophilus gene.

TI  == molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the aspartate racemase gene from lactic acid bacteria streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the gene coding aspartate racemase (ec 5.1.1.13) was cloned from the lactic acid  bacteria streptococcus thermophilus iam10064 and expressed efficiently in escherichia coli. the 2.1 kilobase pairs long full length clone had an open reading frame of 729 nucleotides coding for 243 amino acids. the calculated molecular weight of 27,945 agreed well with the apparent molecular weight of 28,000 found in sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the aspartate racemase purified from s. thermophilus. the n-terminal amino acid sequence from the purified protein exactly matches the derived sequence. in  addition, the amino acid composition compiled from the derived sequence is very similar to that obtained from the purified recombinant protein. no significantly  homologous proteins were found in a protein sequence data bank. even the homology scores with alanine racemases of salmonella typhimurium and bacillus stearothermophilus were low. aspartate racemase was overproduced in escherichia coli nm522 with plasmid pag6-2-7, which was constructed from two copies of the gene linked with a tac promoter and plasmid vector puc18. the amount of aspartate racemase increases with the growth of e. coli and almost no degradation of the enzyme was observed. the maximum amount of the produced enzyme reached approx. 20% of the total protein of e. coli.

TI  == isolation and characterization of chromosomal promoters of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  == a promoter probe vector, ptg244, was constructed with the aim of isolating transcription initiation signals from streptococcus thermophilus (streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). ptg244 is based on the escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector ptg222, into which the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of bacillus pumilus (cat-86) was cloned. random sau3a fragments from the s. thermophilus a054 chromosomal dna were cloned  upstream of the cat-86 gene by using e. coli as the host. the pool of recombinant plasmids were introduced into s. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in order to search for promoter activity in these hosts. for s. thermophilus, it was necessary to first select erythromycin-resistant transformants and then to screen for chloramphenicol resistance among these. direct selection of chloramphenicol-resistant clones was, however, possible in l. lactis subsp. lactis. six fragments exhibiting promoter activity were characterized in s. thermophilus by measuring the levels of cat-86 transcription  and/or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specific activity. three of the promoter-carrying fragments were sequenced. the 5' ends of their corresponding mrnas were determined by s1 mapping and shown to correspond to a purine residue in all cases. upstream from these potential transcription start points, sequences homologous to the e. coli sigma 70 and the bacillus subtilis vegetative sigma 43  (or sigma a) consensus promoters were identified.

TI  == the presence of two forms of the phosphocarrier protein hpr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococci.
AB  == the protein, hpr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts) in bacteria, was purified from streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. the purified preparation gave only one band  when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pi = 4.85). however, electrophoresis in tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by pep in the presence of enzyme i of the pts or by atp with the hpr kinase. homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained  by preparative electrophoresis. each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the  doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. the electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees c for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees c for several months. both hpr proteins catalyzed in vitro the pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with  a preparation of hpr containing both forms of the protein. both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from pep to the other specific pts proteins  known in s salivarius. rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. the presence of the 2 forms of hpr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of s salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. a doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (s mutans, s sobrinus, s sanguis, s thermophilus, s  bovis, s rattus) and also in l lactis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == lactose uptake driven by galactose efflux in streptococcus thermophilus: evidence for a galactose-lactose antiporter.
AB  == galactose-nonfermenting (gal) streptococcus thermophilus ts2 releases galactose into the extracellular medium when grown in medium containing excess lactose. starved and de-energized gal cells, however, could be loaded with galactose to levels approximately equal to the extracellular concentration (0 to 50 mm). when  loaded cells were separated from the medium and resuspended in fresh broth containing 5 mm lactose, galactose efflux occurred. de-energized, galactose-loaded cells, resuspended in buffer or medium, accumulated [c]lactose at a greater rate and to significantly higher intracellular concentrations than unloaded cells. uptake of lactose by loaded cells was inhibited more than that by unloaded cells in the presence of extracellular galactose, indicating that a galactose gradient was involved in the exchange system. when de-energized, galactose-loaded cells were resuspended in carbohydrate-free medium at ph 6.7, a  proton motive force (deltap) of 86 to 90 mv was formed, whereas de-energized, nonloaded cells maintained a deltap of about 56 mv. however, uptake of lactose by loaded cells occurred when the proton motive force was abolished by the addition  of an uncoupler or in the presence of a proton-translocating atpase inhibitor. these results support the hypothesis that galactose efflux in gals. thermophilus  is electrogenic and that the exchange reaction (lactose uptake and galactose efflux) probably occurs via an antiporter system.

TI  == lactose metabolism in lactobacillus bulgaricus: analysis of the primary structure and expression of the genes involved.
AB  == the genes coding for the lactose permease and beta-galactosidase, two proteins involved in the metabolism of lactose by lactobacillus bulgaricus, have been cloned, expressed, and found functional in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequences of these genes and their flanking regions have been determined, showing the presence of two contiguous open reading frames (orfs). one of these orfs codes for the lactose permease gene, and the other codes for the beta-galactosidase gene. the lactose permease gene is located in front of the beta-galactosidase gene, with 3 bp in the intergenic region. the two genes are probably transcribed as one operon. primer extension studies have mapped a promoter upstream from the lactose permease gene but not the beta-galactosidase gene. this promoter is similar to those found in e. coli with general characteristics of gc-rich organisms. in addition, the sequences around the promoter contain a significantly higher number of at base pairs (80%) than does the overall l. bulgaricus genome, which is rich in gc (gc content of 54%). the amino acid sequences obtained from translation of the orfs are found to be highly homologous (similarity of 75%) to those from streptococcus thermophilus. the first 460 amino acids of the lactose permease shows homology to the melibiose transport protein of e. coli. little homology was found between the lactose permease of l. bulgaricus and e. coli, but the residues which are involved in the binding and the transport of lactose are conserved. the carboxy terminus is similar to that of the enzyme iii of several phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems.

TI  == analysis of the lacz sequences from two streptococcus thermophilus strains: comparison with the escherichia coli and lactobacillus bulgaricus beta-galactosidase sequences.

TI  == antitumor activity of streptococcus thermophilus against fibrosarcoma: role of t-cells.
AB  == antitumor activity induced by a heat-killed preparation of s. thermophilus against mouse fibrosarcoma was investigated. the treatment of swiss mice with s.  thermophilus prior to transplantation could not prevent tumors. however, animals  cured by treatment with a s. thermophilus preparation failed to take up the tumor when rechallenged with fibrosarcoma. s. thermophilus did not induce antitumor activity in animals immunosuppressed by sublethal whole body gamma-irradiation (4 gy) or hydrocortisone treatment prior to transplantation. suppression of activity of macrophages by carrageenan had no effect on antitumor activity of the heat inactivated preparation of s. thermophilus. the intravenous administration of sera from cured animals was ineffective in curing the tumours. spleen cells from  cured animals could effectively transfer the antitumor activity to recipients transplanted with the tumor. this effect was abolished when the t-lymphocyte population in the inoculum was specifically depleted. the results thus suggest the involvement of t-lymphocytes in antitumor activity exhibited by s. thermophilus.

TI  == influence of nonfermented dairy products containing bacterial starter cultures on lactose maldigestion in humans.

AB  == the complete nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding aldose 1-epimerase (mutarotase) (galm) and udpglucose 4-epimerase (gale) and flanking regions of streptococcus thermophilus have been determined. both genes are located immediately upstream of the s. thermophilus lac operon. to facilitate the isolation of gale, a special polymerase chain reaction-based technique was used to amplify the region upstream of galm prior to cloning. the galm protein was homologous to the mutarotase of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, whereas the gale protein was homologous to udpglucose 4-epimerase of escherichia coli and streptomyces lividans. the amino acid sequences of galm and gale proteins also showed significant similarity with the carboxy-terminal and amino-terminal domains, respectively, of udpglucose 4-epimerase from kluyveromyces lactis and saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that the yeast enzymes contain an additional, yet unidentified (mutarotase) activity. in accordance with the open reading frames of the structural genes, galm and gale were expressed as polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 39 and 37 kilodaltons, respectively. significant activities of mutarotase and udpglucose 4-epimerase were detected in lysates of e. coli cells containing plasmids encoding galm and gale. expression of gale in e. coli was increased 300-fold when the gene was placed downstream of the tac promoter. the gene order for the gal-lac gene cluster of s. thermophilus is gale-galm-lacs-lacz. the flanking regions of these  genes were searched for consensus promoter sequences and further characterized by primer extension analysis. analysis of mrna levels for the gal and lac genes in s. thermophilus showed a strong reduction upon growth in medium containing glucose instead of lactose. the activities of the lac (lactose transport and beta-galactosidase) and gal (udpglucose 4-epimerase) proteins of lactose- and glucose-grown s. thermophilus cells matched the mrna levels.

AB  == the two restriction enzymes smai and apai were found to produce distributions of  dna fragments useful for genome analysis of some lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus) by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the genome size was estimated to be 1750 to 2500 kb depending on the species. each strain displayed unique restriction patterns; nevertheless, the percentage of the comigrating fragments of two isogenic or closely related strains was about 80% and fell to 20-40% when the patterns of two non-related strains of the same species or two strains belonging  to different species were compared.

TI  == effect of threonine and glycine concentrations on threonine aldolase activity of  yogurt microorganisms during growth in a modified milk prepared by ultrafiltration.
AB  == to evaluate the combined effects of threonine and glycine concentrations during growth on threonine aldolase activity (ec 2.1.2.1) of yogurt microorganisms, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, a modified milk growth medium was prepared using uf to deplete the free amino acid level. threonine and  glycine were added according to a 2x2x2 factorial design at 5 or 195 microg.ml(-1) along with a standard amino acid mixture. acetaldehyde production and threonine aldolase activity were evaluated utilizing headspace gas chromatography. results showed that threonine and glycine concentrations did not  affect growth or titratable acidity. the high concentration of threonine in combination with low glycine in the growth medium resulted in increased acetaldehyde synthesis by both microorganisms. conversely, high glycine with low  threonine decreased acetaldehyde synthesis. high threonine and low glycine increased threonine aldolase activity of cell-free extracts from s. thermophilus  and l. bulgaricus, whereas high glycine and low threonine reduced threonine aldolase activity of both microorganisms.

TI  == purification and substrate specificity of a strongly hydrophobic extracellular metalloendopeptidase ("gelatinase") from streptococcus faecalis (strain 0g1-10).
AB  == an extracellular zn-endopeptidase was purified to homogeneity from the culture filtrates of streptococcus faecalis (human oral strain 0g1-10) by a procedure that comprised concentration in an amicon hollow fiber system, ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel permeation chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (batch operation on phenyl-sepharose cl-4b), followed by fast protein liquid chromatography (fplc) on a phenyl-superose hr 5/5 column, and finally fplc on a superose 12 hr 10/30 column. the enzyme is a 31.5-kda strongly  hydrophobic protein with an isoelectric point of 4.6 and a broad ph optimum of 6  to 8. the substrate specificity of the enzyme is similar to that of the mammalian membrane endopeptidase-24.11 and streptococcus thermophilus thermolysin (ec 3.4.24.4) in hydrolyzing preferentially the phe24-phe25 bond in insulin b-chain,  followed by cleavage of the his5-leu6 bond. the enzyme was especially active on azocoll and gelatin; soluble and insoluble collagens were hydrolyzed at a lower rate. s. faecalis sex pheromone-related peptides and several mammalian bioactive  peptides were cleaved at sites involving pronounced hydrophobicity. the enzyme did not hydrolyze small synthetic peptide derivatives (phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-l-pro-l-leu-gly-l-pro-d-arg and 2-furylacryloyl-l-leu-gly-l-ala) that are typically attacked by "true" bacterial  collagenases. chemical modification indicated the importance of histidyl, carboxyl, and tyrosyl groups in enzyme activity, suggesting that this enzyme may  thus be classified as a metalloprotease ii (ec 3.4.24.4). the enzyme is strongly  inhibited by a 720-kda factor present in rat inflammatory exudate. the pronounced ability of the enzyme to attack collagenous materials and certain bioactive peptides suggests its participation in inflammatory processes involving the presence of s. faecalis.

TI  == a method for determining beta-galactosidase activity of yogurt cultures in skim milk.
AB  == a method was developed for determining the specific activity of bacterial beta-galactosidase (ec 3.2.1.23) during growth of streptococcus thermophilus and  lactobacillus bulgaricus in skim milk. individual and mixed strain cultures of s. thermophilus (st 3642, st14485) and l. bulgaricus (lb11842, lb880) were examined  for growth (od at 600 nm and viable cell counts), acid production, and beta-galactosidase activity (expressed as a function of recoverable tca-precipitable cellular protein). cultures were inoculated into 10% skim milk (2% inoculum) and incubated at 40 degrees c for 12 h. aliquots were removed at 2-h intervals and diluted with ice cold edta, ph 12. the edta chelates calcium and solubilizes milk protein, allowing separation of the bacteria by centrifugation. cells were then washed twice with 20 mm phosphate buffer and disrupted by sonication. cell debris and intact cells were removed by centrifugation and the cell-free extract evaluated for beta-galactosidase activity using o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. specific activities ranged from 0 to 6 units/mg protein. this simple and reproducible method is applicable for enzyme assays and measurement of cellular components where contamination by milk proteins is a potential problem.

AB  == cells of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis entrapped in k-carrageenan-locust bean gum gel performed similarly  to free cells in the conversion of lactose to lactic acid. bead diameter influenced the fermentation rate. cells entrapped in smaller beads (0.5 to 1.0 mm) showed higher release rates, higher lactose, glucose, and formic acid utilization, higher galactose accumulation, and higher lactic acid production than did cells entrapped in larger beads (1.0 to 2.0 mm). values for smaller beads were comparable with those for free cells. immobilization affected the fermentation rate of lactic acid bacteria, especially lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. entrapped cells of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus demonstrated a lower lactic acid production than did free cells in batch fermentation. the kinetics of the production of formic and pyruvic acids by l. lactis subsp. lactis and s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus are presented.

TI  == lactose transport system of streptococcus thermophilus: a hybrid protein with homology to the melibiose carrier and enzyme iii of phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems.
AB  == the gene responsible for the transport of lactose into streptococcus thermophilus (lacs) was cloned in escherichia coli as a 4.2-kilobase fragment from an ecori library of chromosomal dna by using the vector pkk223-3. from deletion analysis,  the gene for lactose transport mapped to two hindiii fragments with a total size  of 2.8 kilobases. the gene was transcribed in e. coli from its own promoter. functional expression of lactose transport activity was shown by assaying for the uptake and exchange of lactose both in intact cells and in membrane vesicles. the nucleotide sequence of lacs and 200 to 300 bases of 3' and 5' flanking regions were determined. the gene was 1,902 base pairs long, encoding a 69,454-dalton protein with an nh2-terminal hydrophobic region and a cooh-terminal hydrophilic region. the nh2-terminal end was homologous with the melibiose carrier of e. coli (23% similarity overall; greater than 50% similarity for regions with at least 16 amino acids), whereas the cooh-terminal end showed 34 to 41% similarity with the  enzyme iii (domain) of three different phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems. among the conserved amino acids were two histidyl residues, of which one has been postulated to be phosphorylated by hpr. since sugars are not phosphorylated during translocation by the lactose transport system, it is suggested that the enzyme iii-like region serves a regulatory function in this protein. the lacs gene also appears similar to the partially sequenced lactose transport gene of lactobacillus bulgaricus (lacl; greater than  60% similarity). furthermore, the 3' flanking sequence of the s. thermophilus lactose transport gene showed approximately 50% similarity with the n-terminal portion of the beta-galactosidase gene of l. bulgaricus. in both organisms, the lactose transport gene and the beta-galactosidase appear to be separated by a 3-base-pair intercistronic region.

AB  == growth and germination of vegetative cells and endospores of bacillus cereus were affected by streptococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus bulgaricus in nonfat milk medium and by salts of organic acids in broth medium. growth of the lactic acid bacteria was not affected by b. cereus. b. cereus increased rapidly to about 10 cfu/ml when cells  were added at the beginning of growth of lactic acid bacteria; it was inactivated slowly when added after 24 h and rapidly when added after 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. streptococci were more inhibitory to the growth of b. cereus than lactobacilli were at 24 h. spore germination was not affected after 24 h, but it was inhibited after 48 and 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. acetate was more inhibitory to the growth of vegetative cells, while formate was more inhibitory to spore germination. acetate, formate, and lactate (all at 0.1 m) completely inactivated multiplication of b. cereus at ph 6.1, 6.0, and 5.6, respectively. spores of b. cereus were more resistant to these organic acids compared with the resistance of vegetative cells. formate, lactate, and acetate (all at 0.1 m) caused 50% inhibition of spore germination at ph 4.4, 4.3, and 4.2, respectively.

AB  == the effect of the oral and subcutaneous administration of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus on humoral antibody production and delayed type hypersensitivity response against sheep red blood cells (srbc) was studied. the species of the genus lactobacillus proved to be more effective in both cases, effects being stronger when working with viable bacteria than with non-viable cells. the stimulation of primary cellular and humoral immune responses reached optimal activity with a dose of 6 x 10(9) cells. the plaque-forming cells (pfc) and the circulating antibody titers to the srbc antigen obtained in the groups treated with lactobacilli were 2 to 3 times higher than those of the non-treated control  group. in mice fed with the different lactic acid bacteria circulating antibody against these microorganisms failed to be detected, but when they were administered by subcutaneous route a strong response to antilactic acid bacteria  was stimulated. s. thermophilus was not effective in increasing the immune response. these results suggest that the lactobacilli by oral route, exert a strong adjuvant activity which is responsible for the enhanced host immune responses obtained. in this respect, lactobacilli could be considered as the most promising oral adjuvant.

TI  == development of an efficient spheroplast transformation procedure for s. thermophilus: the use of transfection to define a regeneration medium.
AB  == the conditions for the efficient polyethylene glycol (peg)-induced spheroplast transformation of three strains of streptococcus thermophilus have been established. this required the careful optimization of various experimental parameters, the most important being the choice of the lytic enzyme (lysozyme versus mutanolysin), the extent of cell wall digestion and the conditions for the peg shock which were found to be strain-specific. the transfection assay we had previously developed for s. thermophilus represented a key step and powerful tool in our transformation studies. it allowed individual and stepwise adjustment of the above mentioned factors, but was also compulsory for the establishment of an  effective regeneration medium for the strains we examined. among various potential osmotic protectors tested, raffinose in combination with cacl2 and mgcl2 was most efficient and routinely supported regeneration with up to 10% efficiency, after peg treatment. with the spheroplast transformation procedure described in this paper, shuttle vectors and recombinant plasmids could be introduced into three industrial yogurt starters, with maximal efficiencies of 7.5 x 10(4) transformants/micrograms of liposome encapsulated, covalently closed  circular dna. a striking, yet unexplained, reduction in transformation rates was  observed when erythromycin rather than chloramphenicol was used as the selecting  agent.

TI  == effect of oxygen on lactose metabolism in lactic streptococci.
AB  == three strains of streptococcus lactis, two of streptococcus cremoris, and one of  streptococcus thermophilus metabolized oxygen in the presence of added carbohydrate primarily via a closely coupled nadh oxidase/nadh peroxidase system. no buildup of the toxic intermediate h(2)o(2) was detected with the three s. lactis strains. all six strains contained significant superoxide dismutase activity and are clearly aerotolerant. lactose- or glucose-driven oxygen consumption was biphasic, with a rapid initial rate followed by a slower secondary rate which correlated with factors affecting the in vivo activation of  lactate dehydrogenase. the rate of oxygen consumption was rapid under conditions  that led to a reduction in lactate dehydrogenase activity (low intracellular fructose 1,6-bisphosphate concentration). these conditions could be achieved with nongrowing cells by adding lactose at a constant but limiting rate. when the rate of lactose fermentation was limited to 5% of its maximum, nongrowing cells of s.  lactis strains ml3 and ml8 carried out an essentially homoacetic fermentation under aerobic conditions. these same cells carried out the expected homolactic fermentation when presented with excess lactose under anaerobic conditions. homoacetic fermentation leads to the generation of more energy, by substrate-level phosphorylation via acetate kinase, than the homolactic fermentation. however, it was not observed in growing cells and was restricted to slow fermentation rates with nongrowing cells.

AB  == the antimutagenic properties of milk cultured with lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus were examined using streptomycin-dependent strains of  salmonella in an in vitro assay system. the mutagens utilized for testing included 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide, 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide, and fecal mutagenic extracts from cats, monkeys, dogs, and other mammals. both types of cultured milk exhibited antimutagenic activity on all mutagens used. antimutagenic activities of the cultured milks with 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide and 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide increased with incubation time but were thermolabile beyond 55 degrees c for 10 min.

TI  == cloning and expression of the beta-d-galactosidase gene from streptococcus thermophilus in escherichia coli.
AB  == the beta-d-galactosidase (beta-gal) gene from streptococcus thermophilus was cloned to isolate and characterize it for potential use as a selection marker in  a food-grade cloning vector. chromosomal dna from s. thermophilus 19258 was cleaved with the restriction enzyme psti and ligated to pbr322 for transformation into escherichia coli jm108. a beta-galactosidase-positive clone was detected by  its blue color on a medium supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactoside. this transformant possessed a single plasmid, designated prh116, which contained, in addition to the vector dna, a 7.0-kilobase (kb) psti insertion fragment coding for beta-gal activity. an extract from jm108(prh116) contained a beta-gal protein with the same electrophoretic mobility as the beta-gal from s. thermophilus 19258. compared with the beta-gal from e. coli hb101, the s. thermophilus beta-gal was of lower molecular weight. a restriction map of prh116 was constructed from cleavage of both the plasmid and the purified insert. the construction of deletion derivatives of prh116 with bglii, bsteii, and hindiii revealed the approximate location of the gene on the 7.0-kb fragment. the beta-gal gene was further localized to a 3.85-kb region.

TI  == utilization of spline functions for smoothing fermentation data and for estimation of specific rates.
AB  == a response surface method of smoothing fermentation data with spline functions is presented. the available electron balance is used to optimally select the values  of the smoothing parameters associated with the spline functions. the method is applied to six sets of anaerobic fermentation data in which pure and mixed cultures are grown in batch followed by fed batch culture. lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus are cultured on 3% dry milk. measured concentrations of biomass, lactose, galactose, lactic acid, and other acid products are smoothed using spline functions. values of specific growth rate, specific lactose consumption rate, specific galactose formation rate, and specific acid product formation rate are estimated and the consistency of the results is examined using the available electron balance. the results show that the method works reasonably well, but that an upper bound should be used for the  smoothing parameters to obtain accurate estimates of the derivative quantities.

TI  == analysis of exponential growth data for yoghurt cultures.
AB  == obtaining accurate estimates of maximum specific growth rate, growth yield, and product yield is important for many fermentation processes. a systematic procedure is presented to select the exponential growth region and estimate the maximum specific growth rate using the covariate adjustment method with all the available measured variables (i.e. biomass, substrate, and product). the procedure is applied to data collected during growth of pure and mixed cultures of lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus on 3% dry milk under anaerobic conditions. the estimation procedure gives good estimates with relatively narrow confidence intervals even though biomass concentration is measured by an indirect method. the estimated values of maximum specific growth rate range from 0.2805 h(-1) for s. thermophilus (atcc-19258) to 0.4672 h(-1) for s. thermophilus (microlife). growth and product yields are estimated using regression analysis and the data for the exponential growth region. the growth yields are compared to their theoretical maximum values.

AB  == the effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (vigna unguiculata), peanut (arachis hypogea), soybean (glycine max), and sorghum (sorghum vulgare) were studied. the  bacteria investigated were lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. during fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, ph, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees  c. maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, ph, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. the maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in ph. change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. in the extracts inoculated simultaneously with l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, a  synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased ph in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. fermented  extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.

TI  == galactokinase activity in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == atp-dependent phosphorylation of [14c]galactose by 11 strains of streptococcus thermophilus indicated that these organisms possessed the leloir enzyme, galactokinase (galk). activities were 10 times higher in fully induced, galactose-fermenting (gal+) strains than in galactose-nonfermenting (gal-) strains. lactose-grown, gal- cells released free galactose into the medium and were unable to utilize residual galactose or to induce galk above basal levels. gal+ s. thermophilus 19258 also released galactose into the medium, but when lactose was depleted growth on galactose commenced, and galk increased from 0.025 to 0.22 micromol of galactose phosphorylated per min per mg of protein. when lactose was added to galactose-grown cells of s. thermophilus 19258, galk activity rapidly decreased. these results suggest that galk in gal+ s. thermophilus is subject to an induction-repression mechanism, but that galk cannot be induced in gal- strains.

TI  == galactose transport in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == although streptococcus thermophilus accumulated [14c]lactose in the absence of an endogenous energy source, galactose-fermenting (gal+) cells were unable to accumulate [14c]galactose unless an additional energy source was added to the test system. both gal+ and galactose-nonfermenting (gal-) strains transported galactose when preincubated with sucrose. accumulation was inhibited 50 or 95% when 10 mm sodium fluoride or 1.0 mm iodoacetic acid, respectively, was added to  sucrose-treated cells, indicating that atp was required for galactose transport activity. proton-conducting ionophores also inhibited galactose uptake, although  n,n'-dicyclohexyl carbodiimide had no effect. the results suggest that galactose  transport in s. thermophilus occurs via an atp-dependent galactose permease and that a proton motive force is involved. the galactose permease in s. thermophilus ts2b (gal+) had a km for galactose of 0.25 mm and a vmax of 195 micromol of galactose accumulated per min per g (dry weight) of cells. several structurally similar sugars inhibited galactose uptake, indicating that the galactose permease had high affinities for these sugars.

TI  == use of microbial beta-lactamase to destroy penicillin added to milk.
AB  == a simple method is described for destruction of penicillin residues in bulk milk  to an undetectable amount (less than .003 u/ml) with commercially available crude beta-lactamase enzyme. milk containing .1 or .5 u/ml penicillin g was treated with .01 to 1.0 mu/ml of beta-lactamase (bacillus cereus) for up to 96 h. the bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis assay was used to quantify penicillin in milk between .003 to 1.0 u/ml. the .5 u/ml of penicillin g was reduced to an undetectable amount within 18 h at 4 degrees c by 1.0 mu/ml of beta-lactamase. the development of titratable acidity over 5 to 6 h in contaminated milks treated with beta-lactamase and inoculated with streptococcus  thermophilus gh, streptococcus cremoris, streptococcus lactis, or a commercial starter culture was the same as for control milk samples containing no additives  or only enzyme. pilot-scale manufacture of swiss and cheddar cheeses from contaminated milks treated with beta-lactamase yielded cheeses of comparable quality, to control cheeses produced from penicillin-free milk. there were no delays in acid production as judged from ph measurements during production and ripening of the cheeses. about 50% of beta-lactamase activity added to milk remained after pasteurization at 63 degrees c for 30 min. the safety for human consumption of cheese containing small quantities of penicillin degradation products from milk treated with beta-lactamase remains to be established.

TI  == nutritional value of yogurt.
AB  == yogurt, made from fortified skim milk by conventional methods using streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, was used in studies of the effect of fermentation on nutritional value of milk. in all experiments, the product was compared with the uninoculated base milk. the concentration of most vitamins was  less in yogurt than in milk and was most noticeably so for biotin which was 60% less. the effect on folic acid content was inconsistent. in nutritional experiments with rats, high values for true digestibility, biological value and net protein utilization were obtained for both yogurt and its base milk, only minor differences being apparent between the two materials. in growth tests with  rats, yogurt was not found to be consistently superior to the base milk when the  milk was subjected to a double heat treatment to reduce bacterial contamination.  yogurt did not confer a nutritional advantage on fresh milk in this respect.

TI  == selection of galactose-fermenting streptococcus thermophilus in lactose-limited chemostat cultures.
AB  == stock cultures of streptococcus thermophilus are essentially galactose negative (gal). although both galactose 1-phosphate uridyl transferase and uridine-5-diphospho-glucose 4-epimerase are present, suggesting that the genes for the leloir pathway exist, cells cannot induce high levels of galactokinase. therefore, galactose is largely excreted when cultures are grown on lactose, and  most strains cannot be readily adapted to grow on free galactose. gal cultures were grown in a chemostat under lactose limitation in which high concentrations of residual galactose were present. under this selection pressure, gal organisms  eventually took over the culture with all four strains examined. gal cells had induced galactokinase, and three of the four strains grew on free galactose with  doubling times of 40 to 50 min. when gal organisms were grown on lactose in batch culture, the galactose moiety was only partially utilized while lactose was still present. as lactose was exhausted, and catabolite repression was lifted, the leloir pathway enzymes (especially galactokinase) were induced and the residual galactose fermented. neither phospho-beta-galactosidase activity nor the enzymes  of the d-tagatose 6-phosphate pathway were detected in s. thermophilus. in contrast to streptococcus cremoris and streptococcus lactis, fermentation was homolactic with galactose in batch cultures and with lactose limitation in the chemostat. when mixed gal-gal cultures were repeatedly transferred in milk, the gal cells became the dominant cell type. the gal phenotype of stock cultures probably reflects their prolonged maintenance in milk.

TI  == the effect of yoghurt on some components of the gut microflora and on the metabolism of lactose in the rat.
AB  == feeding yoghurt or base milk (from which the yoghurt was prepared by fermentation) to rats increased the counts of coliforms in the gut whereas the counts of lactobacilli were reduced by yoghurt but not by the base milk. lactobacillus bulgaricus survived in the guts of gnotobiotic and conventional rats when yoghurt was fed continuously. streptococcus thermophilus also survived  in gnotobiotic rats but its ability to survive in conventional rats could not be  examined. both organisms failed to colonise the gut when a small inoculum of yoghurt was administered orally to germfree rats maintained on the stock diet. streptococcus thermophilus but not lact. bulgaricus grew in the rat diet when tested in vitro. two enzyme systems (beta-galactosidase and lactase) were studied using, respectively, o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (onpg) and lactose as the test substrates. enzyme levels estimated with both substrates increased in the gut contents when rats were fed yoghurt but an increase was only found with onpg in the intestinal mucosa fraction. the bacterial origin of all this increased activity is discussed. the other lactose-containing diets did not affect enzyme activity to the same degree. feeding yoghurt changed the lactobacillus flora from one which was predominantly heterofermentative (lact. reuteri ) to one which was predominantly homofermentative (lact. salivarius).

TI  == utilization of lactose, glucose, and galactose by a mixed culture of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus in milk treated with lactase enzyme.
AB  == the mechanism responsible for an increased rate of acid production when yogurt starter cultures are grown in milk treated with lactase enzyme was investigated by studying carbohydrate utilization and acid development by a pure culture of streptococcus thermophilus and a mixed yogurt starter culture consisting of s. thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus. in milk containing glucose, galactose, and lactose, glucose and lactose (but not free galactose) were fermented. fermentation of lactose in control milk was accompanied by the release of free galactose, with the result that carbohydrate utilization was less efficient than  in treated milk. this phenomenon also occurred when lactose was fermented by s. thermophilus in broth culture. carbohydrate utilization by the mixed yogurt culture was more rapid when the lactose in milk was partially prehydrolyzed. our  results suggest that the more rapid acid development that took place when a mixed yogurt starter culture was grown in milk containing prehydrolyzed lactose was the result of a more rapid and efficient utilization of carbohydrate by s. thermophilus when free glucose in addition to lactose was available for fermentation. the evidence presented also suggests that uptake and utilization of glucose and lactose by s. thermophilus are different in broth and milk cultures.

TI  == arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  == bacterial cell walls from str. bovis, str. lactis, str. mutans, str. thermophilus, str. salivarius, and str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. s. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. it was also shown that cell  walls from s. epidermidis, b. megaterium, and m. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. a close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the ppd hypersensitivity. it was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.

TI  == microorganisms and characteristics of laban.
AB  == laban had a titratable acidity of about 1.0%, a ph of 4.25, an ethanol content of 1.25%, and contained 4.2 mug acetaldehyde and 34 mug acetoin/ml. there was no diacetyl. five microorganisms, classified as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, leuconostoc lactis, kluyveromyces fragilis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae, were responsible for the fermentation. streptococcus thermophilus and l. acidophilus were responsible for acid production with s. thermophilus producing acid more rapidly. most of the acetaldehyde was produced by k. fragilis, little ethanol was found in absence of s. cerevisiae, and the acetoin was producted by s. thermophilus.

TI  == [development and resistance of staphylococci in bulgaricus milk].
AB  == studied was the dynamics of development of 9 strains of staphilococci isolated from humans and animals, kept in heat-treated milk, and their resistance in bulgarian sour milk. it was established that the pathogenic staph. aureus and staph. epidermidis develop will in fresh milk kept up to 7 days at 2--6degreesc and 18--22degreesc. in the production of bulgarian sour milk staph, aureus was shown to be viable, remaining active for seven days at 2 to 6degreesc. at room temperature (18--22degreesc) the survival rate has been dependent on the dynamics of accumulating metabolite products in connection with the development of lactobac. bulgaricum and streptococcus thermophilus. when the total acidity value reaches 160degreest the pathogenic staphylococci are destroyed. staphylococcus epidermidis finds no favourable medium to develop in bulgarian sour milk, and it  perishes when the total acidity is 120degreest and ph -- 3.

TI  == binding of the fluorescent probes 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate and n-phenyl-1-naphthylamine to bacteria.
AB  == changes in fluorescence intensities in pseudomonas fluorescens, escherichia coli, streptococcus thermophilus, and bacillus subtilis were investigated by means of the fluorescence probes (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate and n-phenyl-1-naphthylamine) during a temperature programmed run. a decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed in all investigated organisms when the temperature was elevated from 4 to about 40 degrees c. a strong increase in fluorescence intensity was found in gram-negative ps. fluorescens and e. coli when the temperature was elevated over 40 degrees c. on the other hand, only a slight enhancement in fluorescence intensities was observed in gram-positive str. thermophilus and b. subtilis when the lipid specific dye npn was applied at elevated temperatures. discontinuities in all the fluorescence temperature profiles were found between 20 and 30 degrees c in the case of both ans and npn.  with ans the fluorescence profiles turned upwards and with npn downwards after the inflection points. the effects of kcl, nh4cl, nacl and licl on ans binding differed from those detected for npn. saturation of probe binding was reached at  lower salt concentrations in the case of npn than ans, but depended somewhat on temperature.

TI  == [influence of some factors on the quality of bulgarian sour milk].
AB  == the results obtained with three feeding experiments revealed that combined forages containing biovit-40 are effective in that the antibiotic is not excreted with cow's milk and it does not inhibit the development of lactic acid fermentation. the season of the year associated with the passage of a given type  of feed on to another type was found to influence the course of the lactic acid fermentation as follows: --in feeding green mass in the summer period there is a  stimulation of the development of lactobacillus bulgaricum and str. thermophilus  in the milk; -- in feeding greater amounts of succulent forages in the winter, spring, and autumn periods there is a retardation in the development of the same  organisms in the milk.

TI  == susceptibility of cheese and yoghurt starter bacteria to antibiotics.
AB  == eight single-strain lactic streptococci, three commercial cheese starters, and six lactic acid bacteria isolated from yoghurt were examined for their susceptibility to penicillin, cloxacillin, tetracycline-hydrochloride and streptomycin. the ranges of the antibiotics causing 50% inhibition of the bacteria were (mug/ml): penicillin, 0.009 to 0.20; cloxacillin, 0.24 to 2.50; tetracycline, 0.09 to 0.60; and streptomycin, 0.35 to 13.0. the average concentrations required to cause 50 and 100% inhibition of the cheese starters were (mug/ml): penicillin, 0.12 and 0.26; cloxacillin, 1.91 and 3.9; tetracycline-hydrochloride, 0.13 and 0.36; and streptomycin, 0.59 and 2.06. all the cocci were about equally susceptible to tetracycline, and all organisms were  more resistant to cloxacillin than penicillin. the yoghurt isolates were more resistant to streptomycin and more susceptible to penicillin than the cheese starters. the 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride test, using streptococcus thermophilus bc as assay organism, does not detect low levels of streptomycin in  milk. however, it is useful in detecting cloxacillin residues.
