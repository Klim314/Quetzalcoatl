TI  == requirement of the lactobacillus casei maekr two-component system for l-malic acid utilization via a malic enzyme pathway.
AB  == lactobacillus casei can metabolize l-malic acid via malolactic enzyme (malolactic fermentation [mlf]) or malic enzyme (me). whereas utilization of l-malic acid via mlf does not support growth, the me pathway enables l. casei to grow on l-malic acid. in this work, we have identified in the genomes of l. casei strains bl23 and atcc 334 a cluster consisting of two diverging operons, maepe and maekr, encoding a putative malate transporter (maep), an me (maee), and a two-component  (tc) system belonging to the citrate family (maek and maer). homologous clusters  were identified in enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus uberis. our results show that me is essential for l-malic acid utilization in l. casei. furthermore, deletion of either the gene encoding the histidine kinase or the response regulator of the tc system resulted in the loss of the ability to grow on l-malic acid, thus indicating that the cognate tc system regulates and is essential for the expression of me. transcriptional analyses showed that expression of maee is induced in the presence of l-malic acid and repressed by glucose, whereas tc system expression was induced by l-malic acid and was not repressed by glucose. dnase i footprinting analysis showed that maer binds specifically to a set of direct repeats [5'-ttatt(a/t)aa-3'] in the mae promoter region. the location of the repeats strongly suggests that maer activates the expression of the diverging operons maepe and maekr where the first one is also subjected to carbon catabolite repression.

TI  == suppression of antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation by gram-positive bacterial cell walls.
AB  == it is largely unknown how bacterial cell walls (bcw) modulate human immune responses. in the present work the effect of gram-positive bcw on lymphocyte proliferation responses towards several microbial antigens (ag) or mitogens was studied. gram-positive bcw were derived from four indigenous bacterial strains and from one pathogen (streptococcus pyogenes). all bcw preparations used non-specifically suppressed the proliferation responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) against bacterial and viral ag, but not against mitogens. both lymphocytes and macrophages or their secreted products mediated the suppressive effects of bcw, which were not il-10 dependent. furthermore, the  expression of hla-dr and cd86 on monocytes/macrophages was downregulated by bcw.  unlike in lps-induced suppression, the cd14 pathway was not used by bcw of lactobacillus casei (l.c.). the observed results indicate that gram-positive bcw  suppress antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation through several mechanisms. this non-specific immunosuppression might be a general function of bcw in the bacteria-host interaction, being of importance for bacterial survival and pathogenicity.

TI  == mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

TI  == lactobacillus casei acquires the binding activity to fibronectin by the expression of the fibronectin binding domain of streptococcus pyogenes on the cell surface.
AB  == fibronectin binding domain was expressed on the cell surface of lactobacillus casei strain shirota which hardly adheres to fibronectin. dna for the fibronectin binding domain of the sfbl gene, which encodes a fibronectin binding protein of streptococcus pyogenes atcc 21059, was amplified with polymerase chain reaction,  cloned into a surface display vector psak332, and introduced into l. casei. the fibronectin binding domain was expressed as a fusion protein consisting of staphylokinase of staphylococcus aureus and the anchor sequence of cell wall-associated 763 proteinase of lactococcus lactis ncdo 763. the fibronectin binding ability of the resulting l. casei was confirmed with western blot analysis, immunoelectron microscopic analysis, and adherence to fibroblast cells. these results indicate that l. casei has acquired a new phenotype to bind fibronectin upon the expression of the fibronectin binding domain on the cell surface. this l. casei also shows binding affinity to fibrinogen, indicating that fibronectin binding domain is involved in the binding to fibrinogen as well.

TI  == human cytokine responses induced by gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the normal microbiota plays an important role in the health of the host, but little is known of how the human immune system recognizes and responds to gram-positive indigenous bacteria. we have investigated cytokine responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to gram-positive cell walls (cw) derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens  (eu.a. ), eubacterium limosum (eu.l.), lactobacillus casei (l.c.), and lactobacillus fermentum (l.f.). our results indicate that gram-positive cw of the normal intestinal microbiota can induce cytokine responses of the human pbmc. the profile, level and kinetics of these responses are similar to those induced by lipopolysaccharide (lps) or cw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (s.p.). bacterial cw are capable of inducing production of a proinflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, il-10, but not that of il-4 or interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma). monocytes  are the main cell population in pbmc to produce tnf-alpha and il-10. induction of cytokine secretion is serum-dependent; both cd14-dependent and -independent pathways are involved. these findings suggest that the human cytokine responses induced by gram-positive cw of the normal intestinal microbiota are similar to those induced by lps or gram-positive cw of the pathogens.

TI  == efficient secretion of the model antigen m6-gp41e in lactobacillus plantarum ncimb 8826.
AB  == four lactobacillus strains (lb. plantarum ncimb 8826, lb. paracasei lbtgs1.4, lb. casei atcc 393 and lb. fermentum kld) were tested for their ability to produce and secrete heterologous proteins. these strains were first screened with an alpha-amylase reporter under the control of a set of expression or expression/secretion signals from various lactic acid bacteria. with most of the  constructions tested, the level of extracellular production was highest in lb. plantarum ncimb 8826, and lowest in lb. paracasei lbtgs1.4. these two strains were next assayed using a model antigen consisting of the n-terminal part of the  m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes fused to the linear epitope eldkwas from human immunodeficiency virus gp41 protein. secretion of this heterologous protein was inefficient in lb. paracasei lbtgs1.4, which accumulated a large intracellular pool of the unprocessed precursor, whereas lb. plantarum ncimb 8826 was able to secrete the antigen to a level as high as 10 mg l-1.

TI  == induction of endogenous tnf production by biological response modifiers and bacterial preparations.
AB  == this review summarizes experiments on the endogenous induction of tumor necrosis  factor (tnf) in mice by various biological response modifiers and bacterial preparations, such as heat-killed streptococcus pyogenes (ok-432) or lactobacillus casei (lc). intravenous administration of ok-432 or lc transiently  elicited endogenous tnf in mice. the endogenous tnf production was significantly  enhanced by priming (pretreatment) with high molecular-weight lignins or polysaccharides, but not by phenylpropenoid precursors or partially hydrolyzed products of glucans. when stimulated with lignins and ok-432, tumor-bearing and aged mice produced much lower amounts of tnf than normal and young mice. endogenously produced tnf was concentrated more in serum, liver and lungs, than in other organs. on the other hand, a much lower concentration of il-1alpha was induced in the serum fraction, whereas significant amounts of this cytokine were  detected in liver and lungs. histochemical examination revealed significant increase in the number and swelling of kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelium in the liver of the treated mice. the results suggest the possible efficacy of applying endogenous tnf production for the treatment of human cancer patients.

TI  == the protective activity of immunostimulants against listeria monocytogenes infection in mice.
AB  == the function of peritoneal macrophages induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of attenuated streptococcus pyogenes (ok-432), bacillus calmette guerin (bcg), protein-bound polysaccharide preparation isolated from coriolus vesicolor  (psk) or lactobacillus casei was examined. the pma-triggered respiratory burst (production of o2- and h2o2) of macrophages induced by ok-432, bcg or lac. casei  was greater than that of resident or thioglycollate-stimulated macrophages and was similar to that of bcg-activated macrophages. psk failed to enhance the production of o2- or h2o2 by macrophages. alkaline phosphodiesterase (apd) activity was reduced in macrophages induced by ok-432, bcg or lac. casei injection and in bcg-activated macrophages. the apd activity of macrophages obtained 7 and 13 days after i.p. injection of psk was elevated, as with thioglycollate-stimulated macrophages. listericidal activity in vitro was enhanced in macrophages obtained in 13 and 7 days, but suppressed in macrophages  obtained 2 days after ok-432, bcg or lac. casei injection. lac. casei administered either 2 or 13 days before infection with listeria monocytogenes was protective but ok-432, bcg (0.1 mg) and psk were not, even though they were able  to stimulate macrophage function.

TI  == further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == acute joint inflammation in mice after systemic injection of the cell wall, its peptidoglycan, and chemically defined peptidoglycan subunits from various bacteria.
AB  == the systemic injection of an aqueous suspension of cell wall or its peptidoglycan (pg)-rich sonicate derived from group a streptococcus and lactobacillus casei induced acute joint lesions in balb/c, dba/1j, (balb/c x dba/1j)f1, and c3h/he mouse strains, but not in c57bl/6, dba/2, and akr strains. cell walls and their enzymatically degraded pg fragments from other bacteria as well as the synthetic  disaccharide dipeptide and lactobacillus plantarum cell wall-derived disaccharide tripeptide produced similar acute inflammation in susceptible balb/c mice. acute  swelling and erythema of the ankles and wrists were observed as early as 3 h, reached maximum severity by day 2, and generally subsided by days 4 to 6 after injection. histological studies showed synovial proliferation, marked infiltration of many mononuclear cells and a few polymorphonuclear leukocytes in  the soft tissues, and extensive deposition of fibrinous exudate in the joint space. antibody response was detectable against the pg fraction. however, anti-pg antibody does not seem to be responsible for the pathogenesis of this disease. on the other hand, experiments on decomplementation by cobra venom factor suggest that complement components are involved in the early phase of this arthritic model.

TI  == streptococcal phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system: purification  and characterization of a phosphoprotein phosphatase which hydrolyzes the phosphoryl bond in seryl-phosphorylated histidine-containing protein.
AB  == histidine-containing protein (hpr) of gram-positive bacteria was found to be phosphorylated at a seryl residue (p-ser-hpr) in an atp-dependent reaction catalyzed by a protein kinase (j. deutscher and m. h. saier, jr., proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 80:6790-6794, 1983). here we describe the purification and characterization of a soluble enzyme of streptococcus faecalis which splits the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr. the enzyme has a molecular weight of ca. 7.5 x 10(4), as determined by its migration behavior on a sephacryl s-200 column. on native polyacrylamide gels the purified enzyme produced only one protein band. on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels we found one major protein band of molecular weight 2.9 x 10(4) and two minor protein bands of molecular weights 2.3 x 10(4) and 7 x 10(4). fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which stimulated the atp-dependent, protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of hpr, had no effect on  the phosphatase activity. other glycolytic intermediates also had no effect. however, inorganic phosphate, which inhibited the atp-dependent hpr kinase, stimulated the p-ser-hpr phosphatase. edta at a concentration of 0.1 mm completely inhibited the phosphatase. divalent cations like mg2+, mn2+, and co2+  overcame the inhibition by edta. fe2+, zn2+, and cu2+ had no effect, whereas ca2+ slightly inhibited the phosphatase. atp was also found to inhibit the phosphatase. under conditions in which atp severely inhibited the phosphatase, adp was found to have no effect on the enzyme activity. besides p-ser-hpr of s. faecalis, the phosphatase was also able to hydrolyze the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr of streptococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactobacillus casei. phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside phosphorylation, catalyzed by the s. aureus phosphoenolpyruvate:lactose phosphotransferase system, was about 150-fold  decreased in the presence of p-ser-hpr of s. aureus, as compared with hpr. however, when p-ser-hpr was first incubated with p-ser-hpr phosphatase to allow complete hydrolysis of the phosphoryl bond, it had the same activity as hpr. besides this cytoplasmic phosphoprotein phosphatase, we detected a membrane-bound phosphatase which also hydrolyzed the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr.

TI  == binding of streptococcal antigens to muscle tissue in vitro.
AB  == antigens extracted from cells of streptococcus pyogenes t6 and streptococcus mutans strains aht, bht, 10449, omz175, and k1r adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. similar preparations from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. serological cross-reactivity was observed between the  tissue-binding factors of s. pyogenes and s. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. in a comparative study of extraction procedures, the  greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group a streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees c. hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-s. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated  cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. the heart-binding component of s. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease  digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. the capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents.
