TI  == dap-decarboxylase activity and lysine production by rumen bacteria.
AB  == the last step of pathway of lysine biosynthesis by rumen bacteria was tested. the first measurements of dap-decarboxylase activity and of lysine production by megasphera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium, clostridium spp., butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and bacteroides succinogenes as well as the first attempts to increase the lysine production by ruminal streptococci by mutation are described. the highest values were measured in selenomonas ruminantium (dap-decarboxylase activity = 146 micrograms dap.min-1.mg-1 protein and lysine production was 390 micrograms.mg-1 protein) and the lowest values were ascertained in butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (dap-decarboxylase activity = 27 micrograms dap.min-1.mg-1 protein and lysine production was 32 micrograms.mg-1 protein). dap-decarboxylase activity was increased by mutation especially in streptococcus bovis, the lysine production in both of tested ruminal streptococci. the potential use of lysine-excreting mutants in calves in future is suggested.
