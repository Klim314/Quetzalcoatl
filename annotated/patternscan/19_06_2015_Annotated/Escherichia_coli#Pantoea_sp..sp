TI  == screening of the novel colicinogenic gram-negative rods against pathogenic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == purpose: escherichia coli (e. coli) o157:h7 is gram-negative enteric pathogen producing different types of shiga toxin. this bacterium is the most corporate cause of haemorrhagic colitis in human. administration of antibiotics (particularly sulfa drugs) against this pathogen is a debatable topic as this may increase the risk of uremic syndrome; especially in children and aged people. around the world, microbiologists are in search of alternative therapeutic methods specially probiotics against this pathogen. in the present study, we have focused on the investigation of alternate bio-therapeutics (probiotics) for the treatment of patients infected with e. coli o157:h7. this study is based on the identification of colicin-producing gram-negative bacteria (particularly enterobacteriaceae) which can competently exclude e. coli o157:h7 from the gut of the infected individual. materials and methods: hundred samples from human, animal faeces and septic tank water were analysed for nonpathogenic gram-negative rods (gnrs). results: out of these samples, 175 isolates of gnrs were checked for their activity against e. coli o157:h7. only 47 isolates inhibited the growth of  e. coli o157:h7, among which majority were identified as e. coli. these e. coli strains were found to be the efficient producers of colicin. some of the closely  related species i. e., citrobacter sp, pantoea sp. and kluyvera sp. also showed considerable colicinogenic activity. moreover, colicinogenic species were found to be nonhaemolytic, tolerant to acidic environment (ph 3) and sensitive to commonly used antibiotics. conclusion: nonhaemolytic, acid tolerant and sensitive to antibiotics suggests the possible use of these circulating endothelial cells (cec) as inexpensive and inoffensive therapeutic agent (probiotics) in e. coli o157:h7 infections.

TI  == microbial diversity observed during hemp retting.
AB  == historically used in textile and paper industry, hemp fibres have started to find new applications in composite materials with important economic and ecological advantages. however, their applications are limited since manufacturers have some difficulties to standardise fabrication processes. this study is a first step before selection and isolation of strains that could later be used to optimise microbial retting efficiency and hence fibre quality. we studied six samples harvested on different ground types, at different dates and with different retting durations on field to obtain an exhaustive representation of the process. after dna extraction, total bacteria and fungi associated with stems during retting were specifically quantified using real-time pcr. then, using sequence analysis of randomly cloned 16s and 18s ribosomal rna (rrna) genes, a phylogenetic characterisation of the dominant microorganisms was carried out. quantitatively, we showed that there were 8.1-9.5 log10 16s rrna gene copies per  gram of hemp straw for bacteria and 8.6-9.6 log10 18s rrna gene copies per gram for fungi. qualitatively, we noticed a higher bacterial diversity in comparison to fungi. this work showed that in the different samples, the same species were present but in significantly different proportions according to ground type, harvest dates and retting durations on field. the most frequent bacterial sequences were affiliated to species escherichia coli, pantoea agglomerans, pseudomonas rhizosphaerae, rhodobacter sp., pseudomonas fulva, rhizobium huautlense and massilia timonae, whereas fungal sequences were principally related to the genera cladosporium and cryptococcus.

TI  == microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  == this paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in olsztyn, poland. heterotrophic plate counts (hpc22, hpc37), enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and  clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6),  3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)cfu/g, respectively. it was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater  than those obtained by the cultivation method. among identified enterobacteriaceae, pantoea spp. and enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. pathogenic bacteria of the genus salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when e. coli were absent. bacteria from staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)cfu/g. aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria and trichoderma genera were  most numerous among molds, whereas trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from  sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. potentially pathogenic bacteria of the  genus salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when toxocara and e. coli were absent. it seems that assessing the contamination of children's  play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes  and may not fully reflect their safety for children.

TI  == pantoea sp. isolated from tropical fresh water exhibiting n-acyl homoserine lactone production.
AB  == n-acyl homoserine lactone (ahl) serves as signaling molecule for quorum sensing (qs) in gram-negative bacteria to regulate various physiological activities including pathogenicity. with the aim of isolating freshwater-borne bacteria that can cause outbreak of disease in plants and portrayed qs properties, environmental water sampling was conducted. here we report the preliminary screening of ahl production using chromobacterium violaceum cv026 and escherichia coli [psb401] as ahl biosensors. the 16s rdna gene sequence of isolate m009 showed the highest sequence similarity to pantoea stewartii s9-116, which is a plant pathogen. the isolated pantoea sp. was confirmed to produce n-3-oxohexanoyl-l-hsl (3-oxo-c6-hsl) through analysis of high resolution mass tandem mass spectrometry.

TI  == the astaxanthin dideoxyglycoside biosynthesis pathway in sphingomonas sp. pb304.
AB  == a major carotenoid in sphingomonas sp. pb304, originally isolated from a river in daejon city, south korea, was identified as astaxanthin dideoxyglycoside. gene clusters encoding the astaxanthin dideoxyglycoside biosynthetic enzymes were identified by screening sphingomonas sp. pb304 fosmid libraries using degenerate  probes that harbor highly conserved sequences from the sphigomonas elodea-derived crti and nostoc sp. pcc 7120-dervied crtw genes. selected positive gene clusters  were fully sequenced and annotated, revealing genes encoding six putative carotenogenic enzymes: phytoene synthase (crtb), phytoene desaturase (crti), lycopene cyclase (crty), carotene hydroxylase (crtz), carotene ketolase (crtw), and glycosyltransferase (crtx). all of the carotenogenic enzymes, except for crtx, were functional in the recombinant host escherichia coli expressing synthetic carotenogenic modules from pantoea agglomerans. crtx did not take up udp-glucose or gdp-fucose as sugar substrates during the in vitro reaction. although no direct experimental evidence was obtained for the function of sphingomonas sp. pb304 crtx, it can be categorized as a putative deoxyglycosyltransferase based on the presence of astaxanthin dideoxyglycoside in sphingomonas sp. pb304, a putative corresponding gene in the carotenoid biosynthetic gene cluster, and high amino acid sequence homology to the existing  glycosyltransferases. therefore, we propose that astaxanthin dideoxyglycoside can be synthesized in sphingomonas sp. pb304 via sequential reactions of six pathway  enzymes, including crtx on the phytoene intermediate.

TI  == functional characterization of the sucrose isomerase responsible for trehalulose  production in plant-associated pectobacterium species.
AB  == fifty-three plant-associated microorganisms were investigated for their ability to convert sucrose to its isomers. these microorganisms included one dickeya zeae isolate and 7 enterobacter, 3 pantoea, and 43 pectobacterium species. eleven out  of the 53 strains (21%) showed the ability to transform sucrose to isomaltulose and trehalulose. among those, pectobacterium carotovorum kkh 3-1 showed the highest bioconversion yield (97.4%) from sucrose to its isomers. in this strain,  the addition of up to 14% sucrose in the medium enhanced sucrose isomerase (siase) production. the siase activity at 14% sucrose (47.6 u/mg dcw) was about 3.6-fold higher than that of the negative control (13.3 u/mg dcw at 0% sucrose).  the gene encoding siase, which is comprised a 1776 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding 591 amino acids, was cloned from p. carotovorum kkh 3-1 and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant siase (pcsi) was shown to have optimum activity at ph 6.0 and 40 degrees c. the reaction temperature significantly affected the ratio of sucrose isomers produced by pcsi. the amount of trehalulose increased from 47.5% to 79.1% as temperature was lowered from 50 degrees c to 30 degrees c, implying that siase activity can be controlled by reaction temperature.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in isolated bacteria  from seawater of algiers beaches (algeria).
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate bacterial antibiotic resistance in seawater  from four beaches in algiers. the most significant resistance rates were observed for amoxicillin and ticarcillin, whereas they were relatively low for ceftazidime, cefotaxime and imipenem. according to sampling sites, the highest resistance rates were recorded for 2 sites subjected to chemical and microbiological inputs (amoxicillin, 43% and 52%; ticarcillin, 19.6% and 47.7%),  and for 2 sites relatively preserved from anthropogenic influence, resistance rates were lowest (amoxicillin, 1.5% and 16%; ticarcillin, 0.8% and 2.6%). thirty-four bacteria resistant to imipenem (n=14) or cefotaxime (n=20) were identified as pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=15), pseudomonas fluorescens (7), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), burkholderia cepacia (2), bordetella sp. (1), pantoea sp. (1), acinetobacter baumannii (1), chryseomonas luteola (1), ochrobactrum anthropi (1) and escherichia coli (1). screening for extended spectrum beta-lactamase showed the presence of ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase in the e.  coli isolate, and the encoding gene was transferable in association with the inci1 plasmid of about 50 kbp. insertion sequence isecp1b was located upstream of the ctx-m-15 gene. this work showed a significant level of resistance to antibiotics, mainly among environmental saprophytic bacteria. transmissible ctx-m-15 was detected in e. coli; this may mean that contamination of the environment by resistant bacteria may cause the spread of resistance genes.

TI  == a novel low-temperature-active beta-glucosidase from symbiotic serratia sp. tn49  reveals four essential positions for substrate accommodation.
AB  == a 2,373-bp full-length gene (bgla49) encoding a 790-residue polypeptide (bgla49)  with a calculated mass of 87.8 kda was cloned from serratia sp. tn49, a symbiotic bacterium isolated from the gut of longhorned beetle (batocera horsfieldi) larvae. the deduced amino acid sequence of bgla49 showed the highest identities of 80.1% with a conceptually translated protein from pantoea sp. at-9b (eew02556), 38.3% with the identified glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 3 beta-glucosidase from clostridium stercorarium ncbi 11754 (cab08072), and <15.0%  with the low-temperature-active gh 3 beta-glucosidases from shewanella sp. g5 (abl09836) and paenibacillus sp. c7 (aax35883). the recombinant enzyme (r-bgla49) was expressed in escherichia coli and displayed the typical characteristics of low-temperature-active enzymes, such as low temperature optimum (showing apparent optimal activity at 35 degrees c), activity at low temperatures (retaining approximately 60% of its maximum activity at 20 degrees c and approximately 25% at 10 degrees c). compared with the thermophilic gh 3 beta-glucosidase, r-bgla49  had fewer hydrogen bonds and salt bridges and less proline residues. these features might relate to the increased structure flexibility and higher catalytic activity at low temperatures of r-bgla49. the molecular docking study of four gh  3 beta-glucosidases revealed five conserved positions contributing to substrate accommodation, among which four positions of r-bgla49 (r192, y228, d260, and e449) were identified to be essential based on site-directed mutagenesis analysis.

TI  == biosynthesis of the vitamin e compound delta-tocotrienol in recombinant escherichia coli cells.
AB  == the biosynthesis of natural products in a fast growing and easy to manipulate heterologous host system, such as escherichia coli, is of increasing interest in  biotechnology. this procedure allows the investigation of complex natural product biosynthesis and facilitates the engineering of pathways. here we describe the cloning and the heterologous expression of tocochromanol (vitamin e) biosynthesis genes in e. coli. tocochromanols are synthesized solely in photosynthetic organisms (cyanobacteria, algae, and higher green plants). for recombinant tocochromanol biosynthesis, the genes encoding hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase  (hpd), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate synthase (crte), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate reductase (ggh), homogentisate phytyltransferase (hpt), and tocopherol-cyclase (cyc) were cloned in a stepwise fashion and expressed in e. coli. recombinant e.  coli cells were cultivated and analyzed for tocochromanol compounds and their biosynthesis precursors. the expression of only hpd from pseudomonas putida or crte from pantoea ananatis resulted in the accumulation of 336 mg l(-1) homogentisate and 84 microg l(-1) geranylgeranylpyrophosphate in e. coli cultures. simultaneous expression of hpd, crte, and hpt from synechocystis sp. under the control of single tac-promoter resulted in the production of methyl-6-geranylgeranyl-benzoquinol (67.9 microg g(-1)). additional expression of the tocopherol cyclase gene vte1 from arabidopsis thaliana resulted in the novel  formation of a vitamin e compound-delta-tocotrienol (15 microg g(-1))-in e. coli.

TI  == confirmation of e. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  == paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. some are rich in wood  fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their  coliform microflora. therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. for the first series of analyses, the medium used was colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to  isolate bacteria in pure culture on macconkey agar. in a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase  activities, were used to isolate bacteria. first, the presence of thermotolerant  coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 mpn/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. from this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on macconkey medium and identified as citrobacter freundii, enterobacter sp, e. sakazakii, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, k. pneumoniae subsp.  ozaenae, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, pantoea sp, raoultella terrigena, r. planticola. second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 mpn/g (d.w) sludge, whereas e. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 mpn/g (d.w.) sludge. the presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and e. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in  large quantities. also, indigenous e. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated e. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. in this second series of isolations, api20e and biolog identified most isolates as e. coli, but others remained unidentified. the sequences of the 16s rdna confirmed that most isolates were likely e. coli, few burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. this study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.

TI  == characterization of bacterial beta-carotene 3,3'-hydroxylases, crtz, and p450 in  astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway and adonirubin production by gene combination in escherichia coli.
AB  == beta-carotene hydroxylase (crtz) is one of rate-limiting enzymes for astaxanthin  production. a complementation analysis was conducted using escherichia coli transformants to compare the catalytic efficiency of bacterial crtz from brevundimonas sp. sd212, paracoccus sp. pc1 (formerly known as alcaligenes sp. pc-1), paracoccus sp. n81106 (agrobacterium aurantiacum), pantoea ananatis (erwinia uredovora 20d3), marine bacterium p99-3, and p450 monooxygenase (cyp175a1) from thermus thermophilus hb27. each crtz or cyp175a1 gene was expressed in e. coli transformants synthesizing canthaxanthin and beta-carotene due to the respective presence of plasmids pac-cantha and paccar16deltacrtx. the  carotenoids that accumulated in the resulting recombinant e. coli cells were examined by chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses. e. coli carrying brevundimonas sp. sd212 crtz showed the highest astaxanthin production efficiency among the transformants examined, while there was no significant difference in the catalytic efficiency for conversion from beta-carotene to zeaxanthin. recombinant e. coli expressing the cyp175a1 gene, in addition to the genes for canthaxanthin synthesis, surprisingly accumulated adonirubin (phoenicoxanthin) as the main product, although the other recombinant e. coli did not accumulate any adonirubin. the present results suggest that the brevundimonas sp. sd212 crtz and t. thermophilus hb27 cyp175a1 genes could, respectively, be used for the efficient production of astaxanthin and adonirubin in heterologous hosts.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == cloning and expression of glucose 3-dehydrogenase from halomonas sp. alpha-15 in  escherichia coli.
AB  == the gene encoding glucose 3-dehydrogenase (g3dh) from halomonas sp. alpha-15 was  cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. an open reading frame of 1686 nucleotides was shown to encode g3dh. the flavine adenine dinucleotide binding motif was found in the n-terminal region of g3dh. the deduced primary structure of g3dh showed about 30% identity to sorbitol dehydrogenase from gluconobacter oxydans and 2-keto-d-gluconate dehydrogenases from erwinia herbicola and pantoea  citrea. the folding prediction of g3dh suggested that the 3d structure of g3dh was similar with cholesterol oxidase from brevibacterium sterolicum or glucose oxidase from aspergillus niger.

TI  == erwinia pyrifoliae sp. nov., a novel pathogen that affects asian pear trees (pyrus pyrifolia nakai)
AB  == a novel pathogen from asian pears (pyrus pyrifolia nakai) was analysed by sequencing the 16s rdna and the adjacent intergenic region, and the data were compared to related enterobacteriaceae. the 16s rdna of the asian pear pathogen was almost identical with the sequence of erwinia amylovora, in contrast to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region of both species. a dendrogram was deduced from determined sequences of the spacer regions including those of several related species such as erwinia amylovora, enterobacter pyrinus, pantoea  stewartii subsp. stewartii and escherichia coli. dendrograms derived from 121 biochemical characteristics including biotype 100 data placed the asian pear pathogen close to erwinia amylovora and more distantly to other members of the species erwinia and to the species pantoea and enterobacter. another dna relatedness study was performed by dna hybridizations and estimation of delta tm  values. the asian pear strains constituted a tight dna hybridization group (89-100%) and were barely related to strains of erwinia amylovora (40-50%) with a delta tm in the range of 5.2-6.8. the g + c content of dna from the novel pathogen is 52 mol%. therefore, it is proposed that strains isolated from asian pears constitute a new species and the name erwinia pyrifoliae is suggested; the  type strain is strain ep 16/96t (= cfbp 4172t = dsm 12163t).
