TI  == a methodological approach to screen diverse cheese-related bacteria for their ability to produce aroma compounds.
AB  == microorganisms play an important role in the development of cheese flavor. the aim of this study was to develop an approach to facilitate screening of various cheese-related bacteria for their ability to produce aroma compounds. we combined i) curd-based slurry medium incubated under conditions mimicking cheese manufacturing and ripening, ii) powerful method of extraction of volatiles, headspace trap, coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (hs-trap-gc-ms),  and iii) metabolomics-based method of data processing using the xcms package of r software and multivariate analysis. this approach was applied to eleven species:  five lactic acid bacteria (leuconostoc lactis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus helveticus), four actinobacteria (brachybacterium articum, brachybacterium tyrofermentans, brevibacterium aurantiacum, and microbacterium gubbeenense), propionibacterium freudenreichii, and hafnia alvei. all the strains grew, with maximal populations  ranging from 7.4 to 9.2 log (cfu/ml). in total, 52 volatile aroma compounds were  identified, of which 49 varied significantly in abundance between bacteria. principal component analysis of volatile profiles differentiated species by their ability to produce ethyl esters (associated with brachybacteria), sulfur compounds and branched-chain alcohols (h. alvei), branched-chain acids (h. alvei, p. freudenreichii and l. paracasei), diacetyl and related carbonyl compounds (m.  gubbeenense and l. paracasei), among others.

TI  == specific metabolic activity of ripening bacteria quantified by real-time reverse  transcription pcr throughout emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  == bacterial communities of fermented foods are usually investigated by culture-dependent methods. real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) and reverse transcription (rt)-qpcr offer new possibilities to quantify the populations present and their metabolic activity. the aim of this work was to develop qpcr and rt-qpcr methods to assess the metabolic activity and the stress level of the  two species used as ripening cultures in emmental cheese manufacture, propionibacterium freudenreichii and lactobacillus paracasei. three small scale (1/100) microbiologically controlled emmental cheeses batches were manufactured and inoculated with lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, p. freudenreichii and l. paracasei. at 12 steps of cheese manufacture and ripening,  the populations of p. freudenreichii and l. paracasei were quantified by numerations on agar media and by qpcr. 16s, tuf and grol transcript levels were quantified by rt-qpcr. sampling was carried out in triplicate. qpcr and rt-qpcr assessments were specific, efficient and linear. the quantification limit was 10(3) copies of cells or cdna/g of cheese. cell quantifications obtained by qpcr  gave similar results than plate count for p. freudenreichii growth and 0.5 to 1 log lower in the stationary phase. bacterial counts and qpcr quantifications showed that l. paracasei began to grow during the pressing step while p. freudenreichii began to grow from the beginning of ripening (in the cold room). tuf cdna quantification results suggested that metabolic activity of l. paracasei reached a maximum during the first part of the ripening (in cold room) and decreased progressively during ripening (in the warm room). metabolic activity of p. freudenreichii was maximum at the end of cold ripening room and was stable during the first two weeks in warm room. after lactate exhaustion (after two weeks of warm room), the number of tuf cdna decreased reflecting reduced metabolic activity. for l. paracasei, grol cdna were stable during ripening. for  p. freudenreichii, grol1 gene was highly-expressed during acidification, while grol2 gene highly expression was only observed at the end of the ripening stage after lactate (carbon substrate of p. freudenreichii) exhaustion. the potential use of 16s and tuf genes for the normalization of cdna quantification throughout  an emmental cheese manufacture is discussed. for the first time, specific gene expression was performed by rt-qpcr yielding metabolic activity and stress response evaluation for l. paracasei and p. freudenreichii in cheese.

TI  == effects of copper supplement on growth and viability of strains used as starters  and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  == aims: to determine the effects of supplemented copper (cu2+) on growth and viability of strains used as starters and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture. methods and results: thirteen strains belonging to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus or propionibacterium freudenreichii species were exposed to various  copper concentrations in the proper growth medium at relevant growth temperatures, and the effects of supplemented copper on bacterial growth and cell viability were determined by optical density and ph measurements, also by platings. among the species considered, l. delbrueckii was the most copper resistant and s. thermophilus the most sensitive to copper. anaerobic conditions  increased this sensitivity significantly. there was also a considerable amount of variation in copper resistance at strain level. conclusions: copper resistance is both a species- and strain-dependent property and may reflect variability in copper-binding capacities by cell wall components among species and strains. in addition, the chemical state of copper may be involved. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed that copper resistance is a highly variable property among starter and adjunct strains, and this variability should be considered when strains are selected for emmental cheese manufacture.

TI  == survey of bacterial proteins released in cheese: a proteomic approach.
AB  == during the ripening of emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. in emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters  like lactobacillus helveticus, lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as propionibacterium freudenreichii. the aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a  reference map. a methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of  cheese matrix prior to 2d-page analysis. the aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) dna and rna repair and (v) oxidoreduction. the results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria  and propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening. different peptidases arose from st thermophilus and lb helveticus, suggesting that streptococci are involved in peptide degradation in addition to the proteolytic activity of lactobacilli.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus helveticus and propionibacterium freudenrichii ssp. shermanii combinations on propensity for split defect in swiss cheese.
AB  == one of the least controlled defects in swiss cheese is development of splits that appear during refrigerated storage after cheese is removed from the warm room. such fissures, or cracks, in the body of the cheese can be as short as 1 cm, or long enough to span a 90-kg block. a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment was used to determine the effect of different lactobacillus helveticus/propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii starter culture combinations on the occurrence of split defect in swiss cheese. eights vats of cheese were made in summer and eight in winter. each 90-kg block of cheese was cut into twenty-four 4-kg blocks and graded based on the presence of splits. only small variations were found in the composition of cheeses made during the same season. there were no correlations between moisture, ph, fat, protein, calcium, lactose contents, d/l lactate ratio, or protein degradation that could be used to predict splits after 90 d of storage. however, cheese made in the summer had 2% higher moisture content and a  greater prevalence of splits. there was a sixfold increase in amount of downgraded cheese between the best and worst culture combinations used during cheese manufacture. after 90-d storage, 14 to 90% of cheese had splits in the summer, and 1 to 6% in the winter. split formation increased with time from 60 to 120 d of storage and extent of split formation was influenced by both the lactobacilli and propionibacteria cultures used.

TI  == efficient mechanical disruption of lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis and propionibacterium freudenreichii by a new high-pressure homogenizer and recovery of intracellular aminotransferase activity.
AB  == microbiological studies often involve bacterial cell fractionation, which is known to be difficult for gram-positive as compared to gram-negative bacteria. our purpose was to test the breaking efficiency of a new high-pressure pilot homogenizer for three gram-positive species involved in dairy technology and to assess the activity of an intracellular aminotransferase. varied pressures (50, 100 and 200 mpa) were applied to concentrated bacterial suspensions (1.2 mg dry weight/ml) of lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis and propionibacterium  freudenreichii. breaking efficiency was estimated by decreases in optical density at 650 nm, cellular dry weight and viability. the proteins released were quantified and the residual intracellular aminotransferase activity was estimated using leucine as substrate. one run at 50 mpa was sufficient to break 80% of lactobacilli cells whereas 200 mpa were required for the same efficiency for l. lactis and p. freudenreichii. whatever the pressure, leucine aminotransferase activity was recovered in the supernatant after cell breaking. this new high-pressure pilot homogenizer can allow rapid (20 s/run), easy, continuous and  highly efficient cell breaking for intracellular enzyme recovery or other purposes. as the species tested were not phylogenetically related, and had different morphologies and cell wall compositions, we conclude that most gram-positive bacteria may be broken efficiently by this new device.

TI  == genetic diversity in swiss cheese starter cultures assessed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and arbitrarily primed pcr.
AB  == aims: to assess intraspecific genetic heterogeneity among commercial swiss cheese starter culture strains of lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus and propionibacterium freudenreichii and to compare the efficacy of two genetic typing methods. methods and results: two genetic typing methods, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr), were used. nine strep. thermophilus strains revealed eight pfge and five ap-pcr genotypes. seventeen lactobacillus strains yielded 16 and five genotypes by pfge and ap-pcr, respectively. eleven propionibacterium strains yielded 10 pfge genotypes. cluster analysis of pfge profiles generated similarity coefficients for strep. thermophilus, lact. helveticus and prop. freudenreichii strains of 29.5%, 60.3%,  and 30.5%, respectively. milk acidification rates for strep. thermophilus and lact. helveticus were determined. conclusions: pulsed field gel electrophoresis is more discriminatory than ap-pcr. the lact. helveticus group is more homogeneous than the other species examined. strains with > 87% similarity by pfge consistently had the same acidification rate and ap-pcr profile. significance and impact of the study: bacterial strains sold for swiss cheese manufacture in the united states are genetically diverse. clustering of genetically related bacteria may be useful in identifying new strains with industrially relevant traits.

TI  == autolysis and related proteolysis in swiss cheese for two lactobacillus helveticus strains.
AB  == intracellular peptidases of lactobacillus helveticus may play a major role in the proteolysis of swiss cheeses, provided that they are released through bacterial lysis. experimental swiss cheeses were manufactured on a small scale from thermized and microfiltered milk using as starters (in addition to streptococcus  thermophilus and propionibacterium freudenreichii) one of two lb. helveticus strains, itglh1 and itglh77, which undergo lysis to different extents in vitro. all the cheeses were biochemically identical after pressing. the viability of lb. helveticus itglh1 and itglh77 decreased to a similar extent (96-98%) while in the cold room, but the concomitant release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase in  cheeses made with strain itglh1 was 5-7-fold that in cheeses made with itglh77. protein profiles and immunoblot detection of the dipeptidase pepd confirmed a greater degree of lysis of the itglh1 strain. free active peptidases were detected in aqueous extracts of cheese for both strains, and proteolysis occurred principally in the warm room. reversed-phase hplc revealed a more extensive peptide hydrolysis for itglh1, which was confirmed by the greater release of free nh2 groups (+33%) and free amino acids (+75%) compared with itglh77. as the intracellular peptidase activities of itglh1 and itglh77 have previously been shown to be similar, our results indicated that the extent of lysis of lb. helveticus could have a direct impact on the degree of proteolysis in swiss cheeses.

TI  == short-chain fatty acids modulate growth of lactobacilli in mixed culture fermentations with propionibacteria.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus (l. helveticus atcc 15009 and crl 581, and l casei lc 3) were paired with three strains of propionibacterium (p. freudenreichii ap8, p. freudenreichii gp6 and p. acidipropionici crl 756) and grown in individual and mixed cultures in a complex medium. bacterial growth, carbohydrate consumption, and production of acids was determined and compared after mono and binary culture. propionibacterium strains were inhibited in mixed cultures that rapidly  reached low ph values, and stimulated in those with slow ph reduction. in several pairs lactobacillus strains were stimulated by mixed cultivation, while in others they were unaffected or inhibited. lactic acid reduction by propionibacterium consumption was not always enough to produce a stimulatory effect on growth of lactobacilli. the behaviour of lactobacillus strains in individual cultures in media with propionic acid was similar to that of mixed cultures with propionibacterium. as propionic acid concentration increased in the medium and glucose was consumed, both individual and mixed cultures of lactobacilli showed inhibition of the growth and increase of the fermentation activity.
