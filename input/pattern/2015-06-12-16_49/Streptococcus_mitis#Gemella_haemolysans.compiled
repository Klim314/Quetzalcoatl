TI  - The predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  - PURPOSE: To detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. Cultures were made from clinical materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. RESULTS: The following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: Streptococcus milleri Group (SMG) (23.8%) [Streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and Streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], Streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), Streptococcus mitis (4.7%), Streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), Peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), Prevotella buccae (4.7%), Prevotella intermedia (4.7%), Actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), Propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), Bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), Staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), Rothia denticariosa (4.7%), Gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. It was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. Although no specific microorganism was found, Streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially SMG (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. Furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. Although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.
TI  - Occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  - The distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD, in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. ZmpB was ubiquitous in the Mitis and Salivarius groups of the genus Streptococcus and in the genera Gemella and Granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. IgA1 protease activity was observed in all members of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. oralis, S. sanguinis, and Gemella haemolysans, was variably present in S. mitis and S. infantis, and absent in S. gordonii, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, S. oligofermentans, S. australis, S. peroris, and S. suis. Phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpB, and zmpD genes in S. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. Presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. The widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpB, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. IMPORTANCE: The paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study maps the presence of the corresponding genes and enzyme activities in S. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera Streptococcus, Gemella, and Granulicatella. The distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpB is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. The ZmpB protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the Mitis and Salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. The relative sequence diversification of the IgA1 protease, ZmpB, and ZmpD is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen S. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.
TI  - Using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  - High throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. However, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. In this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. We then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity and biogeography patterns. Mock community analysis showed primer and DNA isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequencing of salivary and mucosal communities found a total of 455 OTUs (0.3% dissimilarity) with only 78 of these present in all subjects. We demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. With respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. These differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by the abundance of Streptococcus mitis and Gemella haemolysans in mucosa. In summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. Despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.
TI  - Molecular methodology to assess the impact of cancer chemotherapy on the oral bacterial flora: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This pilot study determined the profile of the oral bacterial flora in an outpatient cancer population before and after chemotherapy using molecular techniques. STUDY DESIGN: We recruited 9 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients scheduled for induction chemotherapy. All were seen immediately before chemotherapy, and 7 to 14 days later. At both visits, we performed oral evaluations and obtained mucositis grading (with the World Health Organization [WHO] scale), absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), and bacterial samples from the buccal mucosa. Bacterial DNA was isolated, and 16S ribosomal RNA gene clonal libraries were constructed. Sequences of genes in the library were used to determine species identity by comparison to known sequences. RESULTS: After chemotherapy, WHO scores of 0 and 1 were in 3 and 6 patients, respectively, and mean ANC (+/-SD) dropped from 3326 +/- 463 to 1091 +/- 1082 cells/mm(3). From pre- and post-chemotherapy samples, 41 species were detected, with a predominance of Gemella haemolysans and Streptococcus mitis. More than 85% of species have not been previously identified in chemotherapy patients. Seven species appeared exclusively before chemotherapy and 25 after chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, the number of species per patient increased by a mean of 2.6 (SD = 4.7, P = .052). CONCLUSION: We identified species not previously identified in chemotherapy patients. Our results suggest a shift to a more complex oral bacterial profile in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in aphthous ulcers.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent aphthous ulcers are common lesions of the oral mucosa of  which the etiology is unknown. This study aimed to estimate the bacterial diversity in the lesions and in control mucosa in pooled samples using a culture-independent molecular approach. METHODS: Samples were collected from ten healthy individuals and ten individuals with a clinical history of recurrent aphthous ulcers. After DNA extraction, the 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with universal primers; amplicons were cloned, sequenced and matched to the GenBank database. RESULTS: A total of 535 clones were analyzed, defining 95 bacterial species. We identified 62 putative novel phylotypes. In recurrent aphthous ulcer lesions 57 phylotypes were detected, of which 11 were known species. Control samples had 38 phylotypes, five of which were already known. Only three species or phylotypes were abundant and common to both groups (Gemella haemolysans, Streptococcus mitis strain 209 and Streptococcus pneumoniae R6). One genus was found only in recurrent aphthous ulcer samples (Prevotella) corresponding to 16% of all lesion-derived clones. CONCLUSION: The microbiota found in recurrent aphthous ulcers and in the control groups diverged markedly and the rich variety of genera found can provide a new starting point for individual qualitative and quantitative analyses of bacteria associated with this oral condition.
TI  - Horizontal transfer of the immunoglobulin A1 protease gene (iga) from Streptococcus to Gemella haemolysans.
AB  - Bacterial IgA1 proteases share the ability to cleave human IgA1 at the hinge region. Nature has developed this trait along at least five independent evolutionary lineages. To obtain further insight into the phylogeny and function of IgA1 proteases, the nucleotide sequence of the iga gene that encodes the IgA1 protease was determined from two Streptococcus mitis strains and one Gemella haemolysans strain. Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli confirmed that the genes encode human IgA1-cleaving activity. IgA1 proteases from Streptococcus and G. haemolysans shared structural features, including a motif typical for zinc-dependent metalloproteases of clan MA(E) family M26 and an N-terminal signal sequence followed by an LPXTG cell-wall-anchor motif and two putative membrane-spanning domains. In addition, they all harboured a repeat region preceding the active site of the protease. In the streptococcal IgA1 proteases, a G5 domain, which has been suggested to bind N-acetylglucosamine, was identified. Conservation of these structures in otherwise diverse proteases suggests that they are essential to the biological function of the enzyme. The phylogenetic distribution of homologous iga genes and conservation of gene order in the iga gene region in different Streptococcus species, combined with the sequence homologies, strongly suggest that the iga gene is more ancient in Streptococcus than in G. haemolysans, and therefore that the IgA1 protease gene was transferred from Streptococcus to G. haemolysans.
TI  - The growth of oral bacteria on saliva.
AB  - The present experiments were aimed at studying the degradation of salivary glycoproteins by the oral microflora. To this end, S. sanguis I strain Ny476 and S. sanguis II (S. mitior) strain Ny581 were grown continuously in human-whole saliva. Under these conditions, the strains produced a variety of cell-associated hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases, exo- and endopeptidases, and esterases. S. sanguis II generally exhibited higher levels of enzyme activity than did S. sanguis I, in particular of neuraminidase that was produced only by S. sanguis II. In accordance, S. sanguis II had a higher cell yield and consumed a higher proportion of the sugars and sialic acid in the glycoproteins than did S. sanguis I. Interestingly, S. sanguis I, which is devoid of neuraminidase, is known to have a lectin with specificity for sialic acid, whereas S. sanguis II has affinity for galactose residues in the glycoproteins. We propose that specific binding of glycoproteins by oral bacteria constitutes a mechanism to collect nutrients in the vicinity of the cell. The special ability of S. sanguis II to utilize saliva for growth was further exemplified by its selection in batch-wise enrichments of dental plaque on saliva. The microflora in these enrichment cultures always consisted of Peptostreptococcus micros, S. sanguis II, and Fusobacterium nucleatum as the dominant organisms. Further, S. mitis and Gemella haemolysans were generally found to be present. The enrichment cultures produced a wide variety of mainly cell-bound hydrolytic enzymes. This resulted in almost complete breakdown of salivary glycoproteins in the culture.
