TI  == reduction of the enniatins a, a(1), b, b(1) by an in vitro degradation employing  different strains of probiotic bacteria: identification of degradation products by lc-ms-lit.
AB  == the degradation of the fusarium mycotoxins ens by 9 bacterial strains characteristic of the gastrointestinal tract like bb. longum, bb. bifidum, bb. breve, bb. adolescentes, lb. rhamnosus, lb. casei-casei, s. termofilus, lb. ruminis, lb. casei and twenty two strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied. the fermentations were carried out in the liquid medium of de man rogosa sharpe (mrs) under anaerobic conditions for bifidobacteria streptococcus and lactobacillus, and in potato dextrose broth (pdb) for saccharomyces strains, during 48 h. the degradation of the bioactive compounds ens was also studied in a food system composed by wheat flour naturally contaminated by ens through fermentation by a strain of fusarium tricinctum. the determination of the ens in  the fermentation mediums was performed using the technique of the liquid chromatography coupled to the mass spectrometry detector in tandem (lc-ms/ms), whereas the identification of the degradation products produced by microbial fermentation was carried out using the technique of the lc coupled to the linear  ion trap (lit). all the bacteria analyzed in this study showed a significant ens  reduction in vitro during the fermentation processes, with degradation data ranging from 5 to the 99%. in the food system, the ens degradation data evidenced ranged from 1.3 to 49.2%. also three ens degradation products were identified.

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == variation of microbiological and biochemical parameters in the faeces of two healthy people over a 15 day period.
AB  == background: recent years have seen increasing interest in the complex microbial ecosystem of the human gastrointestinal tract. knowledge of its microbial colonists and their beneficial/detrimental activities is important. however, generalized assumptions about the microbial composition of the human gut should be taken with caution until more studies in different human communities have been conducted. the capacity of modulating or inhibiting harmful populations through high doses of beneficial microorganisms (probiotics) is now an attractive possibility. aims: the aim of this study was to determine the daily variation in  the most prominent and representative of the cultivable microbial populations in  the faeces of two healthy spanish persons, with special reference to the lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria). faecal enzymatic activities caused or modulated by gut microorganisms were also examined. methods: microbial  populations were enumerated in selective and differential media. lab species isolated from mrs agar plates were further identified by phenotypic and genetic techniques. enzymatic activities were measured by the semi quantitative method of the api zym system. results: obligate anaerobes (members of the clostridium clusters and species of bacteroides and bifidobacteria) made up the largest bacterial populations in both individuals (ranging between 10(10)-10(11) cfu/g of faeces) and remained constant over time. lactobacilli species were found at an intermediate level (around 10(8) cfu/g), and yeasts and moulds, staphylococci, enterococci, coliforms and enterobacteriaceae at a lower level (between 10(3) to  10(6) cfu/g). 38 lactic acid bacteria strains identified belonged to bifidobacterium bifidum [19], bifidobacterium longum [7], bifidobacterium adolescentis [7] and lactobacillus ruminis [5] species. enzymatic profiles and values were shown to be personal and stable, but inter-sample fluctuations were recorded. conclusions: the dominant microbial populations in the faeces of the two persons were similar and stable during the sampling period. large differences were found in the lactic acid bacterial composition of each individual. biochemistry seemed to be also personal and stable over time.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.
