TI  == sudan azo dyes and para red degradation by prevalent bacteria of the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == sudan azo dyes have genotoxic effects and ingestion of food products contaminated with sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red could lead to exposure in the human gastrointestinal tract. in this study, we examined thirty-five prevalent species  of human intestinal bacteria to evaluate their capacity to degrade sudan dyes and para red. among these tested bacterial strains, 23, 13, 33, 30, and 29 out of 35  species tested were able to reduce sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively, to some extent. bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and ruminococcus obeum were able  to reduce completely all four tested sudan dyes and para red. escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus magnus were the only two strains that were not able to reduce any of the tested sudan dyes and para red to any significant extent. metabolites of the reduction of the tested sudan dyes and para red by e. faecalis were isolated and identified by hplc and lc/esi-ms analyses and compared with authentic standards. thus it appears that the ability to reduce sudan dyes and para red except sudan ii is common among bacteria in the human colon.
