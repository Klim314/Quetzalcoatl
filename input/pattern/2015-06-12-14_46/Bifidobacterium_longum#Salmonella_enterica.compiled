TI  - Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria attenuate the proinflammatory response in intestinal epithelial cells induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - Inflammation is a physiological response to infections and tissue injury; however, abnormal immune responses can give rise to chronic inflammation and contribute to disease progression. Various dietary components, including probiotic lactic acid bacteria and prebiotics, have the potential to modulate intestinal inflammatory responses. One factor in particular, the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL-8), is one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. The purpose of this study was to investigate modulation of the inflammatory host response induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 in the presence of selected probiotics and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from human sources, dairy products, and farm animals. IL-8 gene expression and protein production in HT-29 cells were evaluated by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Pre-incubation of HT-29 cells with Lactobacillus kefir IM002, Bifidobacterium adolescentis FRP 61, Bifidobacterium longum FRP 68 and FRP 69, Bifidobacterium breve FRP 334, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides IM080 significantly inhibited IL-8 secretion induced by Salmonella Typhimurium DT104. Co-culture of selected probiotics and Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 reduced IL-8 production, while potential probiotics and LAB had no effect on IL-8 secretion in HT-29 cells preincubated with Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 prior to adding probiotics. Lactobacillus kefir IM002 supernatant also significantly reduced IL-8 production. In conclusion, our study suggests that probiotic bifidobacteria and LAB modulate cytokine induction and possess anti-inflammatory properties; however, the effectiveness is strain dependent.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLf), but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-bLf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield bLf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-bLf. However, whether bLf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. Therefore, various probiotic strains in Taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate in vitro. Thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and Bifidobacterium lactis BCRC 17394 were inhibited by both apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate. The growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, including L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 11739, Lactobacillus coryniformis ATCC 25602, L. acidophilus BCRC 14065, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8081. However, apo-bLf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the supernatants produced by L. fermentum, B. lactis, and B. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. Importantly, a combination of apo-bLf or bLf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. In conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-bLf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
TI  - Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 protects against salmonella-induced reductions in  digestive enzyme activity in mice by attenuation of the host inflammatory response.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Salmonella-induced damage to the small intestine may decrease the villi-associated enzyme activity, causing malabsorption of nutrients and diarrhea, and thus contribute to the symptoms of infection. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism by which different doses and durations of Salmonella infection and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affect brush border enzyme activity in the mouse, and to determine if the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis 35624 could attenuate the intestinal damage. METHODS: BALB/c mice were challenged with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium UK1 at various doses (10(2)-10(8) colony-forming unit (CFU)) and durations (10(6) CFU for 1-6 days). Mice were also treated with B. longum subsp. infantis 35624 for 2 weeks before and during a 6-day S. Typhimurium challenge (10(6) CFU), or before injection of LPS. The small intestine was assessed for morphological changes, mRNA expression of cytokines, and activity of the brush border enzymes sucrase-isomaltase, maltase, and alkaline phosphatase. RESULTS: S. Typhimurium infection significantly reduced the activity of all brush border enzymes in a dose- and time-dependent manner (P<0.05). This also occurred following injection of LPS. Pre-treatment with B. longum subsp. infantis 35624 prevented weight loss, protected brush border enzyme activity, reduced the small intestinal damage, and inhibited the increase in interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-8 expression due to Salmonella challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Salmonella infection reduces the small intestinal brush border enzyme activity in mice, with the level of reduction and associated weight loss increasing with dose and duration of infection. B. longum subsp. infantis 35624 treatment attenuated the effect of Salmonella infection on brush border enzyme activity and weight loss, which may be due to modulation of the host immune response.
TI  - Effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. Eight probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH, Lactobacillus brevis KACC 10553, Lactobacillus casei KACC 12413, Lactobacillus paracasei ATCC 25598, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Leuconostoc mesenteroides KACC 12312, and Pediococcus acidilactici KACC 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. The ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. L. acidophilus, L. brevis, and P. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. P. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mM to the detection limits, respectively. The antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. The study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.
TI  - Cell viability and immunostimulating and protective capacities of Bifidobacterium longum 51A are differentially affected by technological variables in fermented milks.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the cell viability of Bifidobacterium longum 5(1A) in fermented milks and to study its immunostimulating and protective capacity against Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica serovar Typhimurium infection in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bifidobacterium longum 5(1A) was added to milk fermented with different yoghurt starter cultures, before or after fermentation, and viability was monitored during storage (5 degrees C, 28 days). Resistance to simulated gastric acid digestion was assessed. Fermented milks were orally administered to mice for 10 days followed by oral infection with Salmonella Typhimurium. The number of IgA+ cells in the small and large intestine was determined before infection. Survival to infection was monitored for 20 days. Bifidobacterium longum 5(1A) lost viability during storage, but the product containing it was effective for the induction of IgA+ cells proliferation in the gut and for the protection of mice against Salm. Typhimurium infection. CONCLUSIONS: Cell viability of Bif. longum 5(1A) in fermented milks along storage did not condition the capacity of the strain to enhance the number of IgA+ cells in the gut and to protect mice against Salmonella infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The uncoupling of cell viability and functionality demonstrated that, in certain cases, nonviable cells can also exert positive effects.
TI  - Genetically modified Bifidobacterium displaying Salmonella-antigen protects mice  from lethal challenge of Salmonella Typhimurium in a murine typhoid fever model.
AB  - We developed a novel vaccine platform utilizing Bifidobacterium as an antigen delivery vehicle for mucosal immunization. Genetically modified Bifidobacterium longum displaying Salmonella-flagellin on the cell surface was constructed for the oral typhoid vaccine. The efficiency of this vaccine was evaluated in a murine model of typhoid fever. We then orally administered 2.5 x 10(7) CFU of the recombinant Bifidobacterium longum (vaccine) or parental Bifidobacterium longum, or PBS to BALB/C mice every other day for 2 weeks. After the administration, a total of 42 mice (14 mice in each group) were challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium (1.0 x 10(7) CFU/mouse). While 12 mice in the PBS group, and 9 in the parental Bifidobacterium longum group died (median survival: 14 and 25 days), only two in the vaccine group died. These data support that our genetically modified Bifidobacterium antigen delivery system offers a promising vaccine platform for inducing efficient mucosal immunity.
TI  - Enhancement of antimicrobial and antimutagenic activities of Korean barberry (Berberis koreana Palib.) by the combined process of high-pressure extraction with probiotic fermentation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the combined effects of high pressure extraction (HPE) and probiotic fermentation on the antimicrobial and antimutagenic activities, Berberis koreana was subjected to 500 MPa for 30 min and then fermented with Bifidobacterium longum B6 (HPE-BLF) and Lactobacillus paracasei (HPE-LPF) at 37 degrees C for 6 days. RESULTS: The phenol content was significantly increased to 228 mg GAE g(-1) by the HPE compared to the conventional extraction (CE, 188 mg GAE g(-1)). The HPE-BLF and HPE-LPF showed the highest antimicrobial activity (MIC < 4 mg mL(-1)) against beta-lactam antibiotic sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus. No significant mutagenic effect was observed for CE, HPE, HPE-BLF, and HPE-LPF extracts. The highest antimutagenic activities against frame-shift mutant Salmonella typhimurium were observed at the HPE-LPF (82%), followed by the HPE-BLF (77%). CONCLUSION: The combined HPE and fermentation process could be used as an alternative extraction method for improving the extraction efficacy of medicinal plants. The results will provide pharmaceutically useful information and potential direction for finding new drug sources from medicinal plants.
TI  - Dietary glycosaminoglycans interfere in bacterial adhesion and gliadin-induced pro-inflammatory response in intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells.
AB  - Dietary components may have an important role in maintaining a balanced gut microbiota composition. Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gliadins, and has been associated with a reduced proportion of Bifidobacterium in gut microbiota. This study evaluates the influence of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on bacterial adhesion and their contribution in the gliadins-induced inflammatory response. The adhesion of potential probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 and Bifidobacterium bifidum CECT 7365), commensal (Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis) and pathogenic (Salmonella enterica CECT 443 and Listeria monocytogenes CECT 935) bacteria to mucin and Caco-2 cell cultures was determined. Gliadins were subjected to in vitro digestion (pepsin/pancreatin-bile), with/out GAGs, and the presence or not of cell suspensions of B. longum (10(8) CFU/ml). B. longum, E. coli, and L. monocytogenes, markedly interact with the high-sulphur-containing fraction of GAGs. The GAGs reduced the gliadins-mediated production of interleukin-1beta, but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha. The results suggest that GAGs may ameliorate gliadin-induced inflammatory response, though they also slightly interfere with the action of B. longum.
TI  - Interaction of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains with human intestinal epithelial cells: adhesion properties, competition against enteropathogens and modulation of IL-8 production.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human nutrition and health by promoting the supply of nutrients, preventing pathogen colonization and shaping and maintaining normal mucosal immunity. The depletion of the individual microbiota can result in a higher susceptibility to enteropathogenic bacteria infection. In order to reduce this risk, the use of food supplements containing probiotic bacteria has been recently addressed. In this paper, we investigate the protective role toward enteropathogen infection of probiotic strains belonging to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. According to our experimental data, Lactobacillus acidophilus Bar13, L. plantarum Bar10, Bifidobacterium longum Bar33 and B. lactis Bar30 were effective in displacing the enteropathogens Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli H10407 from a Caco-2 cell layer. Moreover, L. acidophilus Bar13 and B. longum Bar33 have been assessed for their immunomodulatory activity on IL-8 production by HT29 cells. Both strains showed the potential to protect enterocytes from an acute inflammatory response. These probiotic strains are potential candidates for the development of new functional foods helpful in counteracting enteropathogen infections.
TI  - Exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  - Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. The genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of EPS-encoding genes. However, the physiological role that EPSs play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. In this study, we have assessed the effect of EPSs produced by Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium longum NB667, and Bifidobacterium animalis IPLA-R1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. The EPS fraction GG had no significant effect on the adhesion of L. rhamnosus GG and B. animalis IPLA-R1. However, the EPS fractions NB667 and IPLA-R1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. In contrast, the three EPS fractions increased the adhesion of Enterobacter sakazakii ATCC 29544 and Escherichia coli NCTC 8603. Higher adherence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 29631 and Clostridium difficile ATCC 9689 was detected in the presence of the EPS fractions GG and NB667. In general, these effects were obtained at EPS concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were EPS dose dependent. The competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of EPS could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus. The increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific EPSs and the bound EPSs are able to adhere to mucus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of EPSs from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.
TI  - Mutagenicity and antimutagenic effect of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - In this study, soymilk was first fermented with lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum) both individually and simultaneously. Mutagenicity and the suppression of fermented soymilk against the mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), a direct-acting mutagen, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (DMAB), an indirect-acting mutagen, on Salmonella typhimurium TA 100, was then investigated. It was found that the fermented soymilk shows no mutagenic activity on Sal. typhimurium TA 100. Fermentation, in general, significantly (p<0.05) enhanced the antimutagenicity of soymilk. The levels of increased antimutagenicity of fermented soymilk varied with the starter organism and the type of mutagen tested. Although unfermented soymilk exerted lower antimutagenic activity against DMAB than 4-NQO, the fermented soymilk, generally, showed a higher antimutagenic activity against DMAB than 4-NQO. Among the various fermented soymilk tested, soymilk fermented with both Str. themophilus and B. infantis simultaneously exhibited the highest antimutagenicity of 85.07% and 85.78%, respectively, against 4-NQO and DMAB Further investigation on this fermented soymilk revealed that both the antimutagenic factors formed during fermentation and the cells of the starter organisms contributed to the increased antimutagenic activity against DMAB, while the former led to the increased activity against 4-NQO.
TI  - Adhesion properties and competitive pathogen exclusion ability of bifidobacteria  with acquired acid resistance.
AB  - The adhesion properties of Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium catenulatum strains with an acquired resistance to acid and their ability to competitively exclude Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterobacter sakazakii, and Clostridium difficile from adhering to human intestinal mucus were evaluated and compared with the results when the same experiments were run with the original acid-sensitive strains. In half of the four studied cases, the acid-resistant derivative showed a greater ability to adhere to human intestinal mucus than the original strain. The ability of bifidobacteria to inhibit pathogen adhesion to mucus was not generally improved by the acquisition of acid resistance. In contrast, three of the four acid-resistant strains showed a greater ability to displace preadhered pathogens than the original strains, especially preadhered Salmonella Typhimurium and C. difficile. Overall, the induction of acid resistance in bifidobacteria could be a strategy when selecting strains with enhanced stability and improved surface properties that favor their potential functionality as probiotics against specific pathogens.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  - AIM: To develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, Bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). Bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. Pyelonephritic Escherichia coli was highly suppressed by GG and both bifidobacteria strains. Lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and ME-3 were the most effective against Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while ME-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against Shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against Helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. The highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for Lact. fermentum ME-3 (P < 0.05). No efficient antagonist against Clostridium difficile was found. The positive correlations between the pH, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Screening Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Effect of Bifidobacterium longum ingestion on experimental salmonellosis in mice.
AB  - AIMS: The effect of lactic acid bacteria on the immune system is well established under normal conditions and generally by in vivo determinations, but few data are available, in vivo, during an infectious challenge. The objective of this study was to obtain data on the putative protective role of bifidobacteria upon challenge with an intestinal pathogen. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of oral treatment with Bifidobacterium longum Bb46 on intragastric challenge with Salmonella Typhimurium was studied. Faecal bacterial levels were determined in gnotobiotic (GN) mice and mortality, histopathology (intestines, liver), immunoglobulin levels (IgM, IgG, IgG1, IgG2a) and cytokine production (IFN-gamma, IL-10) were determined in conventional (CV) mice. Conventional mice received 0.1 ml probiotic milk (10(8) CFU) daily, 10 days before the oral pathogenic challenge (10(2) CFU). Then, probiotic treatment was continued until the end of the experiment. Probiotic treatment in germ-free mice consisted of a single dose at the beginning of the experiment. Control groups were treated with sterile skim milk and submitted to the same procedure. A higher survival (40%) was observed for probiotic-treated animals when compared with the control group (0%). This protective effect was confirmed by the histopathological and morphometric data. However, S. Typhimurium population levels in the faeces were similar among control and probiotic-treated groups. During the challenge with S. Typhimurium, a decrease in IFN-gamma and IgG2a productions was observed in probiotic-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: The protective effect against the pathogenic challenge may be due to a reduced inflammatory response, mediated by the probiotic treatment, but not to a population antagonism. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results suggest that dietary supplementation with B. longum could provide benefits against enteric infection.
TI  - The antimutagenic properties of a polysaccharide produced by Bifidobacterium longum and its cultured milk against some heterocyclic amines.
AB  - The antimutagenicity and fermentation pattern of three Bifidobacterium longum strains (B. longum, B. longum PS+, and B. longum PS-) in skim milk were studied. The increase in fermentation time significantly increased antimutagenicity with all strains tested against the mutagenicity of both 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido-[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) in an Ames-like test using streptomycin-dependent strain SD510 of Salmonella typhimurium TA98. Bifidobacterium longum PS+, a polysaccharide-producing strain, had a longer lag phase but showed the highest inhibition percentage against both mutagens tested. The viability of B. longum PS+ cells was not affected by the low pH of 4.1, probably owing to the protection offered by the polysaccharide produced. The antimutagenicity of the fermented milk against Trp-P-1 was dose dependent. The strains were also able to bind with different amino acid pyrolysates, and B. longum showed the highest binding. Acetone extracts of fermented skim milk dissolved in water showed less antimutagenicity than extracts dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. The isolated crude polysaccharide from B. longum PS+ showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the mutagenicity of Trp-P-1. Thus, we conclude that the polysaccharide of B. longum PS+ can be used as an antimutagen.
TI  - Influence of carcinogen binding by lactic acid-producing bacteria on tissue distribution and in vivo mutagenicity of dietary carcinogens.
AB  - The aims of this investigation were to determine whether viable cultures of lactic acid-producing organisms (LAB) can bind dietary carcinogens and to assess the consequences of binding for the absorption from the gut, distribution in the body and in vivo genotoxicity of ingested carcinogens. The carcinogens used in this study were ones known to be present in the human diet, namely benzo[a]pyrene (B(a)P, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and the cooked food carcinogens 2-amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 5-phenyl-2-amino-1-methylimidazo [4,5-f]pyridine (PhIP) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2). They represent a range of structural types so that the specificity of any binding effects could be addressed. Of the carcinogens tested, B(a)P and Trp-P-2 were bound most effectively by the two LAB strains Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus. AFB1 was poorly bound, while MeIQx, MeIQ, PhIP and IQ were bound to an intermediate degree. The extent of the binding of the heterocyclic amine carcinogens was dependent on the pH conditions during incubation and this effect was more apparent with B. longum than with L. acidophilus. Using the host-mediated assay (HMA), an in vivo bacterial mutation assay, it was demonstrated that the administration of bacterial cell suspensions of B. longum and L. acidophilus did not lead to a reduction in induced mutagenicity by MeIQ, MeIQx or Trp-P-2, detectable in the liver of treated mice compared with controls. The lack of a protective effect could not be attributed to a short period of contact between bacterial cells and mutagens, since similar results were obtained after preincubating bacteria and mutagens together at pH 5 for 50-60 min, to maximize the binding, before gavaging the mice. Lack of activity of B(a)P in the HMA prevented the determination of the effect of LAB on genotoxicity of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. However, it is clear from the radiolabel distribution study that the amount of the carcinogen entering the blood was not significantly reduced by B. longum administration. In addition, the amount of radiolabelled B(a)P that reached the target organs (liver, lungs and heart) was also not affected by the LAB administration. A similar lack of inhibitory effect of B. longum on blood concentration and accumulation in the liver of Trp-P-2 was apparent. The results of the present study suggest that although LAB may bind carcinogens in vitro, this does not lead to major changes in absorption and distribution of carcinogens in the body, or in their genotoxic activity in the liver.
