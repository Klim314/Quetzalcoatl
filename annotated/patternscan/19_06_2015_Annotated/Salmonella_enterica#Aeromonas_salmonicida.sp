TI  == myxinidin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the epidermal mucus of hagfish, myxine glutinosa l.
AB  == fish epidermal mucus contains innate immune components that provide a first line  of defense against various infectious pathogens. this study reports the bioassay-guided fractionation and characterization of a novel antimicrobial peptide, myxinidin, from the acidic epidermal mucus extract of hagfish (myxine glutinosa l.). edman sequencing and mass spectrometry revealed that myxinidin consists of 12 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 1,327.68 da. myxinidin showed activity against a broad range of bacteria and yeast pathogens at minimum  bactericidal concentration (mbc) ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 microg/ml. screened pathogens, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium c610, escherichia coli d31, aeromonas salmonicida a449, yersinia ruckeri 96-4, and listonella anguillarum 02-11 were found to be highly sensitive to myxinidin at the mbc of 1.0-2.5 microg/ml; staphylococcus epidermis c621 and yeast (candida albicans c627) had an mbc of 10.0 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activity of myxinidin was found to be two to 16 times more active than a potent fish-derived antimicrobial peptide, pleurocidin (nrc-17), against most of the screened pathogens. the microbicidal activity of myxinidin was retained in the presence of sodium chloride (nacl) at concentrations up to 0.3 m and had no hemolytic activity against mammalian red blood cells. these results suggest that myxinidin may have potential applications in fish and human therapeutics.

TI  == transferable, multiple antibiotic and mercury resistance in atlantic canadian isolates of aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is associated with carriage  of an inca/c plasmid similar to the salmonella enterica plasmid psn254.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to examine the molecular basis for multiple antibiotic and mercury resistance in canadian isolates of aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. methods: phenotypic and genotypic methods were employed to identify plasmid-associated antibiotic and mercury resistance genes and to determine the organization of those genes in multidrug-resistant (mdr) a. salmonicida isolates. results: the mdr phenotype was transferable via conjugation using escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila and edwardseilla tarda as recipients. antibiotic and mercury resistance genes were carried by a conjugative inca/c plasmid. three distinct antibiotic resistance cassettes were characterized; first a class i integron containing an aada7 gene encoding for an  aminoglycoside-3'-adenyltransferase, the second cassette showed 99.9% nucleotide  sequence homology to a cassette previously identified in the salmonella enterica  inca/c plasmid psn254, containing flor, teta, sulii and stra/strb sequences. the  third cassette showed 100% nucleotide sequence similarity to a transposon-like element, containing a bla(cmy-2) beta-lactamase in association with suge and blc  sequences. this element is known to be widely distributed among clinical and food-borne salmonella and other enterobacteriaceae throughout asia and the united states. mercury resistance was linked to the presence of a mer operon that showed 100% nucleotide sequence homology to the mer operon carried by plasmid psn254. conclusions: each mdr a. salmonicida isolate carried the same plasmid, which was  related to plasmid psn254. this is the first report of plasmid-mediated florfenicol-resistant a. salmonicida in north america. in addition, it is the first report of a plasmid-associated ampc beta-lactamase sequence in a member of  the aeromonadaceae.

TI  == synergy of histone-derived peptides of coho salmon with lysozyme and flounder pleurocidin.
AB  == recent research has identified endogenous cationic antimicrobial peptides as important factors in the innate immunity of many organisms, including fish. it is known that antimicrobial activity, as well as lysozyme activity, can be induced in coho salmon (oncorhynchus kisutch) mucus after exposure of the fish to infectious agents. since lysozyme alone does not have antimicrobial activity against vibrio anguillarum and aeromonas salmonicida, a four-step protein purification protocol was used to isolate and identify antibacterial fractions from bacterially challenged coho salmon mucus and blood. the purification consisted of extraction with hot acetic acid, extraction and concentration on a c(18) cartridge, gel filtration, and reverse-phase chromatography on a c(18) column. n-terminal amino acid sequence analyses revealed that both the blood and  the mucus antimicrobial fractions demonstrated identity with the n terminus of trout h1 histone. mass spectroscopic analysis indicated the presence of the entire histone, as well as fragments thereof, including a 26-amino-acid n-terminal segment. these fractions inhibited the growth of antibiotic-supersuscptible salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, as well as a. salmonicida and v. anguillarum. synthetic peptides identical to the n-terminally  acetylated or c-terminally amidated 26-amino-acid fragment were inactive in antimicrobial assays, but they potentiated the antimicrobial activities of the flounder peptide pleurocidin, lysozyme, and crude lysozyme-containing extracts from coho salmon. the peptides bound specifically to anionic lipid monolayers. however, synergy with pleurocidin did not appear to occur at the cell membrane level. the synergistic activities of inducible histone peptides indicate that they play an important role in the first line of salmon defenses against infectious pathogens and that while some histone fragments may have direct antimicrobial effects, others improve existing defenses.

TI  == production by aeromonas of common enterobacterial antigen and its possible taxonomic significance.
AB  == in a study of production of the common enterobacterial antigen (ca) by members of the aeromonas group, ten strains of a. shigelloides, nine strains of a. hydrophila, and nine strains of a. salmonicida were used. passive hemagglutination and hemolysis tests as well as the hemagglutination-inhibition procedure revealed that all strains of a. shigelloides, in contrast to the strains of the other two species, produce this antigenic determinant. the antigen of a. shigelloides was demonstrated even when the supernatant fluids of agar-grown cultures were used in a dilution of 1:1,000, whereas 10-times concentrated supernatant fluids obtained from the other two species were negative. supernatant liquids of cultures of a. shigelloides failed to induce a significant ca immune response in rabbits; nonetheless, the animals were primed immunologically and responded with prompt production of ca antibodies in significant titers to a booster injection of a subeffective dose of ca obtained from salmonella typhimurium. strains of a. hydrophila and a. salmonicida neither  induced ca antibody formation nor primed the animals. it is concluded that of the three species of the aeromonas group only a. shigelloides, which may produce o antigen cross-reacting with shigella sonnei and which has been isolated from patients with dysentery or gastroenteritis, produces ca. production of this antigen, therefore, may help to characterize microorganisms belonging or related  to the family enterobacteriaceae.
