TI  - The geomicrobiology of gold.
AB  - Microorganisms capable of actively solubilizing and precipitating gold appear to  play a larger role in the biogeochemical cycling of gold than previously believed. Recent research suggests that bacteria and archaea are involved in every step of the biogeochemical cycle of gold, from the formation of primary mineralization in hydrothermal and deep subsurface systems to its solubilization, dispersion and re-concentration as secondary gold under surface conditions. Enzymatically catalysed precipitation of gold has been observed in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea (for example, Thermotoga maritime, Pyrobaculum islandicum), and their activity led to the formation of gold- and silver-bearing sinters in New Zealand's hot spring systems. Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB), for example, Desulfovibrio sp., may be involved in the formation of gold-bearing sulphide minerals in deep subsurface environments; over geological timescales this may contribute to the formation of economic deposits. Iron- and sulphur-oxidizing bacteria (for example, Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans, A. thiooxidans) are known to breakdown gold-hosting sulphide minerals in zones of primary mineralization, and release associated gold in the process. These and other bacteria (for example, actinobacteria) produce thiosulphate, which is known to oxidize gold and form stable, transportable complexes. Other microbial processes, for example, excretion of amino acids and cyanide, may control gold solubilization in auriferous top- and rhizosphere soils. A number of bacteria and archaea are capable of actively catalysing the precipitation of toxic gold(I/III) complexes. Reductive precipitation of these complexes may improve survival rates of bacterial populations that are capable of (1) detoxifying the immediate cell environment by detecting, excreting and reducing gold complexes, possibly using P-type ATPase efflux pumps as well as membrane vesicles (for example, Salmonella enterica, Cupriavidus (Ralstonia) metallidurans, Plectonema boryanum); (2) gaining metabolic energy by utilizing gold-complexing ligands (for example, thiosulphate by A. ferrooxidans) or (3) using gold as metal centre in enzymes (Micrococcus luteus). C. metallidurans containing biofilms were detected on gold grains from two Australian sites, indicating that gold bioaccumulation may lead to gold biomineralization by forming secondary 'bacterioform' gold. Formation of secondary octahedral gold crystals from gold(III) chloride solution, was promoted by a cyanobacterium (P. boryanum) via an amorphous gold(I) sulphide intermediate. 'Bacterioform' gold and secondary gold crystals are common in quartz pebble conglomerates (QPC), where they are often associated with bituminous organic matter possibly derived from cyanobacteria. This may suggest that cyanobacteria have played a role in the formation of the Witwatersrand QPC, the world's largest gold deposit.
TI  - [Isolation and reassociation of acetogen and methanogen in a syntrophobic coculture degrading butyrate anaerobically].
AB  - Anaerobic coculture BF2 which degraded butyrate into acetate and produced methane was isolated from granular methanogenic sludge. The coculture is associated syntrophically the Syntrophomonas subsp. saponavida strain CF2 with Methanobacterium formicicum strain MF2 and appeared to degraded C4 approximately C18 fatty acids including isobutyrate. The optimal temperature and pH for growth was 37 degrees C and 7.7 respectively. The strain CF2 was obtained in pure culture with crotonate as substrate and produces acetate and butyrate. The doubling time of strain CF2 in crotonate media was about 20 hours. Strain CF2 is Gram negative, slightly curved 0.2 approximately 0.3 x 2.0 approximately 3.0 micron with round ends, motile by lateral flagellation at the concave side, non sporeforming. With a hydrogen scavenging organism, such as Methanospillum hungatei JF1, Methanobacterium formicicum 1535, Methanobrevibacterium bryantii 1125 and Desulfovibrio sp. B11, the strain CF2 paired up and the defined coculture degraded butyrate to acetate. When the strain CF2 associated with the original accompanist, Methanobacterium formicius strain MF2, the reassociated couculture degraded butyrate to acetate and produced methane again.
