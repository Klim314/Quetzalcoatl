TI  == emergence of unusual nonfermenting gram-negative nosocomial pathogens in a saudi  hospital.
AB  == this study aimed to determine the frequency of isolation and prevalence of drug resistance in nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (nfgnb) other than pseudomonas  aeruginosa and predisposing factors for the acquisition of nosocomial infections  caused by these emerging pathogens in a saudi tertiary care hospital. a total of  125 nonduplicating nfgnb nosocomial strains were isolated, of these, 68 (54.4%) were acinetobacter baumannii, 26 (20.8%) stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 14 (11.2%) alcaligenes faecalis, 12 (9.6%) chryseobacterium indologenes, and 5 (4%) ralstonia pickettii. mics of 11 antibiotics were determined using the reference broth microdilution method. with the exception of colistin that inhibited 100% of a. baumannii isolates, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole that inhibited 100% of s. maltophilia isolates, and carbapenems that inhibited 100% of a. faecalis isolates, none of the tested antimicrobial agents inhibited 100% of the other nfgnb spp. our results emphasize that clinicians and microbiologists should consider a. faecalis, c. indologenes, and r. pickettii as emerging nosocomial pathogens. in addition, local resistance data are essential for helping physicians in deciding an appropriate antibiotic for empirical therapy of infections with these emerging and unusual nfgnb.

TI  == evaluation of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase for the identification of nonfermenting gram-negative rods.
AB  == to evaluate the activity of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (pyr) for the differentiation and identification of nonfermenting gram negative rods (nfgnr), 293 isolates were tested. a 24 h culture of each test organism was prepared. from this a 108-109 cfu/ml suspension was added to 0.25 ml of sterile physiologic solution. a pyr disk was then added and the test was incubated for 30 minutes at  35-37 degrees c, at environmental atmosphere. reading was done by adding 1 drop of cinnamaldehyde reagent. strains of acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter haemolyticus, alcaligenes faecalis, bergeyella zoohelcum, bordetella bronchiseptica, bordetella hinzii, brevundimonas diminuta, brevundimonas vesicularis, brucella ovis, brucella spp., brucella suis, burkholderia cepacia complex, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella lacunata, moraxella nonliquefaciens, moraxella osloensis, oligella ureolytica, pseudomonas alcaligenes, pseudomonas mendocina, pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas vb3, psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were pyr negative. on the other hand achromobacter piechaudii, achromobacter denitrificans, achromobacter xylosoxidans, burkholderia gladioli, chryseobacterium gleum-indologenes, comamonas testosroni, cupriavidus pauculus, delftia acidovorans, elizabethkingia meningoseptica, myroides spp., ochrobactrum  anthropi, pseudomonas oryzihabitans, ralstonia pickettii, rhizobium radiobacter,  shewanella spp., sphingobacterium multivorum, sphingobacterium spiritivorum, and  weeksella virosa were pyr positive. finally, acinetobacter lwoffii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, roseomonas spp., and sphingomonas paucimobilis-parapaucimobilis were pyr variable. pyr testing should be considered as a useful tool to facilitate the identification of nfgnr.
