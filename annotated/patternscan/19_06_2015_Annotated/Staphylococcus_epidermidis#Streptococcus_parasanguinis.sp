TI  == influence of the magnetic field on microorganisms in the oral cavity.
AB  == since the beginning of their lives, all living organisms are exposed to the influence of geomagnetic fields. objectives: with respect to the positive effects that magnetic fields have on human tissues, especially the bactericidal effect, this investigation aimed to assess their influence on the reduction of oral microorganisms. material and methods: in order to obtain adequate specimens of dental plaque deposit, microbes such as streptococcus parasanguinis, staphylococcus epidermidis, rhodococcus equi and candida albicans were isolated from the human mouth. to establish the intensity of microbial growth on the basis of the modified optical density (od) of agar turbidimetry assay, microbial count  and spectrophotometry were applied. the study was carried out with two microbial  concentrations (1 and 10 cfu/ml) after periods of incubation of 24 and 48 h and using micromagnets. results: a positive effect of the magnetic field, resulting in the reduction of dental plaque microbes in vitro, was found. in the first 24 hours of exposure to the magnetic field, the number of all isolated microbes was  significantly reduced. the most potent influence of magnets and the most intensified reduction after 24 hours were evident in candida albicans colonies. the decrease in the influence of magnets on microbes in vitro was also detected.  conclusions: magnets reduce the number of microbes and might be recommended as a  supplement in therapy for reduced periodontal tissues. this is important because  periodontal tissues that are in good conditions provide prolonged support to the  oral tissues under partial and supradental denture.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
