TI  == bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in china: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of chinese county hospitals. a total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from august 2010 to august 2011. drug sensitivity  testing was conducted in a central laboratory. a total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of escherichia coli, 606 klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 staphylococcus aureus, 308 streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 haemophilus influenzae. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in e. coli (42.3% strains), k. pneumoniae (31.7%), and proteus mirabilis (39.0%). ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of e. coli strains. salmonella spp. and shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. less than 8.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. for s. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of s. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of h. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. azithromycin-resistant h. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive m. catarrhalis were recorded. in conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant  strains of e. coli and klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. the antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly,  with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.

TI  == proteus mirabilis and its role in dacryocystitis.
AB  == purpose: dacryocystitis is a common inflammation of the lacrimal sac, usually from an underlying bacterial infection. most cases can be attributed to common ocular flora such as staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pneumoniae; however,  uncommon bacterial causes such as proteus mirabilis can still occur. p. mirabilis is a gram-negative bacillus that is found abundantly in people who have undergone long-term catheterization and is uncommonly found in or around the eyes except in people who have undergone long-term catheterization. proteus species can cause conjunctivitis, canaliculitis, and dacryocystitis and have the ability to manifest into preseptal cellulitis; therefore, timely recognition and treatment are important to prevent potential further complications. case report: an 84-year-old white man had several recurrences of acute dacryocystitis that had marginal improvement with empiric antibiotic treatment. resultant culture of the  ocular discharge revealed an uncommon bacterium, p. mirabilis. successful dosing  of oral antibiotics resolved the infection but ultimately the patient required an external dacryocystorhinostomy (dcr) procedure to maintain patency of the nasolacrimal lacrimal system and prevent recurrence. at 3 months after external dcr, the patient was symptom free with no recurrences. conclusions: dacryocystitis has a distinctive clinical presentation and is usually easily treated when appropriate oral antibiotics are directed at the underlying pathogen. in nonresponsive cases, culturing of the ocular discharge should be performed to identify the underlying pathogen. cases of dacryocystitis caused by  proteus species are usually responsive to several standard antibiotics used orally in eye care; however, culturing and susceptibility testing can streamline  the diagnostic and management sequence considerably in unclear or unresponsive cases. typically, patients with dacryocystitis return to normal after appropriate treatment, but chronic recurrences and epiphora are potential sequelae. patients  should be educated that a dcr surgical procedure may be needed to prevent future  recurrences in some cases.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

TI  == antibacterial activities and in vitro anti-inflammatory (membrane stability) properties of methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves.
AB  == this work is carried out with gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. the leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. methanol extract from the leaves of gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. the lower concentrations of methanolic leaf extract of gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with kanamycin. the crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of aspirin as positive control. the methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms like streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, and proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. the extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria.
AB  == background: pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. the disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. pid is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. this situation is not in any way different here in nigeria and more so in the federal capital territory, abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on pid. it therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. materials and methods: endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. results: out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. organisms encountered were  staphylococcus aureus (16%), escherichia coli (10%), streptococcus faecalis (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), streptococcus pyogenes (3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), proteus rettgeri (2%) and proteus mirabilis (1%). the highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). the age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). there was a significant difference in the acquisition of pid in relation to marital status (p < 0.05). however there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (p > 0.05). antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of pid due to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. conclusion: in conclusion, pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. pid is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. there is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. pid hence can be said to be a very serious  complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. the right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation.  treatment of pid should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with pid, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles green-synthesized  using pineapple leaf (ananas comosus).
AB  == pineapple leaf was used in this study for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles based on the search for sustainable synthetic means. indeed, this offered an economical and sustainable synthetic route relative to expensive and toxic chemical methods. the leaf extract was used and the corresponding nanoparticles obtained were subjected to uv-vis analysis at different times. the uv-vis was used to monitor the silver nanoparticle formation through sampling at time intervals. the formation of silver nanoparticles was apparently displayed within  2 min with evidence of surface plasmon bands (spb) between 440 and 460 nm. the crystals was equally characterized using ftir, x-ray diffraction methods and tem. the different results obtained suggested the appearance of silver nanoparticles (snps) as determined by the process parameters with a particle size of 12.4 nm. the sample was further screened against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli using gentamicin as control. from the results, there is evidence of inhibition towards bacteria growth. it can now be inferred from the studies that biosynthesis of nanoparticles could be a gateway to our numerous health issues.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == in-vitro, anti-bacterial activities of aqueous extracts of acacia catechu (l.f.)willd, castanea sativa, ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo against gram positive and gram negative bacteria.
AB  == objective: evaluations of the in-vitro anti-bacterial activities of aqueous extracts of acacia catechu (l.f.)willd, castanea sativa, ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumonia) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa) are reasonable since these ethnomedicinal plants have been used in persian folk medicine for treating skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders for ages. methods: the well diffusion method (kb testing) with a concentration of 250 mug/disc was used for evaluating the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic). maximum synergistic effects of different combinations of components were also observed. results: a particular combination of acacia catechu (l.f.) willd, castanea sativa, ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo extracts possesses an  outstanding anti-bacterial activity. it's inhibiting effect on microorganisms is  significant when compared to the control group (p< 0.05). staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive microorganism. the highest antibacterial activity against  gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumonia) or gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was exerted by formula number 2 (table1). conclusion: the results reveal the presence of antibacterial activities of acacia catechu, castanea sativa husk, ephedra sp. and mumiyo against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. synergistic effects in a combined formula, especially in  formula number 2 (aslan()) can lead to potential sources of new antiseptic agents for treatment of acute or chronic skin ulcers. these results considering the significant antibacterial effect of the present formulation, support ethno-pharmacological uses against diarrheal and venereal diseases and demonstrate use of these plants to treat infectious diseases.

TI  == plant-based hydrocarbon esters from tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw), aeromonas hydrophila, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus and proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against k. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. pseudomallei, alcaligens viscolactis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane  and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. for example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (mic of 7.8 microg/ml) against a. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (mic of 15.6 microg/ml) against p. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (mic of 31.25 microg/ml) on b. pseudomallei. cytotoxic effects of compounds were  assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an xtt assay. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. the 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. in conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane  isolated from t. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of prulifloxacin in comparison with other fluoroquinolones against community-acquired urinary and respiratory pathogens isolated in greece.
AB  == prulifloxacin, the prodrug of ulifloxacin, is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone rather recently introduced in certain european countries. we compared the antimicrobial potency of ulifloxacin with that of other fluoroquinolones against  common urinary and respiratory bacterial pathogens. the microbial isolates were prospectively collected between january 2007 and may 2008 from patients with community-acquired infections in greece. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin (for respiratory isolates only), and ulifloxacin using the e-test method. the binary logarithms of the mics [log2(mics)] were compared by using the wilcoxon signed-ranks test. a total of 409 isolates were studied. ulifloxacin had the lowest geometric mean mic for the 161 escherichia coli, 59 proteus mirabilis, and 22 staphylococcus saprophyticus urinary isolates, the second lowest geometric mean mic for the 38 streptococcus pyogenes respiratory isolates (after moxifloxacin), and the third lowest geometric mean mic for the 114 haemophilus influenzae and the 15 moraxella catarrhalis respiratory isolates (after ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin). compared with levofloxacin, ulifloxacin had lower log2(mics) against e. coli (p < 0.001),  p. mirabilis (p < 0.001), s. saprophyticus (p < 0.001), and s. pyogenes (p < 0.001). compared with ciprofloxacin, ulifloxacin had lower log2(mics) against p.  mirabilis (p < 0.001), s. saprophyticus (p = 0.008), and s. pyogenes (p < 0.001), but higher log2(mics) against h. influenzae (p < 0.001) and m. catarrhalis (p = 0.001). in comparison with other clinically relevant fluoroquinolones, ulifloxacin had the most potent antimicrobial activity against the community-acquired urinary isolates studied and very good activity against the respiratory isolates.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == hydramacin-1 in action: scrutinizing the barnacle model.
AB  == hydramacin-1 (hm1) from the metazoan hydra exerts antimicrobial activity against  a wide range of bacterial strains. notably, hm1 induces the aggregation of bacterial cells, accompanied by precipitation. to date, the proposed mechanism of peptide-lipid interaction, termed the barnacle model, has not been described on the molecular level. here, we show by biochemical and biophysical techniques that the lipid-peptide interactions of hm1 are initiated by electrostatic and hydrophobic effects, in particular, by tryptophan and neighboring polar amino acid residues that cause an interfacial localization of the peptide between two self-contained lipid bilayers. the high binding constants of hm1 upon lipid interaction are in the range of other potent antimicrobial peptides, e.g., magainin, and can be reasonably explained by two distinct epitopes on the surface of the peptide's global structure, which both contain swt(k/r) motifs. the residues of this motif favor localization of the peptide in the head group region of phospholipid bilayers up to a penetration depth of 4 a and a minor participation of the lipids' hydrocarbon regions. our results expand the knowledge about the molecular modes of action antimicrobial peptides use to tackle their target cells. furthermore, the aggregation of living bacteria by hm1 was observed for a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. therefore, the detailed view of peptide-lipid interactions described by the barnacle model consolidates it among the established models.

TI  == serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of ssis.
AB  == background: despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (ssis) is still high. an improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. the aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness  of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. methods: a total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several  surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. results: after single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and non-esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae. moreover, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans  were also inhibited. we found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring:  at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional ssis. conclusions: these preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.

AB  == the syntheses and single crystal x-ray structures of [ag(5-nitroquinoline)2]no3 (1), [ag(8-nitroquinoline)2]no3.h2o (2), [ag(6-methoxy-8-nitroquinoline)(no3)]n (3), [ag(3-quinolinecarbonitrile)(no3)]n (4), [ag(3-quinolinecarbonitrile)2]no3 (5), and [ag(6-quinolinecarboxylic acid)2]no3 (6) are described. as an alternative to solution chemistry, solid-state grinding could be used to prepare  compounds 1 and 3, but the preparation of 4 and 5 in this way failed. the ag(i) ions in the monomeric compounds 1, 2, 5, and 6 are coordinated to two ligands via the nitrogen atoms of the quinoline rings, thereby forming a distorted linear coordination geometry with ag-n bond distances of 2.142(2)-2.336(2) a and n-ag-n  bond angles of 163.62(13) degrees -172.25(13) degrees . the 1d coordination polymers 3 and 4 contain ag(i) centers coordinating one ligand and two bridging nitrate groups, thereby forming a distorted trigonal planar coordination geometry with ag-n bond distances of 2.2700(14) and 2.224(5) a, ag-o bond distances of 2.261(4)-2.536(5) a, and n-ag-o bond angles of 115.23(5) degrees -155.56(5) degrees . hirshfeld surface analyses of compounds 1-6 are presented as d(norm) and curvedness maps. the d(norm) maps show different interaction sites around the ag(i) ions, i.e., ag...ag interactions and possible o-h...o, c-h...o, c-h...n, and c-h...c hydrogen bonds. curvedness maps are a good way of visualizing pi-pi stacking interactions between molecules. the antimicrobial activities of compounds 1, 2, and 6 were screened against 15 different multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria isolated from diabetic foot ulcers and compared to the antimicrobial activities of the clinically used silver sulfadiazine (ss). compound 2 showed activity similar to ss against this set of test organisms, being active against all strains and having slightly better average silver efficiency than ss (5 vs 6 mug ag/ml). against the standard nonresistant bacterial strains of staphylococcus aureus , pseudomonas aeruginosa , proteus mirabilis , and streptococcus pyogenes , compound 1 performed better than silver  nitrate, with an average mic of 6 mug ag/ml versus 18 mug ag/ml for the reference agno3. electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms) analyses of compounds 3 and 6 in dmso/meoh confirm the two-coordinated ag(+) complexes in solution, and the results of the (1)h nmr titrations of dmso solutions of 5-nitroquinoline and  8-nitroquinoline with agno3 in dmso suggest that 5-nitroquinoline is more strongly coordinated to the silver ion.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

AB  == this study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. we enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). in symptomatic girls,  the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly proteus mirabilis (14.4%), enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and escherichia coli (7.0%). the finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with  vulvovaginitis symptoms. conclusion: the microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. the diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.

AB  == a 77-year-old woman presented with a trauma to the scalp caused from the blade of a windmill. the condition was persistent from the past 50 years. at the initial examination, a deep, foul-smelling and well-circumscribed ulcer was apparent on the head region, involving the majority of the cranium. skin biopsy specimens of  the lesion were nonspecific. the bone biopsy showed extensive necrotic areas of bone and soft tissues, with lymphocytic exudate foci. a computed tomography scan  of the head revealed bone destruction principally involving both the parietal bones, and parts of the frontal and occipital bones. streptococcus parasanguis was isolated from the skin culture, and proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus  sp. were identified in the cultures from the bone. a long-term treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (1 g/12 h) and levofloxacin (500 mg/day) was prescribed, but even after 6 months, the lesion remained unchanged. the frequency of occurrence of scalp ulcers in dermatological patients is less, principally because of the rich blood supply to this area. we have not found any similar case report of a scalp ulcer secondary to chronic osteomyelitis discovered more than 50 years after the causal trauma. we want to highlight the importance of complete cutaneous evaluation including skin and bone biopsies, when scalp osteomyelitis is suspected.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == [epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases of iasi, romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  == infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. the aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. material and methods: a retrospective study was conducted between january 2008 and december 2010 at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. results: from 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). there were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated,  being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative staphylococci (14/18,66%), enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group b streptococcus (3/4%), streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), aerococcus viridans, streptococcus equi, klebsiella pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, sphyngomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of s. aureus. among 16 invazive strains of e. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. there were no e.  coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. the mean mortality rate was 14,66%. conclusions: the high level of resistance of s. aureus and e. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.

AB  == jatropha curcas seeds contain 30-35% oil, which can be converted to high quality  biodiesel. however, jatropha oil is toxic, ascribed to the presence of phorbol esters (pes). in this study, isolated phorbol ester rich fraction (peef) was used to evaluate the activity of pes using three aquatic species based bioassays (snail (physa fontinalis), brine shrimp (artemeia salina), daphnia (daphnia magna)) and microorganisms. in all the bioassays tested, increase in concentration of pes increased mortality with an ec(50) (48 h) of 0.33, 26.48 and 0.95 mg l(-1) pes for snail, artemia and daphnia, respectively. the sensitivity of various microorganisms for pes was also tested. among the bacterial species tested, streptococcus pyogenes and proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 215 mg l(-1) pes; and pseudomonas putida were also sensitive with mic of 251 mg l(-1) pes. similarly, fusarium species of fungi exhibited ec(50) of 58 mg l(-1) pes, while aspergillus niger and curvularia lunata had ec(50) of 70 mg l(-1). the snail bioassay was most sensitive with 100% snail mortality at 1 mug of pes ml(-1). in conclusion, snail  bioassay could be used to monitor pes in jatropha derived products such as oil, biodiesel, fatty acid distillate, kernel meal, cake, glycerol or for contamination in soil or other environmental matrices. in addition, pes with molluscicidal/antimicrobial activities could be utilized for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications.

TI  == identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in lebanese patients.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. we conducted a study of 32 lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. the presence or absence of s aureus enterotoxin a, b, c, and d (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. a total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. of these, only 3 (8.8%) were s aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin b). moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. our results could not confirm that s aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the lebanese group studied.

TI  == autoimmune diseases: solution of the environmental, immunological and genetic components with principles for immunotherapy and transplantation.
AB  == autoimmune diseases have environmental and genetic components. these are the microbial trigger, the immunity system component and the genetic component. here  we describe these components and how they interact. known microbial triggers are  streptococcus pyogenes for rheumatic carditis, proteus mirabilis for rheumatoid arthritis and klebsiella pneumoniae for ankylosing spondylitis. the immunity system component has been clarified by realisation that no autoimmune disease is  caused by loss of suppressor t cells. this leaves burnet's forbidden clones, clearly seen in graves' disease, as the immunological defect. with wide scope for clonal diversification by somatic gene mutations, to prevent frequent autoimmunity the immunity system is policed by the histocompatibility system. this dictates the immune response repertoire by deleting complementary clones (h  gene theory). we show molecular evidence of how specific histocompatibility antigens can predispose to an autoimmune disease by influencing choice of the microbial antigen to which the immunity system reacts. because of the unlucky random element in the somatic mutations involved in their development, forbidden  clones are unlikely to reappear in new immune repertoires developing after immune ablation and autologous bone marrow cell reconstitution, as observed clinically.  isolation of autoantigens and their attachment to cytotoxic moieties could provide specific immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases. kaplans's discovery that  xenografts can be accepted without rejection after immune ablation followed by autologous and xenogeneic bone marrow inoculation, could enable widespread use of pig grafts for humans.

TI  == microbial aetiologic agents associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  == pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patients. the aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to hiv and mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. the patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. the tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of hiv/aids and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only hiv infection were 10 (5.9%). the  distribution of isolates were as follows, staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), candida albicans 24 (14.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. this study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to hiv/aids and tb or co-infection with tb/hiv-aids. this may lead to drug resistance, dots or haart programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine and tris-edta.
AB  == minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine 0.15% and tris-edta (otodine) were determined by broth microdilution for 150 isolates representing the most common pathogens associated  with canine otitis. the microorganisms were classified into three groups according to their levels of susceptibility. the most susceptible group included  staphylococcus pseudintermedius, malassezia pachydermatis, streptococcus canis and corynebacterium auriscanis, which were generally killed by 1 : 64 dilution of the antiseptic product (mbc = 23/0.8 microg/ml of chlorhexidine/tris-edta). the most resistant organism was proteus mirabilis, which survived up to 1 : 8 dilution of the product (mbc = 375/12 microg/ml). escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus displayed intermediate mbcs ranging between  188/6 and 47/1.5 microg/ml. interestingly, s. pseudintermedius was more susceptible than s. aureus, and no significant difference was observed between meticillin-resistant and meticillin-susceptible isolates within each species, indicating that antiseptic use is unlikely to co-select for meticillin resistance. although the concentrations required for killing (mbcs) varied considerably with microorganism type, the combination of chlorhexidine 0.15% and  tris-edta was active against all the pathogens most commonly involved in canine otitis.

TI  == microbiological findings in prepubertal girls with vulvovaginitis.
AB  == the aim of the study was to define the most common causes, symptoms and clinical  features of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls, and to evaluate treatment success depending on the causative agent involved. the study included 115 girls aged 2-8 (mean 4.8) years, presenting with vulvovaginitis to the outpatient clinic for pediatric and adolescent gynecology, zagreb children's hospital, between september 2006 and july 2007. medical history data were obtained from parents. vaginal samples were collected for microbiological culture by using cotton-tipped swabs moistened with saline. all samples were referred to microbiology laboratory, where standard microbiological diagnostic procedures were performed. selective and non-selective media were used. of 115 study patients, 43 (37.4%) had received antibiotic therapy more than one month prior to their visit to the clinic, mainly for upper respiratory tract infection. the most common presenting symptom was increased vaginal discharge usually noticed on the  pants or diaper, found in 26 of 115 (22.6%) patients, followed by vulvar redness  in 16 (13.9%), burning in seven (6.1%), itching in the vulvovaginal area in seven (6.1%), soreness in six (5.2%), odor in three (2.6%) patients, and two or more of these symptoms in another 50 (43.5%) patients. fifty-nine of 115 children had normal clinical finding on gynecologic examination. among the remaining 56 children, the most common finding was erythema observed in 19, vaginal discharge  in ten, and a combination of discharge and erythema in 13 patients. of 115 study  patients, causative agents were isolated from vaginal culture in 38 (33%) cases.  of these, 21 grew group a beta hemolytic streptococcus, five patients haemophilus influenzae, three escherichia coli, two enterococcus spp., and one each staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. antibiotic therapy was administered in 31 of these 38 patients, except for those  cases where intestinal bacteria and staphylococcus aureus were isolated and topical therapy and hygienic measures were applied alone. accordingly, vulvovaginitis in girls was most commonly caused by pathogens originating from the patient upper respiratory tract, accompanied by the symptoms of redness and vaginal discharge. in these cases, antibiotic treatment was administered. in the  majority of prepubertal girls with either vulvitis or normal genital finding, simple measures to improve hygiene will lead to resolution of all symptoms.

TI  == invasive bacteria isolates from children with severe infections in a nigerian hospital.
AB  == background: little information is available about the aetiology and epidemiology  of serious bacterial infections in nigeria. this study determined bacterial isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) of children presenting in the emergency room of a teaching hospital in nigeria. method: from october 2005 to december 2006, children aged two to 60 months presenting with signs of acute systemic infections were recruited. blood culture and csf specimens were collected and processed using standard microbiological protocols. data were analysed using spss version 11 software. results: two hundred and two blood and 69 csf samples were cultured. fifty-five (27%) of the blood cultures yielded gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci in almost equal proportions. the most common isolates from the blood cultures were staphylococcus aureus, 26 (12.9%) and atypical coliforms, 13 (6.5%). others are klebsiella spp, 3 (1.5%); klebsiella pneumonia, 2 (1.0%); escherichia coli, 3 (1.5%); enterobacter agglomerans, 2 (1.1%); proteus mirabilis, 2(1%); pseudomonas spp, 2 (1.0%); haemophilus influenza, 1 (1.0%); and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, 1 (1.0%). fourteen out of 67 (20.9%) of the csf samples yielded bacterial isolates: streptococcus pneumonia, 3 (4.5%); haemophilus influenza, 8 (11.9%); hemophilus spp, 1 (1.5%); e. coli, 1 (1.5%); and atypical coliform, 1 (1.5%). gram-negative  coliform isolates were predominantly resistant to penicillin based antibiotics and co-trimoxazole but sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones. a high percentage of s. aureus isolates were multi-drug resistant. conclusions: bacterial infections contribute to the significant morbidity among children in our environment. s. aureus was more frequently isolated in sepsis while h. influenzae appears to play a major role in meningitis. appropriate use of antibiotics is needed to manage affected children effectively. we also recommend improved vaccine coverage of children under the age of five years.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the influence of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. a potassium salt of cla (cla-k) was tested  against three gram-positive strains ( bacillus cereus , staphylococcus aureus , and streptococcus mutans ) and five gram-negative strains ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , salmonella typhimurium , vibrio parahemolyticus , klebsiella pneumoniae , and proteus mirabilis ). cla-k-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the gram-positive strains. the ic(50) value of cla-k was 0.3 mm for b. cereus, 1.2 mm for s. aureus, and 0.3 mm  for s. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mm for k. pneumoniae, 1.2 mm for p. aeruginosa, 1.8 mm for s. typhimurium, 1.8 mm for v. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mm  for p. mirabilis. the cla-k delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower cla-k concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. all cells grown in the medium containing cla-k contained cla in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in gram-positive than gram-negative strains. higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (ldh), protein content, and malondialdehyde (mda) content  were evident in gram-positive strains than in gram-negative strains. these results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by cla mediated through the lipid peroxidation of cla in the membranes and in the medium.

TI  == piscidin 4, a novel member of the piscidin family of antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == piscidins are linear, amphipathic, antimicrobial peptides (amps) with broad, potent, activity spectrum. piscidins and other members of the piscidin family appear to comprise the most common group of amps in teleost fish. all piscidins and related members of the piscidin family described to date are 18-26 amino acids long.we report here the isolation of a novel 5329.25 da, 44-residue (ffrhlfrgakaifrgarqgxrahkvvsryrnrdvpetdnnqeep) antimicrobial peptide from hybrid  striped bass (morone chrysops female x m. saxatilis male).we have named this peptide "piscidin 4" since it has considerable (to >65%) n-terminal sequence homology to piscidins 1-3 and this distinctive, 10 to 11-residue, n-terminus is characteristic of piscidins. the native peptide has a modified amino acid at position 20 that, based upon mass spectrometry data, is probably a hydroxylated tryptophan. synthetic piscidin 4 (with an unmodified tryptophan at position 20) has similar antibacterial activity to that of the native peptide. piscidin 4 demonstrates potent, broad-spectrum, antibacterial activity against a number of fish and human pathogens, including multi-drug resistant bacteria. its potent antimicrobial activity suggests that piscidin 4 plays a significant role in the innate defense system of hybrid striped bass.

TI  == 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying common uropathogens: a metabolic approach to the urinary tract infection.
AB  == objective: to address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (uti), we used 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia and proteus mirabilis. patients, subjects and methods: urine samples from patients with suspected uti (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of e. coli, k. pneumonia, p. aeruginosa, enterobacter, acinobacter, pr. mirabilis, citrobacter frundii, streptococcus saprophyticus and enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003  and 2006. 1h-nmr spectra were recorded on a 400 mhz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. all urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by nmr spectroscopy. results: preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the  unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of e. coli, 92% (101/110) of k. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of p. aeruginosa and eight of 10 pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with nmr (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). the remaining samples were  sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. the nmr method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) cfu. conclusions: the identification of the common uropathogens e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and pr. mirabilis by nmr spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.

TI  == a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  == it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the  bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have  identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies.  this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.

TI  == [the analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to fess method].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

TI  == the establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == comparative activity of meropenem in us medical centers (2007): initiating the 2nd decade of mystic program surveillance.
AB  == since 1997, the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program has monitored the antimicrobial activity of broad-spectrum agents against pathogens from hospitalized patients. in the united states, 2894 isolates were submitted in 2007 from 15 sites, including 1392 enterobacteriaceae, 643 nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, and 829 gram-positive cocci. all isolates were tested by broth microdilution methods. meropenem (mic(90) range, 0.12-2 microg/ml) exhibited the lowest resistance rates (1.9-2.4%) against enterobacteriaceae, and fluoroquinolones had the highest rates of resistance (17.3-18.3%). kpc carbapenemases, usually found in klebsiella pneumoniae, were also detected in citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli. confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolate rates for e. coli, klebsiella spp., and proteus mirabilis isolates were 6.0%, 12.0%, and 0.0%, respectively. meropenem remained active against gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococci (methicillin-susceptible; mic(90), 0.12-0.25 microg/ml), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml), and beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci (mic(90) range, 0.06-0.25 microg/ml). these us mystic program results demonstrate the continued emergence of novel beta-lactamases and  multidrug-resistant bacterial phenotypes necessitating monitoring of carbapenem activities against enterobacteriaceae species as well as nonfermentative bacilli.

TI  == in vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of h2 receptor antagonists.
AB  == enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces  its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme dna gyrase. there are a number of drug  interactions reported for enoxacin. on the other hand h2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. as the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. in present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a b.p. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and h2-receptor antagonists alone. the interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. these studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (ph 9) and buffers of ph 7.4 simulating blood ph at 37 degrees c. in order to support these interaction studies, the effect of  h2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (mic) of enoxacin was also  studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against staphylococcus  aureus, streptococcus pyogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and bacillus subtilis. on the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with h2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in mic of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.

AB  == war wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas  to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. war wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types  of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. this environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. war wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. the infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection.  these are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. the determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. the etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. staphylococcus spp, streptococcus spp and enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family enterobacteriacea (escherichia coil, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus -  a. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; peptostreptococcus spp and peptococcus spp. the latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered  to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. the choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. it is  used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. the characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. the use of antibiotics is not a  substitution for surgical treatment. the expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. if the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. the keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == there is a low incidence of recurrent bacteriuria in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis patients followed longitudinally.
AB  == the objective of this paper was to establish whether patients with confirmed painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (pbs/ic) presenting with symptoms  of uti have actual bacteriuria vs a flare of their pbs/ic symptoms. one hundred and six (n = 106) consecutive female patients (mean age 39.8 +/- 14 years) with newly diagnosed ic were identified and followed longitudinally for 24 months. at  the initial visit and at all subsequent visits, urinary specimens were obtained by sterile catheterization (bard 14fr female) and cultured for bacteria. eight patients had an initially positive urine culture, and repeat cultures 8 weeks after treatment were all negative. once sterile urine was established, the diagnosis of pbs/ic was confirmed. a pelvic pain/urgency/frequency (puf) questionnaire score was obtained from 89 patients. after the diagnosis of pbs/ic, all patients received multimodal treatment. patients were instructed to present to the office whenever they developed symptoms of uti, at which time a sterile catheter specimen was obtained and sent for culture. greater than 10(3) colonies  were considered positive. patients who did not report flares were contacted to establish whether unreported treatments were given. seventy-two patients (68%) had no uti episodes or flares. the remaining 34 patients (32%) presented with 54  flares, of which 44 were culture-negative and 10 were culture-positive. a single  flare was reported by 21 patients during the 24 months, with three positive cultures (14.3%). recurrent uti symptoms (two to four flares) were seen in a small group (n = 13) for a total of 33 flares. of these, seven had two flares each (12 negative, 2 positive), five had three flares each (12 negative, 3 positive), and one patient had four flares (two negative, two positive). therefore, within the group with recurrent symptoms, seven positive cultures were obtained for a rate of recurrent bacteriuria of 6.6% (7/106). nine of the 10 positive bacterial cultures were due to gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli  (n = 6), proteus mirabilis (n = 1), klebsiella pneumonia (n = 1), and citrobacter sp. (n = 1). one grew streptococcus sp. there was no difference between the flare group and nonflares in regards to age or puf scores between groups. this study is the first to report on the low incidence of confirmed utis in a large group of pbs/ic patients followed longitudinally. these data suggest that only a small number of pbs/ic patients with uti symptoms have positive urine cultures (9.4%; 10/106). although the symptoms of recurrent uti are prevalent in ic patients, the incidence of confirmed recurrent utis is only 6.6%. because the flares of ic are  usually self-limiting, treatment response to antibiotics may be misleading in light of the low incidence of positive urine cultures. these data suggest that the symptom flares of ic are not usually associated with recurrent uti and, therefore, are likely due to a triggering of the other painful mechanisms involved in ic patients who are culture-negative.

TI  == assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program on 3 continents.
AB  == selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use  in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. the purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3  continents using data from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. a total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. with a  protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or  =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. broth microdilution methods and current clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint criteria were used. the 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in north america (27.4%) and europe (19.0%), but escherichia coli was most common in latin america (19.3%). all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from north america and latin america were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. however, 2 s. pneumoniae strains from italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/ml). ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci  were clonal. numerous strains of klebsiella spp. (22.5%), e. coli (4.5%), and proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from latin america and 1 from europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 p. aeruginosa isolates from turkey were resistant to polymyxin b (> or =4 microg/ml), and 8.7% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from latin america were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because  new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age  group.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == [epidemiology and etiology of urinary tract infections in the community. antimicrobial susceptibility of the main pathogens and clinical significance of resistance].
AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) are a frequent problem in primary care. they occur mainly in women without underlying diseases and with no functional or structural  anomalies of the urinary tract; consequently most cases are considered uncomplicated uti. etiology is influenced by factors such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, urinary catheterization, and other factors. escherichia coli  causes 80-85% of acute episodes of uncomplicated cystitis. staphylococcus saprophyticus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus agalactiae and klebsiella spp. are responsible for most of the remaining episodes. the spectrum of bacteria that causes complicated uti is much broader. rates of resistance have undergone considerable variations, and consequently the empirical treatment of uti requires constant updating of the antibiotic sensitivity of the main uropathogens of the area, country or institution. to correctly interpret the global data on sensitivity, the type of uti (uncomplicated versus complicated), sex, age and previous antibiotic therapy in each patient must be taken into account. resistance in uncomplicated uti has clinical significance (although less than in  systemic infections such as bacteremia), which depends on whether the infection is cystitis or pyelonephritis.

TI  == [clinical effect of continuous infusion of meropenem on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly].
AB  == we studied the clinical effect of continuous infusion over 24 hours of meropenem  (mepm) on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly (over 65). the subjects were 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, n = 9; severe, n= 4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group iii, n = 13) whose performance status was 3 or 4. mepm 1.0g/day was infused continuously for 7-14 days, and its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy, and side effects were examined prospectively. it was effective in 23 of the 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, 8/9; severe, 3/4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group iii, 12/13; efficacy rate: 88.5%). bactericidal effects were obtained in 3 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of methicillin-sensitive staphlococcus aureus, 1 strain of streptococcus agalactiae  and 1 strain of proteus mirabilis, but not in 2 strains of methicillin-resistant  s. aureus, 1 strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1 strain of serratia marcescens. mild abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 2 patients: elevation of gpt, gamma-gtp, bun and elevation of alp. based on the above, continuous infusion of mepm on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly obtained excellent clinical effects. further study is needed to compare the efficacy of continuous versus intermittent administration of mepm.

AB  == objective: to compare bact/alert (bta) and bactec 9240 (bac), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. materials and methods:  blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented bta and bac standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. the time to growth detection (td) was recorded for each bottle that became positive.  a quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess td of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. results: a total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both bta and bac bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by bta bottles and 13 (56.5%) by bac. proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the bta system. the average tds were 19.0 and 24.6 h for bta and bac, respectively. analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same  for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa but slightly different for haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. the anaerobic  bottle ofthe bta did not support the growth of h. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) cfu/ml whereas the bac did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) cfu/ml. td for  s. pneumoniae in the bta was about half of that in the bac. conclusions: the bta  system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the bac system to detect the same organism.

AB  == necrotizing fasciitis (nf) is a potentially lethal soft tissue infection characterized by cutaneous necrosis, suppurative fasciitis, vascular thrombosis and extreme systemic toxicity. it is a rare entity in the head and neck region, but occur most frequently in patients with diabetes and chronic alcoholism. mostly involved are immunodeficient patients with banal infections of the upper aerodigestive tract, small traumas, but also after surgical procedures. necrotizing fasciitis is an infection caused by aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms. a strong complication is a streptococcus-associated-toxic shock-syndrome which should be prevented because it is often associated with letal outcome. septicemia and systemic toxic effects may lead to death within as  short a time as 2 to 4 days. necrotizing fasciitis is often misdiagnosed or the diagnosis is delayed with a mortality rate of approximately 30-70%. once identified, treatment consists of antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement  followed at a later date with reconstructive surgery. we present a fatal case of  craniofacial necrotizing fasciitis (nf) in a 63-year-old diabetic and chronic alcoholic man and discuss it's pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and the best therapeutic choice for this disease. a review of the literature with the clinical presentations, bacteriology diagnosis and treatment was presented.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human american tegumentary leishmaniasis in minas gerais, brazil.
AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

TI  == granulomatous inflammation of salt glands in ducklings (anas platyrhynchos) associated with intralesional gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the "nasal glands" occur in many bird species and are powerful sodium ion-excretory organs. in ducks, they are located in supraorbital bony recesses. granulomatous inflammation of these glands occurs with an incidence of approximately 1% in ducklings (anas platyrhynchos), and is not associated with specific clinical symptoms. we investigated nine glands of eight animals with granulomas by gross pathology and histopathology, and compared results of bacteriology with 20 non-lesioned nasal glands. adenitis was characterized by multifocal to coalescent heterophilic granulomas with central necrotic heterophils, and multinucleate giant cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells. within  the centres of the granulomas, there were clusters of gram-negative bacteria that were identified as halo-tolerant pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and aeromonas hydrophila. normal glands contained exclusively various halo-tolerant gram-positive bacteria, mostly streptococcus sp. and enterococcus sp. the distribution of lesions and lack of clinical symptoms were suggestive of a localized ascending infection via the secretory ductules.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was  comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella  catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced  infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising  candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.

TI  == bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  == blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in akwa ibom state and analyzed for the presence of salmonella species and other bacteria. of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. female subjects were more infected than males. the commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, salmonella paratyphi and salmonella typhi. s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, k. aerogenes, s. faecalis, proteus mirabilis and p. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were s. aureus, e. coli, s. typhi, s. paratyphi, shigella sp, k. pneumoniae, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and vibrio cholerae 01. the isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. these antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. the results suggest the existence  of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. this is worrisome, since some of the s. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == detection of paragonimus heterotremus eggs in experimentally infected cats by a polymerase chain reaction-based method.
AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) procedure for the detection of paragonimus heterotremus eggs in stool samples was developed and compared with stoll's egg count method. the primers were designed on the basis of a previously constructed  pph-13-specific dna probe, which produced an approximate 0.5-kb amplified product. this pcr method could detect as few as 5 eggs in 0.6 g of artificially inoculated feces of a healthy control cat or as little as 1 x 10(-4) ng of p. heterotremus genomic dna. the assay had 100% sensitivity in all infected cats. the method did not yield an approximate 0.5-kb product with dna from other parasites such as gnathostoma spinigerum, trichinella spiralis, fasciola gigantica, echinostoma malayanum, opisthorchis viverrini, dirofilaria immitis, and taenia saginata; exceptions were paragonimus siamensis and paragonimus westermani. in addition, no genomic dna from escherichia coli, burkholderia pseudomallei, acinetobacter anitratus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, beta-streptococcus gra, and proteus mirabilis or from the vertebrate and  invertebrate hosts of p. heterotremus was amplified in the pcr assay. this assay  has great potential for application in clinical epidemiological studies.

TI  == chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  == objectives: although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely  clarified. using n-chlorotaurine (nct), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. it was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. methods: pathogens were incubated in nct, which was subsequently washed off. the oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. results: superficial chlorination in the form of covalent n-cl bonds to staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. for s. aureus, 3 min incubation with nct produced a cover of  3.3 x 10(-16) mol cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. the kind of microorganism, coating time, ph, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. the relative cover strength on  s. aureus by nct, chloramine t, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or n,n-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees c (>8 h at 1 degrees c), even  without a reduction of cfu. however, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal nh(2)cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. conclusions: the chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. furthermore, it may be a decisive  step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.

TI  == (1)h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  == the utility of (1)h nmr spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (uti). the specific property of p. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-ohna) is exploited. the quantity of 6-ohna produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter frundii, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. the method provides a single-step documentation of p. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. the nmr method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with uti caused by p. aeruginosa.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of ibafloxacin in micro-organisms isolated from cats.
AB  == the pharmacodynamic properties of ibafloxacin were investigated in micro-organisms isolated from cats. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of ibafloxacin (racemate, r- and s-enantiomers) and its metabolites (7-hydroxy- and  8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin) and time-kill kinetics were determined against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria isolated from dermal and respiratory and urinary tract infections in cats. racemic ibafloxacin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria. escherichia coli and pasteurella, klebsiella and staphylococcus spp. are commonly isolated from feline infections and all are susceptible to ibafloxacin (mic90 < or = 0.5 microg/ml), whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus spp. are considered intrinsic resistant. microbiological activity resides primarily in the s-enantiomer of ibafloxacin whereas the r-enantiomer is  less active. killing curves using concentrations of racemic ibafloxacin and 8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin, which are representative of the in vivo situation observed in cats, showed at least 99.9% reduction in viable bacterial isolates from feline clinical samples over 24 h. bacterial eradication was achieved in cats with cmax/mic and auc/mic values much lower than the target values previously established in man and laboratory animals. additional studies in dogs and cats are necessary to define more clearly the surrogate markers of antibacterial activity (i.e. cmax/mic, auc/mic ratios), which are associated with a good clinical response.

AB  == background: globally icus are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. methods: antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant icu pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from the surveillance network (tsn) databases in europe (france, germany and italy), canada, and the united states (us). results: oxacillin resistance rates among staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. penicillin resistance  rates among streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in germany to as high as 20.2% in the us; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in germany to 3.4% in italy. vancomycin resistance rates among enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in france to 76.3% in the united states. putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production among enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among escherichia coli in the five countries studied. ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower  than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the enterobacteriaceae species examined. fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for e. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). p. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. imipenem was the most active compound tested against acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. conclusion: there was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. compared with other countries, italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of enterococcus spp., which were highest in the us. this data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in europe and north america and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.

TI  == isolation of bacteriophages from the oral cavity.
AB  == aims: to isolate bacteriophages lytic for oral pathogens from human saliva, dental plaque and mature biofilms constituted from saliva-derived bacteria. methods and results: saliva and dental plaque samples from healthy volunteers and from patients with gingivitis and periodontitis were examined for the presence of lytic bacteriophage using a panel of oral pathogens and bacteria isolated from the samples. samples were also enriched for bacteriophage using static culture techniques and mature biofilms. a limited number of samples contained bacteriophage particles that were visualized using electron microscopy. cultures  yielded phage infecting non-oral bacteria (proteus mirabilis) but no bacteriophage specific for recognized oral pathogens were found. some micro-organisms from the oral microflora elaborated antibacterial substances that inhibited growth of other residents of the oral cavity. conclusions: unlike other ecosystems, the composition of the oral cavity does not appear to be heavily influenced by interactions between bacteriophages and their hosts. significance and impact of the study: bacteriophage for control of oral infections may need to be obtained from other sources. antibacterial substances derived from some members of the oral microflora warrant investigation as potential antibiotics.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == effect of moxifloxacin on bacterial pathogenicity factors in comparison with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone.
AB  == moxifloxacin is a recent fluoroquinolone with an antibacterial spectrum encompassing both aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive strains, as well as anaerobic bacteria. in this study the activity of moxifloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and effects of subinhibitory concentrations on bacterial morphology and adhesion properties were compared with those of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone. the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive and  gram-negative pathogens was equal to or better than that of comparators. subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin significantly affected bacterial morphology of s. pneumoniae, m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa, leading to formation of spherical forms and filaments. moreover, bacterial adhesion to buccal cells and fibroblasts was reduced after treatment with 1/4 and 1/8 x mic of moxifloxacin. in conclusion, subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin remarkably interfere with some bacterial pathogenic factors, thereby contributing to its antimicrobial activity.

TI  == [bacterial colonization of chronic wounds. studies on outpatients in a university dermatology clinic with special consideration of orsa].
AB  == in this retrospective investigation, we documented the bacterial colonization of  79 patients with chronic wounds, who had been treated between january 2002 and may 2003 in an outpatient wound healing clinic of a university dermatology program. we isolated 106 facultative pathogenic bacterial strains of which 56 were staphylococcus aureus, 19 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11 escherichia coli, 4 proteus mirabilis, 4 enterobacter cloacae, 2 serratia marcescens, 2 streptococcus group g und 8 further species. 68 of these bacterial strains were gram-positive and 46 gram-negative. moreover we identified one patient with candida parapsilosis. therefore, 70.8% of all patients showed staphylococcus aureus in their chronic wounds. determination of the specific resistances showed 17 patients to be colonized with oxacillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus (orsa) strain; this corresponds to 21.5% of all patients. consequently, 30.4% of all staphylococcus aureus isolates were orsa strains. all of the orsa isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. sensitivity to tetracycline was documented in 15, to amikacin in 13, to clindamycin in 7, to gentamicin and erythromycin in 6 of the orsa-positive patients. in the case of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 10 were sensitive and 3 were intermediate in sensitivity. beside the obligate resistance  to oxacillin, penicillin g, ampicillin, cefuroxime and imipenem, none of the orsa was sensitive to ofloxacin. the results of our investigations demonstrate the actual spectrum of bacterial colonization in chronic wounds of patients in an university dermatologic wound clinic and underline the growing problem of orsa.

TI  == susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  == the aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. we created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 january, 1990 through 31 december, 2000). improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and  to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. during the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). the mean annual number  of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). the 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: escherichia coli (1494), staphylococcus aureus (1240), klebsiella pneumoniae (779), enterococcus spp. (631), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (488), streptococcus pneumoniae (447), enterobacter spp. (338), acinetobacter spp. (298), proteus mirabilis (260) and candida spp. (254). no significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations)  per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was e. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was candida (1, 0.3). forty percent of organisms (n=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ed), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (icus). trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ed enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the icu isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. the difference in susceptibility between ed and icu isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (p<0.001). a significant decrease in the susceptibility of e coli  to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. in k. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of k. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all  traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. susceptibility of s. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (p<0.001). marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.

TI  == trends in fluoroquinolone resistance of bacteria isolated from canine urinary tracts.
AB  == fluoroquinolone (fq) antimicrobial agents are used extensively in human and veterinary medicine. widespread use of any antimicrobial agent can apply selective pressure on populations of bacteria, which may result in an increase in the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant isolates. antimicrobial-susceptibility  data on bacteria isolated from the canine urinary tract by the university of missouri-columbia veterinary medical diagnostic laboratory, columbia, mo, were used to determine whether there has been an increase in the prevalence of fq-resistant bacteria over time. between january 1992 and december 2001, minimum  inhibitory concentrations of either ciprofloxacin (1992-1998) or enrofloxacin (1998-2001) were determined for 1,478 bacterial isolates from the canine urinary  tract. the predominant bacterial species isolated were escherichia coli (547 isolates), proteus mirabilis (156), and staphylococcus intermedius (147). in all, there were 13 bacterial species with more than 25 isolates each. a significant increase in the overall proportion of resistant bacterial isolates was documented from 1992 to 2001 (cochran-armitage test for trend, p < 0.0001). the same increase in resistant isolates was documented when either ciprofloxacin or enrofloxacin was analyzed separately (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0002, respectively). no difference was detected in rates of bacterial fq resistance with regard to the sex of the dog from which the bacteria were isolated. the frequency with which some bacterial species were isolated differed with the sex of the infected dog. proteus mirabilis was found more often in females (p < 0.0001), whereas beta hemolytic streptococcus spp., were found more often in males (p = 0.0003). although the overall efficacy of fq antimicrobials remained high with greater than 80% of isolates being susceptible, the data demonstrated an increase in the  proportion of resistant bacteria isolated from the urinary tract of the dog.

AB  == as a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; activity against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter and klebsiella species; low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. its spectrum is very large being very active against gram-negative bacilii: enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia, citrobacter, proteus mirabilis and less active against bacillus fragillis. cefepime is also very active against gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes. some of the methicillin-resistant strains of  staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; enterococcus is resistant. due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases cefepime (maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum.
AB  == background: necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum is a fulminant, life-threatening condition. this infection is usually polymicrobial and may be idiopathic or secondary to local trauma or surgery. histologically, it is characterized by obliterative endarteritis and thrombosis of the subcutaneous vessels, fascial necrosis, and leukocytic infiltration. mortality rates of 25-75% have been reported. most cases of necrotizing gangrene begin insidiously, with scrotal discomfort and malaise. later, erythema, increasing pain, and swelling, associated with fever and chills, develop. a biopsy is useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to obtain culture samples. ultrasound imaging may reveal gas or testicular involvement and may help to distinguish this infection from other causes of scrotal pathology. materials and methods: fifteen patients with necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum, seen at the dermatology and plastic surgery sections of our institutions between 1994 and 1999, are described. results: this series included 11 men (73%) and four women (27%), aged  39-68 years (mean, 51 years). in our series, clostridium perfingens, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus viridans, acinetobacter baumani, escherichia coli, and candida albicans were isolated. hemodynamic stabilization and monitoring were performed in all patients. intravenous antimicrobial therapy was promptly instituted. in most cases, two or more drugs were used. concurrent surgical debridement of all necrotic areas was always required. when needed, split-thickness skin grafts were used to cover the penile shaft. expanded mesh grafts were used to reconstruct the vulva and other denuded beds. the survival rate in this series was 87%. conclusions: necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum continues to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. the usual polymicrobial infection with vascular involvement demands hemodynamic stabilization, systemic antimicrobial therapy, and surgical debridement. in some patients, genital, perineal, and abdominal wall reconstruction is also required.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dequalinium chloride against leading germs of vaginal infections.
AB  == dequalinium chloride (cas 522-51-0) and povidone iodine (cas 25655-41-8) are known as antiseptic agents and used in the local treatment of vaginal infections. clotrimazole (cas 23593-75-1) is an anti-fungal drug and applied primarily in the therapy of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis and to a lesser extent in bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis. however, antimicrobial activities of those three agents in comparison to each other have not been reported so far. to address this issue the antimicrobial activities of these agents against 18 germs relevant to vaginal infections were determined. the tested species are representatives of the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus, listeria, escherichia, proteus, gardnerella, bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, candida, and trichomonas. all micro-organisms were susceptible to dequalinium chloride with the exception of proteus mirabilis. at a given dose, the activity of dequalinium  chloride was higher as compared to the other substances. in view of its wide antimicrobial spectrum dequalinium chloride is an efficient alternative in the local therapy of vaginal infections such as fluor vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis, vulvo-vaginal candidiasis and trichomoniasis.

TI  == proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria degrade and inactivate the antibacterial peptide ll-37.
AB  == effectors of the innate immune system, the anti-bacterial peptides, have pivotal  roles in preventing infection at epithelial surfaces. here we show that proteinases of the significant human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pyogenes, degrade the  antibacterial peptide ll-37. analysis by mass spectrometry of fragments generated by p. aeruginosa elastase in vitro revealed that the initial cleavages occurred at asn-leu and asp-phe, followed by two breaks at arg-ile, thus inactivating the  peptide. proteinases of the other pathogens also degraded ll-37 as determined by  sds-page. ex vivo, p. aeruginosa elastase induced ll-37 degradation in human wound fluid, leading to enhanced bacterial survival. the degradation was blocked  by the metalloproteinase inhibitors gm6001 and 1, 10-phenantroline (both of which inhibited p. aeruginosa elastase, p. mirabilis proteinase, and e. faecalis gelatinase), or the inhibitor e64 (which inhibited s. pyogenes cysteine proteinase). additional experiments demonstrated that dermatan sulphate and disaccharides of the structure [deltaua(2s)-galnac(4,6s)], or sucroseoctasulphate, inhibited the degradation of ll-37. the results indicate that proteolytic degradation of ll-37 is a common virulence mechanism and that molecules which block this degradation could have therapeutic potential.

TI  == intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to  human subjects. methods: thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. the indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole  (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results: all the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by hplc. the level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. a mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. the level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. conclusion: the vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic(90)) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the mic(90) against proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterobacter spp.

TI  == antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity of folklore: mallotus peltatus leaf  extract.
AB  == since ages mallotus peltatus (geist) muell. arg. var acuminatus (euphorbiaceae) leaf and stem bark is used in folk medicine to cure intestinal ailments and skin  infections. in several intestinal ailments, localized inflammation is of common occurrence and hence we have evaluated the antimicrobial as well as anti-inflammatory activity of m. peltatus leaf extract. the crude methanol extract of m. peltatus leaves was found to be active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis,  escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis and the dermatophytic fungi microsporum gypseum. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) ranges from 128 to 2000 microg ml(-1) for bacteria and 128 mg ml(-1) for fungi, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was 2-4-fold higher than mic. the methanol-water fraction of the extract showed similar activity against staphylococcus, streptococcus, bacillus and proteus isolates. the anti-inflammatory activity of the extract against carrageenan (acute model) and dextran-induced (subacute model) rat paw oedema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma (chronic model) in rats were studied using indomethacin (10 mg kg(-1)), a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug, as standard. the methanol extract at 200 and 400 mg kg(-1), and the n-butanol fractions a and b at 25 mg kg(-1), exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity in albino rats, compared with indomethacin. phytochemical study revealed the presence of tannins, saponins, terpenoids, steroids and reducing sugars in the crude extract while the n-butanol fractions showed the presence of ursolic acid, beta-sitosterol and some fatty acids as major compounds. further study with fractions showed that the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity is due to either fraction a (ursolic acid) alone or the combination of fractions a and b (beta-sitosterol and fatty acids) of the extract.

TI  == community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults: the epidemiology, timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and prognostic factors.
AB  == between january 1986 and december 1999, 109 adult patients with culture-proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital. to compare changes over time, the appearance of disease among  our patients was divided into two equal time periods: an earlier time period (1986-1992) and a later time period (1993-1999). in this study, there was a decreasing proportion of community-acquired bacterial meningitis compared with nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adult patients in recent years. its proportion declined dramatically from 81% in the earlier 7 years to 37% in the later 7 years. of the pathogens, klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae was the most frequently implicated pathogen, followed by viridans (v.) streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. other rare organisms including acinetobacter baumannii, salmonella group b and d, proteus mirabilis, group b, d, and non-a, non-b and non-d streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci emerged during the second period. there was a decrease in the mortality rate from 44% in the first to 34% in the second time period, but the overall mortality rate remained high. of the implicated pathogens, patients infected with v. streptococci had a consistently favorable prognosis, while a dramatic decrease in the mortality rate of those infected with k. pneumoniae was seen in recent years. in the multiple logistic regression analysis, only the presence of septic shock and seizures was independently associated with mortality. the timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as defined by consciousness level, was a major determinant of survival and neurological outcomes for patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic should be administrated before a patient's consciousness deteriorates  to a glasgow coma scale score lower than 10.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

AB  == background and objective: biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. patients and methods: in this study, bioverit, al2o3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and candida albicans. results: in the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and candida albicans were not affected. the al2o3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. streptococcus  pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. in contrast, bioverit and al2o3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. conclusions: in conclusion, we think that bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.

TI  == [pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  == the bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by streptococcus faecalis (11%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and proteus mirabilis (6%). results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary  infections in children. fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. in hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. these treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.

TI  == the influence of plasma on the disinfecting activity of the new antimicrobial agent n-chlorotaurine-sodium in comparison with chloramine t.
AB  == the phenomenon of increasing bactericidal activity of n-chlorotaurine in the presence of chlorine-consuming material has been investigated both on a chemical-analytical and microbiological basis using plasma as substrate and chloramine t for comparison. chlorine consumption assessed by iodometric titration showed a biphasic time-course with a very fast loss of oxidation capacity within one minute (n-chlorotaurine: -9.3%, chloramine t: -16.8%) followed by a slow loss which could still be detected after 24 h (total loss -61.7% and -74.1%, respectively). killing curves revealed that an increase in bactericidal activity, in spite of improved consumption, did not occur with all strains, and could be detected only at a certain degree of consumption. escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the most pronounced effect, streptococcus pyogenes and proteus mirabilis a medium-sized one, while it was absent in staphylococcus aureus. with chloramine t, an increase in bactericidal activity could not be proved. the chemical basis of these consumption effects can be reduced to four reaction types: oxidation of thiols; chlorine substitution of  activated c-h compounds; transhalogenation; and hydrolytic degradation of n-chloro-alpha-amino acids and -peptides emerging by transhalogenation. the initial fast loss of oxidation capacity can be attributed mainly to oxidation of  thiols, while the subsequent slower decrease is caused by the other types of reaction. the increase in bactericidal activity, on the other hand, can be explained by transhalogenation, leading to the formation of more bactericidal n-chloro compounds by which the loss of n-chlorotaurine is over-compensated.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of topical ofloxacin and other ototopical agents.
AB  == background: ototopical agents are extensively used for otitis externa (oe), acute otitis media identified by otorrhea in patients who have tympanostomy tubes (aom-tt) and chronic suppurative otitis media (csom). the quinolones have particular value as ototopical agents because of the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity of importance in otic diseases and the high concentrations of antibacterial activity at the site of infection. methods: a survey of literature on in vitro activity and microbiologic efficacy in clinical trials of  quinolone otic products for oe, aom-tt and csom. results: oe: floxin otic and cortisporin tc otic suspension were equally effective in eradicating the three major pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus. csom: ofloxacin otic was effective in an open label trial in uniform eradication of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter spp.  aom-tt: ofloxacin otic and amoxicillin/clavulanate (by mouth) were equivalent clinically; rates of eradication of initial pathogens were similar for streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, but ofloxacin otic was superior in eradication of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa conclusions: in each of the studies of oe, csom and aom-tt, ofloxacin otic solution was effective in eradicating the bacterial pathogen from the site of infection: equivalent to cortisporin for children with oe; superior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for patients with aom-tt who had acute drainage; and effective in eradicating bacterial pathogens from the external canal of patients  with csom.

TI  == resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  == multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. among gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. important causes of gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation  cephalosporin (amp c) beta-lactamase resistance among enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. in selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should  not further promote the development of resistance. recent data suggest that because of esbls and high-level amp c beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. in addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. the role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. in addition, several new agents with good  activity against gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.

TI  == acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute  otitis media are treated with antibiotics. methods: a multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. setting: nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. results: prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. cultures were negative in 60 patients. the organisms isolated  in the 92 positive cultures were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), haemophilus influenzae (four patients), proteus mirabilis (two patients), escherichia coli (two patients), klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient),  enterobacter (one patient), acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative  bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). ten patients had mixed flora. sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). conclusions: antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. the distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.

TI  == characteristics of neonatal bacterial meningitis in a teaching hospital in taiwan from 1984-1997.
AB  == during the period from 1984 to 1997, 85 bacterial meningitis neonates with positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures were treated. the ages of these patients ranged from 1 to 28 days. the male to female ratio was 1.7 to 1. the most common  causative agent was group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs, 31.8%), followed by escherichia coli (20%), proteus mirabilis (7.1%), enterobacter cloacae (5.9%), other streptococci excluding streptococcus pneumoniae (5.9%), chryseobacterium meningosepticum (5.9%), enterococci (4.7%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). among the 85 patients treated, 51 (60%) were younger than 7 days old. among them, dyspnea was the most common clinical manifestation. in contrast, fever and diarrhea were seen more frequently in neonates with late onset of disease (after  seven days of age). ampicillin and cefotaxime were the most commonly used antibiotics. the most frequently encountered complications were hydrocephalus and seizures. since 1991, gbs has overtaken e. coli as the leading cause of neonatal  bacterial meningitis. this was accompanied by a fall in the mortality rate, but a sustained high incidence of complications and sequelae. the results of this study highlight the importance of developing strategies to prevent group b streptococcal infection.

TI  == culture independent and rapid identification of bacterial pathogens in necrotising fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome by fluorescence in situ hybridisation.
AB  == fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) targeted to ribosomal rna is well established for studies in environmental microbiology. initial applications of this technique in the field of medical microbiology showed that fish is also a suitable means for the rapid, reliable and cultivation-independent identification of bacterial pathogens. in particular, for infectious diseases that follow a fulminant live-threatening course, such as sepsis or necrotising fasciitis (nf),  a fast and reliable detection technique is of great importance. this study describes the development of an rrna-targeted oligonucleotide set covering more than 95% of the pathogens associated with nf. these probes were tested with a broad collection of target and non-target organisms and found to be highly specific. subsequently, the fish approach was applied for the direct detection of bacterial pathogens in clinical samples. two cases of nf and one case of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (stss) were analysed. fish correctly identified almost all pathogens present in the samples examined within 2-3 h. however, proteus mirabilis, which was identified in one sample by conventional methods was detected as a rod-shaped bacteria but could not be identified by fish, since no specific probe was available for this particular organism. in contrast, identification of pathogens in these samples by conventional laboratory methods took 48-72 h. furthermore, in one patient with pre-sampling antimicrobial therapy bacteria could not be grown from any of the samples. fish unequivocally revealed the presence of streptococcus pyogenes in affected tissue samples from this patient. in an experimental setting we demonstrated that fish readily identifies s. pyogenes cells rendered non-cultivable by antibiotic treatment.

AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was studied in the united states and the netherlands. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of ph on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. the mics of american and dutch isolates agreed  in general. the mics of the american gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 microg/ml, and the mics of the dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.016 to 8.0 microg/ml. a few european strains of proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high mics. bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to difloxacin. the mics of the american gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.125 to 4.0 microg/ml, and the mics of dutch isolates ranged from 0.125 to  2.0 microg/ ml. difloxacin induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0.2-3 hours in cultures with escherichia coli, staphylococcus  intermedius, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. there  was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine pseudomonas aeruginosa. decreasing the ph of the medium increased the mic of proteus mirabilis for difloxacin. the mics of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral ph and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. at a neutral ph, most tested bacterial species were killed at a difloxacin concentration of 4  times the mic. similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. a klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at difloxacin or enrofloxacin mic, but at neutral ph the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the mic for a bactericidal effect. after 24 hours of incubation at ph 7.1, difloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar bactericidal activity for all bacteria tested except staphylococcus intermedius.  against s. intermedius, difloxacin was more bactericidal than enrofloxacin.

TI  == comparative efficacy of gemifloxacin in experimental models of pyelonephritis and wound infection.
AB  == gemifloxacin (sb-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis) and gram-positive wound infection resulting from streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis or staphylococcus aureus. gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin,  grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. in the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (p < 0.01) compared with no treatment. no comparator agent  had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (p < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against e. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were  inferior (p < 0.01) against p. mirabilis infection. in the s. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (p <  0.01). results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (p > 0.05). gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (p < 0.01). no comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against s. pyogenes or s. aureus infections. these data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of  gram-negative urinary tract infection and gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.

AB  == background: infectious complications in severe pancreatitis are the main factors  determining clinical course and outcome. the taurocholate model for acute necrotizing pancreatitis was evaluated for frequency and time course of pancreatic and extrapancreatic bacterial infection. methods: sixty-five male wistar rats were divided into 5 groups of 13 animals each. specimens for bacteriologic examination were taken, and pancreatitis was induced by intraductal infusion of 3% taurocholate under sterile conditions. animals were killed 8, 16,  24, or 32 hours thereafter, and bacteriologic examination was performed. a control group of animals with intraductal infusion of 0.9% saline solution were killed after 32 hours. results: there was no significant pancreatic infection in  the control group and in the 8-hour group (1 of 13 rats). sixteen and 24 hours after induction of pancreatitis, infection and inflammation of the pancreas were  found in 77% (10 of 13 rats), and after 32 hours pancreatic infection occurred in 69% (9 of 13 rats). extrapancreatic bacterial infection after 16 hours occurred in the liver (62%), spleen (62%), and mesenteric lymph nodes (46%). bacteria infecting the pancreas reflected the bacterial spectrum of the large bowel and terminal ileum before induction of pancreatitis (escherichia coli [77%], proteus  [43%], enterococcus [37%], and staphylococcus [23%]). conclusions: pancreatic infection is an early and frequent finding in the taurocholate model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. infection occurs between 8 and 16 hours after induction of pancreatitis. the source of infecting bacteria seems to be the large bowel or  the terminal ileum. we present a useful model of severe pancreatitis in which to  study bacterial translocation, the further route of spread, and therapeutic approaches.

AB  == abstract propolis is collected by worker honey bees from the trees. the bees pack propolis on their hind legs, carry it to their colony, and use it as a sterilant  in the hive. propolis has also been used by humans since early times for various  purposes and, especially, as a medicine because of its antimicrobial properties.  in this study, antimicrobial effects of propolis samples on three escherichia coli and two staphylococcus aureus strains that are multiresistant to antibiotics and on salmonella typhimurium, bruceila abortus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, candida tropicalis, and aspergillus niger were studied. propolis extracts were prepared with acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso). at concentrations of 10 and 25 ml, propolis extracts affected all of the  microorganisms in acetone and dmso in concentrations of 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 ppm. the results detected in this in vitro study provided evidence that propolis  may be used as an antimicrobial agent against many microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to investigate the direct influence of cigarette smoke on the bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract and the effect of supplementary vitamin e on the colonization of instilled bacteria into the trachea of rats that do not have the chronic airway pathology associated with smoking. methodology: thirty male wistar albino rats, weighing approximately 250 g, were used as experimental animals. a 0.1 ml bacterial suspension containing six bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenza, peptostreptococci spp.), isolated previously from pharynx  of rats, were instilled into the trachea of three groups of rat (10 control, 10 cigarette smoke-treated and 10 cigarette smoke- and vitamin e-supplemented rats). the smoke-treated rats were exposed to cigarette smoke for 3 days prior to and after intratracheal instillation. the third group of rats were given vitamin e supplements (100 mg/kg per day). tracheobronchial lavage samples of all rats were quantitatively cultured after 3 days from the instillation. results: the colony numbers of isolated bacteria were significantly higher in cigarette smoke-treated rats than in the control group and in the smoke- and vitamin e-supplemented rats  (p < 0.05). only s. aureus and s. epidermidis were isolated from vitamin e-supplemented rats, while instilled all six bacterial species were isolated from the other two groups. conclusions: it is concluded that smoking impairs the elimination of bacteria or facilitates colonization of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of rats. supplementary treatment with vitamin e reduces the effect of cigarette smoke; however, some bacteria may be resistant to this action of vitamin e.

AB  == objective: to examine immunological parameters that might explain disease discordance in monozygotic twin pairs with ankylosing spondylitis (as). methods:  11 monozygotic twin pairs (nine with as, two with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy) were investigated. the peripheral t cell receptor vbeta repertoire was investigated using facs analysis and 14 different vbeta antibodies. in addition serum samples were tested for antibodies to klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, candida albicans, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli. peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivity against a number of bacteria was investigated by interferon gamma elispot assays. results: twins suffering from as showed cellular hyporeactivity against k pneumoniae, s pyogenes, c albicans in the elispot assays compared with healthy twins. in contrast with the antibody data, where no significant differences were observed between the two groups, as concordant twins showed the most pronounced differences in their vbeta repertoire on cd4+ and cd8+ lymphocytes. conclusions:  cellular hyporeactivity of peripheral blood cells to bacterial antigens might reflect defective t cell responses allowing bacterial antigens to persist in diseased patients. there are probably other environmental factors that influence  disease concordance.

TI  == antibacterial activity of simple coumarins: structural requirements for biological activity.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococcus and streptococcus pneumoniae) and five gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. the coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microm. this study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. while coumarins with a methoxy function at c-7 and, if present, an oh group at either the c-6 or c-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (gram-negative microorganisms including the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus), the  presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae). a combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one  additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this animal study was to determine whether ib-367, an antimicrobial peptide, is able to ameliorate oral mucositis by reducing microflora densities on the mucosal surfaces of the mouth. study design: oral mucositis was induced in hamsters by intraperitoneal injection of 5-fluorouracil  followed by superficial abrasion of the buccal mucosa. a test formulation was applied topically to the buccal mucosa 5 or 6 times per day starting 6 to 8 hours before abrasion. results: mucositis scores were significantly lower (p < .05) in  hamsters given formulations containing 0.5 or 2.0 mg/ml of ib-367 than in placebo-treated controls. treatment with ib-367 produced a more than 100-fold reduction in oral microflora densities. in a second experiment, treatment of hamsters with a formulation containing ib-367 at 0.12, 0.5 or 2.0 mg/ml resulted  in a dose-dependent reduction in mucositis severity. conclusion: the results indicate that reduction of local microflora densities through use of ib-367 may improve clinical outcomes in patients at risk for the development of oral mucositis.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  == background: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. methods: cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. in application mode i, patients received on the day  before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. in application mode ii, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees c. the hplc method was used for measuring the concentration. results: the highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. in this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). these mean concentration are all above the mic90 of gram-negative bacteria like proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. in some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. conclusions: the mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the mic90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == the antibacterial effects of tumescent liposuction fluid.
AB  == tumescent liposuction is currently one of the most commonly performed aesthetic procedures. despite the variable use of preoperative antibiotics, infection is uncommon. prior works suggest that the low incidence of infection may be due to lidocaine's antibacterial properties. however, these properties have only been demonstrated using concentrations of lidocaine above 0.8%, significantly higher than those used in tumescent liposuction. the purpose of this study was to determine if the commonly used tumescent fluid containing 0.1% lidocaine, 1:1000,000 epinephrine, and 0.012 meq sodium bicarbonate possesses antibacterial  activity. using the broth microdilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus were determined after exposure to either lidocaine, epinephrine, bicarbonate, or the combination  of all three agents. to determine if there were significant growth differences not detectable by the broth microdilution method, bacterial concentrations were obtained through the use of a spectrophotometer, and significant differences from the controls were calculated by one-way analysis of variance. to determine if prolonged exposure to the tumescent mix would alter bacterial growth, a killing time study was also undertaken. the results indicated that the minimum inhibitory concentration of lidocaine was not less than 0.5% for any of the bacteria, whereas the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration of the combined solution was  0.25%. the lowest inhibitory concentration as determined by spectrophotometric analysis for the combined solution was 0.13% (p < 0.01). analysis of the killing  time data revealed no inhibition of bacterial growth over time. in conclusion, lidocaine, epinephrine, and bicarbonate do exhibit antibacterial properties at high concentrations. however, the commonly used tumescent mixture containing dilute concentrations of these agents does not significantly inhibit the growth of commonly encountered bacteria.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  == in adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria enterococcus, staphylococcus, streptococcus agalactiae. in rare cases the cause of infection may also be pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae. aim of the study: the aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of  urinary infections. method of the study: we isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the university children's hospital in belgrade. urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking  the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by uricult test. the samples  were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. identification was done by standard  bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious api-20e (biomerieux) was used. bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on muller-hinton agars. results: based on the obtained results, escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to  co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). discussion: it may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. however, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by escherichia coli. natural resistance to ampicillin of klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. contrary to proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus and providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics,  ampicillin was widely used. the wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. a fall in the sensitivity of klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole,  which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant klebsiella species. the sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas  aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). the most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes

AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

TI  == evaluation of use of a new chromogenic agar in detection of urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == chromagar orientation, a new chromogenic medium, was evaluated for the detection  and differentiation of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic microorganisms  in 900 urine samples from hospitalized patients. performance characteristics of the medium were evaluated in comparison to those of 5% sheep blood and macconkey  agars by direct inoculation of the urine samples on the three media. four gram-negative and two gram-positive strains as well as one yeast control strain from the american type culture collection were used to ensure quality control. chromagar orientation succeeded in detecting all the urine pathogens that were detected by the reference media, including gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci,  streptococci, and yeasts. colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation accurately differentiated escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter spp. owing to the similarity in the pigmentation produced by klebsiella, enterobacter, and citrobacter isolates, the  medium failed to distinguish among them; however, these isolates were easily recognized as coliforms because of their metallic blue coloration. staphylococci  were clearly perceptible: s. aureus and s. epidermidis grow in regular-size colonies that range from opaque white to yellowish, and s. saprophyticus produces opaque pink colonies. all streptococcus strains, including those from groups b and c, were detected. they grow as undifferentiated flat dry diffused colonies, and additional tests were required for identification. enterococci were easily discriminated by their strong turquoise pigmentation and their typical growth on  the agar's surface. yeast grow in typical creamy wet convex colonies. the accuracy of antibiotic susceptibility determinations according to standard methods was also tested by picking isolates directly from chromagar orientation.  the results showed excellent correlation with those obtained with microorganisms  picked from reference media. owing to the ease in differentiating mixed flora on  chromagar orientation, antimicrobic susceptibility tests were performed directly  from primary isolates in all cases without the need for subcultures.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  == in vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (cftm)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. a  total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across japan during 1996. cftm showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. of the s. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (prsp), with mic values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the mic50 of cftm against prsp was 1.0 microgram/ml. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against  e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. a few strains of e. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. mic values against p. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. the reason for  this discrepancy is unknown. most strains of s. marcescens, c. freundii, and e. cloacae demonstrated resistance to cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, n. gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == ciprofloxacin versus cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial sinusitis.
AB  == objective: this study compared the use and efficacy of ciprofloxacin to cefuroxime axetil for adult patients with acute bacterial sinusitis. method: we conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study of oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) versus cefuroxime axetil (250 mg twice daily)  for 2 to 3 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of  acute bacterial maxillary sinus infections or acute exacerbation of chronic bacterial sinusitis. patients with microbiologically and radiologically confirmed sinusitis infection composed the efficacy population. results: of the 83 patients enrolled, 13 of 42 (31%) ciprofloxacin- and 19 of 41 (46%) cefuroxime axetil-treated patients had a respiratory pathogen isolated from a sinus aspiration. the most frequent pretherapy isolated included haemophilus influenzae (11), streptococcus species (20), staphylococcus species (7), proteus mirabilis (3), and neisseria sicca (3). at the end of therapy, clinical resolution or improvement in efficacy-valid patients was achieved in 12 (100%) ciprofloxacin-treated patients and in 14 (74%) cefuroxime axetil recipients. the  five (26%) cefuroxime axetil clinical failures were due to development of superinfection. bacteriologic eradication occurred in 12 (100%) and 14 (100%) ciprofloxacin and cefuroxime axetil patients, respectively. similar clinical and  bacteriologic response rates were observed at the 2- to 4-week follow-up. among 83 intent-to-treat patients, 19 (45%) ciprofloxacin and 14 (34%) cefuroxime axetil patients had drug-related adverse events. the most common adverse event in both treatment groups was gastrointestinal. conclusion: this pilot study suggests that ciprofloxacin is efficacious in the management of acute bacterial sinusitis.

TI  == bacteraemia in the elderly.
AB  == the aims of the study were to describe community-acquired and nosocomial bacteraemia in elderly patients and to determine the factors associated with increased mortality in these patients attending a tertiary hospital in singapore. a consecutive series of 191 patients aged more than 60 years of age admitted in 1995 was studied retrospectively. all of them had positive blood culture results  obtained from the department of pathology and the case notes were reviewed and entered into a standard clinical protocol. they were analysed for age, sex, place of origin, race, sites of infection, clinical parameters and bacteriology. the mean age of the study population was 75 years (sd = 8.9 years). bacteraemia was acquired from the community in 57.5% of patients, 33% was nosocomial in origin and 9.5% acquired it in chronic long term care facilities. the common organisms cultured in community-acquired infections were escherichia coli (26.1%), klebsiella species (25.4%), streptococcus species (11.1%), methicillin sensitive  staphylococcus aureus (7.6%) and proteus mirabilis (4.8%). the common organisms cultured in nosocomial infections were klebsiella species (19.8%), enterobacter species (14.6%), e. coli (11.8%), acinetobacter baumanii (9.2%), methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus (7.9%) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (7.9%). whilst most cases of bacteraemia were single organism cultures, 13.5% were polymicrobial. the common sources of bacteraemia were chest (27.5%), urinary tract (24.5%), skin (12.5), hepatic (8.8%), gut (4.3%), cardiovascular system (1%) and others (3.6%). in 12.5% of cases, the sources were multiple and in 5.3% of cases, the source could not be identified. twenty-one per cent of patients with bacteraemia died. the following factors were associated with increased mortality rate: older age (median age of those that died was 78.5 years compared to survivors with a median age of 73 years, p = 0.011), patient's place  of origin (patients in nursing home at higher risk of death, p = 0.04), patient's mobility status (immobile patients at higher risk, p = 0.00297), source of bacteraemia--respiratory infection at increased risk of death (p = 0.00009) but urinary tract infection had a better survival rate (p = 0.03935) and multiple sites of infection (patients with multiple sites of infection had higher risk, p  = 0.00897). methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia was associated with a mortality rate of 35.3%, followed by klebsiella species 28.6%,  pseudomonas aeruginosa 28.6%, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus 25%, proteus mirabilis 25% and e. coli 19.1%. important clinical parameters which indicated a poor clinical outcome were: high pulse rate, hypotension, increased respiratory rate, low total white cell count, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia and  increased creatinine level.

TI  == the role of fluoroquinolones in respiratory tract infections.
AB  == quinolones, because of their excellent pharmacokinetic properties, high antimicrobial activity and low incidence of side-effects, have been broadly accepted for the treatment of many infections. because of perceived limitations against streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  there has been some reluctance to use them for respiratory tract infections. ciprofloxacin is the drug of choice for malignant external otitis, a disease caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it has also been used successfully for the  treatment of chronic otitis media where p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and proteus mirabilis are main pathogens. quinolones are as efficacious as the beta-lactams and cephalosporins in the treatment of acute sinusitis but most clinicians will not use quinolones for this indication. acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic  bronchitis respond to antimicrobial therapy and quinolones have been demonstrated to be at least equivalent to second- and third-generation cephalosporins, co-amoxiclav and beta-lactams. recently published guidelines in canada, usa and great britain do not recommend quinolones for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia except for patients with life-threatening disease requiring icu admission. a quinolone in combination with an aminoglycoside and macrolide is a regimen that can be used as initial empirical therapy until the results of microbiological investigations are available. for patients with severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, where multiply resistant aerobic gram-negative bacilli are a consideration, a quinolone in combination with an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin has been recommended. in the absence of p. aeruginosa, monotherapy with a quinolone is at least as effective as third-generation cephalosporins or imipenem. early switch therapy from parenteral antibiotics to oral fluoroquinolone has been demonstrated to be very successful.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == cerebrospinal fluid broth culture isolates: their significance for antibiotic treatment.
AB  == enriched broth medium is routinely used as a supplement for agar plate culture of cerebrospinal fluid (csf). to assess the clinical utility of broth cultures, 151  consecutive csf bacterial and fungal isolates obtained from 91 patients were retrospectively reviewed for the effect of results on treatment. treatment decisions associated with individual csf specimens for which isolates were recovered from thioglycollate broth only were compared with the treatment decisions associated with csf specimens for which isolates were recovered by agar plate culture. treatment was defined as initiation of or change in antimicrobial  therapy based on the reporting of csf culture isolates. thirty-six (24%) of the 151 isolates were recovered in broth only. three (8%) of these 36 isolates (from  34 patients) resulted in treatment with antimicrobial agents; however, 2 of the 3 treated isolates (candida tropicalis, proteus mirabilis) were recovered from a second csf specimen in agar plate culture within 24 hours. thus, only a single isolate (3%; staphylococcus epidermidis) was treated based solely on a positive broth culture result. in contrast, 60 (52%) of the 115 isolates recovered in agar plate culture from 23 (40%) of 57 patients were treated (staphylococci, 28; gram-negative bacilli, 14; cryptococcus neoformans, 10; streptococcus pneumoniae, 3; streptococcus sanguis, 1; other, 4). we conclude that treatment with antimicrobial agents based on isolates recovered from csf specimens in broth culture alone is infrequent and infer from the data that the use of csf broth cultures contributes little to treatment decisions.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humours  of patients by different topical application modes.
AB  == objective: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humour. methods: two hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract extraction received 0.3% ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin or ofloxacin eye drops by two different  administration modes with different frequencies and intervals of application. at  the beginning of cataract extraction (0.5-3 h after the last drop), 50-100 microliters aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber and immediately stored at -80 degrees c. antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: generally, topical ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin yielded aqueous humour levels higher than topical norfloxacin. the  highest concentrations of all tested fluoroquinolones were measured after using an application mode, in which one drop was given every 15 min between 0600 hours  and 0800 hours, prior to operation. when applied by this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.380 (+/- 0.328) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.033-1.388 micrograms.ml-1), norfloxacin 0.182 (0.118) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.038-0.480 microgram.ml-1) and ofloxacin 0.564 (0.372) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.064-1.455 micrograms.ml-1). these mean concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90), concentrations required for inhibition of 90% of pathogen strains in vitro of gram-negative bacteria, such as proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus epidermidis, the pathogen causing eye infections most frequently, were reached by 67.5% of patients after ofloxacin and by 41% after ciprofloxacin, but never after norfloxacin treatment. conclusion: of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humour concentration. this fluoroquinolone may be an useful ophthalmic agent for topical antibacterial  management, but it does not seem to be prophylactically effective against streptococcus pneumoniae or pseudomanas aeruginosa.

AB  == a total of 342 couples planning to undergo in-vitro fertilization (ivf) were examined for the presence of bacteria in semen prior to and during the procedure. pregnancy rates were analysed retrospectively to ascertain any adverse affects if > 10000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml bacteria were detected in the semen sample. the most common bacteria isolated from semen were enterococcus spp. (73%). the presence of these bacteria did not affect the pregnancy rate of the patients with positive cultures prior to (32%) or during (37%) the ivf procedure compared with  those patients in whom no bacteria were detected (32%). those patients with semen cultures positive for escherichia coli prior to the ivf procedure, but which cleared after treatment had a higher pregnancy rate (60%) compared with those patients who were positive for e.coli at the time of the attempt. the group of patients with staphylococcus aureus in the semen at the time of ivf also demonstrated a low pregnancy rate (17%). of the patients. 36 (11%) had positive ureaplasma cultures from the screening test carried out on the semen and 22% became pregnant after successful treatment. none of the three patients with persistently positive cultures became pregnant. in conclusion, the presence of enterococcus in semen does not affect pregnancy rates following ivf. e.coli, s.aureus and ureaplasma urealyticum may have a negative effect and should be treated.

TI  == a study on the nutritive value of pollen from the chinese masson pine (pinus massoniana) and its effect on fecal characteristics in rats.
AB  == a digestion experiment with growing rats was conducted to study the effect of native and broken pollen of chinese masson pine (pinus massoniana) on fecal composition and digestibilities of dry matter, crude protein and crude ash. for that issue each 10 of 30 animals were fed a semisynthetic diet containing either  no pollen or and addition of 6% native or broken pollen for 17 days at restricted amounts. in a second experiment each 6 of 12 growing rats received a semisynthetic diet containing either no or 5% broken pollen. at day 4, 11 and 18  samples of the feces were collected and analyzed for mesophilic aerobic bacteria. the pollen contained large amounts of cell wall constituents (26-30% lignin and 10-15% cellulose, 2-13% hemicellulose) with higher values found in native pollen. the contents of crude protein, crude fat, total lipids, available carbohydrates (starch and sugars), crude ash, gross energy and metabolizable energy were 13%, 2-10%, 8-10%, 17-18%, 3.1-3.5%, 21-22 kj/g and 5.7-9.0 kj/g. the addition of native pollen to the diet increased the total amount of feces by 71% as compared  to the control level. the fecal contents of dry matter and of crude protein and crude ash in fecal dry matter changed by -5, +4 and -5 percentage units. the apparent digestibilites of dry matter and crude protein decreased by 3 and 5 percentage units, respectively, while the apparent digestibility of crude ash remained unchanged. broken pollen acted in the same direction, however the effects were about 20% less pronounced as compared to native pollen. the pollen feeding reduced the fecal germ contents of proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli, while the amounts of alpha-hemolysing streptococci was increased. in total, the observed effects of an addition of native broken or pollen to the diet seemed to be based mainly on the increased intake of cell wall constituents.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

AB  == in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml  was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  == it has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an n-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. in an attempt to find such a precursor, a cdna clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cdna library from porcine bone marrow. in order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we  have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the c-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. we found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of vrrfpwwwpflrr had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. it showed potency against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus group d as well  as aspergillus fumigatus. the action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than  bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mm mgcl2. our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cdna indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.

TI  == a human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB  == it is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (snhl) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. this study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with  acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection  from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. our study revealed the following: (a) suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. of these 20  bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. this staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. this finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing snhl by therapeutic intervention. spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing  loss in addition to the cochlea. this subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) it has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent snhl is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible snhl is caused by serous labyrinthitis. our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) the data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) there were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with  the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. a notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the  rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == bacterial infection and semen characteristics in infertile men.
AB  == semen samples of 190 men attending an andrology clinic were evaluated with bacteriological culture and categorized as negative (group i) and positive (group ii); the effect of bacteriospemia on semen characteristics was also analyzed. semen samples from both groups were simultaneously analyzed for routine parameters such as volume, sperm count, motility, viability and morphology. the semen culture was negative in 34% and positive in 66% of the samples. from 123 samples, 157 aerobes and 8 anaerobes were recovered. the most commonly isolated organism was staphylococchs epidermidis (in 63% of the samples), followed by streptococchs viridans (28%), escherichia coli (9%), staphylococcus aureus (5%),  streptococcus faecalis (5%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (4%), and enterobacter  agglomerans (4%). other microorganisms, including klebsiella sp, candida sp., and proteus mirabilis, were recovered in fewer than 4% of the specimens. the comparison of semen characteristics between infected and noninfected men showed that motile spermatozoa and viability were lower when the microorganisms were present in the semen. it would appear that the bacteria can have a direct effect  on semen quality with negative consequences in fertility.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and mics of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (dmppc)-susceptible staphylococcus aureus subsp.  aureus (mssa), about 80% of dmppc-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 100% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, 95% of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of haemophilus influenzae.  several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc against beta-lactamase producing strains of mssa, m. (b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine and combinations of these compounds].
AB  == using a broth microdilution technique, the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine, and combinations of these compounds was determined. the bacterial strains (n = 88) isolated recently from horses with respiratory symptoms belonged to the following species: streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (n = 34), streptococcus equi subsp. equi (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), rhodococcus equi (n = 4), pseudomonas spp. (n = 3) and escherichia coli (n = 3). in addition, two isolates  of enterobacter spp. and one isolate of streptococcus equisimilis, staphylococcus intermedius, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens were examined. for determination of susceptibility of an organism the following minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were fixed as limiting values: trimethoprim < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, sulfadoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, sulfadimethoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadimethoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml. as expected, rhodococcus-equi-isolates were resistant to the antimicrobials tested. however, most of the clinically more common isolates showed a high degree of susceptibility to the combinations. the fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices indicated synergism of the combination-partners in a wide range. according to these in vitro results, application of trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations for the initial therapy of equine respiratory tract infections can be recommended.

AB  == the aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. the study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). in addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent  of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. the organisms tested  were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups c and g, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of  the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. cefpodoxime  showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral  beta-lactam antibiotics examined. the drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.

TI  == [multicenter evaluation of oral antibiotics: resistance behavior in 5 swiss centers].
AB  == the susceptibility of 2196 fresh clinical isolates to twelve different oral compounds was assessed in five swiss microbiology institutions during summer 1992. a standardized microdilution system including all other material necessary  was employed to assess the antibacterial activity of penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline, erythromycin and clindamycin. the aminopenicillins (including the beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations) were highly active against the streptococci, in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor they covered the majority of the bla+ e. coli and proteus mirabilis and between 60 to 80% of the klebsiella spp. and proteus vulgaris isolates. all the cephalosporins exhibited good activity against the streptococci, they were active against gram-negative fermentative rods to a varying degree. cefetamet was also active against many cefaclor and cefuroxime-resistant isolates. a considerable part of the species studied exhibited resistance to doxycycline; the observed resistance of s. agalactia, p. mirabilis, and morganella morganii agreed with previous findings. most of the streptococcus spp. were inhibited by erythromycin  and clindamycin. there were only single penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in the five swiss centers. taking account of the above particulars the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in switzerland can be considered satisfactory.

TI  == the features and aetiology of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == this paper reports a clinical study of 20 cases of gangrenous ulcers of the scrotum and/or of the penis (fournier's gangrene) and a review of previous publications. even though found mostly in elderly male patients, the disease spares no age group and can involve the external genitalia in neonates and women  as well. the disease is a necrotising fasciitis of infective origin and always has a portal of entry of the infecting organisms even though it may be so trivial as to be undetected. the commonest portals of entry of infection are periurethral sepsis, groin wound sepsis, anorectal sepsis, prostatic sepsis and trauma. the infecting organisms comprise both aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcus. fournier's gangrene is probably the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis occurring in other parts of the body, but modified by the peculiar anatomy of the genitoperineum.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bark extracts of bridelia ferruginea (euphorbiaceae).
AB  == water and ethanol extracts of bridelia ferruginea were examined for phytochemical and antimicrobial properties. the extracts, which were tested at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, produced in vitro antimicrobial activities in assays against hospital strains of staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, streptococcus lactis, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes and klebsiella sp. the zones  of inhibition produced by the extracts in agar diffusion assays against the test  micro-organisms ranged from 4 to 20 mm, while the chloramphenicol antibiotic control produced zones that measured 15-36 mm. preliminary phytochemical analysis of the plant extracts showed the presence of phenols and tannins. sesquiterpenes, anthroquinones, and saponins were not detected in the extracts. the gram-negative bacteria appeared to be more susceptible (4-20 mm) to the antimicrobial effect of the extracts than the gram-positive organisms (4-18 mm).

TI  == bacteremia in a long term care facility.
AB  == episodes of bacteremia identified in a long term care facility over a seven and a half-year period from july 1984 to december 1991 were reviewed. twenty-nine episodes of bacteremia were identified, a rate of 4.35/100,000 patient-days. the  most common infecting organisms were escherichia coli (11 episodes), streptococcus pneumoniae (four), proteus mirabilis (three), staphylococcus aureus (three) and bacteroides species (two). the source of bacteremia was urinary in 45% of patients, gastrointestinal in 17%, pneumonia in 14%, skin in 14% and unknown in 10%. the overall case fatality rate was 24%, but for the final six years of the review the case fatality rate was only 9.5%. these observations report a rate of bacteremia 10-fold lower than reported from other north american long term care facilities and, potentially, a lower case fatality rate. the primary site of bacteremia, however, in long term care facilities is the urinary  tract.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == cefuroxime axetil.
AB  == cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from  the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin c. cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. the majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. these include haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and the  other streptococci (excluding group d streptococci), and moraxella catarrhalis. bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella and shigella and straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). the pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. the absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. the protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. an oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available  as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). cefuroxime axetil  is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic  bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). for most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate.  in some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. if pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. adverse reactions to  cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == the antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during march through april 1985, 1988 and 1992)  to penicillin v, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by mic determination on pdm and pdm ii agar. the mics of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined  against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and bay y 3118. beta-lactamase production was found in  10% of h. influenzae and 80-90% of s. aureus and b. catarrhalis in 1992. among h. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. decreased susceptibility of s. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. decreased susceptibility of s. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. the two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and bay  y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. the study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefdinir (fk482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.

TI  == in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  == in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of  cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal  activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large  bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.

TI  == bronchointerstitial pneumonia and respiratory distress in young horses: clinical, clinicopathologic, radiographic, and pathological findings in 23 cases (1984-1989).
AB  == twenty-three foals, between 1 and 7 months old, with signs of acute respiratory distress, were examined at the veterinary medical teaching hospital (vmth), university of california, davis, between 1984 and 1989. characteristic features included sudden onset of severe respiratory distress and tachypnea, cyanosis unresponsive to nasal oxygen, pyrexia, hypoxemia, hypercapneic respiratory acidosis, poor response to treatment, and histopathologic lesions of bronchiolitis and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. seven of the 23 foals were normal before the onset of respiratory distress, 3 foals were found dead, and 13  foals were being treated for respiratory tract infections at the time of presentation. laboratory data obtained for 13 horses showed increased plasma fibrinogen concentration (630.7 +/- 193 mg/dl), leukocytosis (18,607 +/- 7,784/microl), and neutrophilia (13,737 +/- 8,211/microl). thoracic radiographs showed a diffuse increase in interstitial and bronchointerstitial pulmonary opacity and, in 5 foals, an alveolar pulmonary pattern of increased density was also seen. in 3 foals heavy interstitial infiltration proceeded to a coalescing nodular radiographic appearance. microbiological culture of tracheobronchial aspirates (tba) from 9 foals yielded bacterial growth, but no one bacterial species was consistently isolated. microbiological culture of postmortem specimens of the lung from 6 foals yielded growth of bacteria that included escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, rhodococcus equi, or beta-hemolytic streptococcus spp. tracheobronchial aspirates from 4 foals and lung samples collected from a further 4 foals at necropsy yielded no bacterial growth. cultures were not taken from two foals premortem or  postmortem. virologic examination of tba, lung tissue, or pooled organ tissue from 12 foals was negative. viral culture of tba from 1 foal showed cytopathic effects and positive immunofluorescence for equine herpes virus type ii (ehv-ii). in addition to the 3 foals that were found dead, 11 foals died or were euthanatized. pathologic lesions were limited to the lungs in 50% of the foals; the remainder also had bowel lesions suggestive of hypoxic injury. the predominant histopathologic pulmonary lesions included bronchiolitis, bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, and necrosis. many bronchioles were filled with mucoid and fibrinocellular exudate. the peribronchiolar interstitium and adjacent alveolar spaces were also infiltrated with inflammatory cells and contained proteinaceous edema fluid. type ii cell hyperplasia and hyaline membrane formation were observed in the majority of foals and in 2 foals alveolar multinucleate giant cells were also present.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == in order to examine antibiotic activities of cefteram (cftm), its minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) and those of other cephem drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from july 1990 to june 1991 and from july 1992 to february 1993 from medical facilities throughout the country and against clinically isolated strains detected in our laboratory in samples from patients with various infectious diseases. the obtained results are summarized below. 1. no cftm-resistant strains were found among beta-streptococci, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae or even when found, they were present in extremely low proportions. 2. it appeared that streptococcus pneumoniae insensitive or resistant to beta-lactams, as well as cephems-resistant strains of escherichia coli were increasing. the former included benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae  (pisp) of pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), and the presence of the latter suggests the possibility of the existence of "extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamase" producing strains. the mic's of beta-lactams against the above pisp or prsp, and against cephems-resistant e. coli tended to be high, but those  of cftm were relatively low (in most cases). 3. proportions of strains resistant  to cephems, including cftm among citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and providencia rettgeri were  high, and in addition, the existence of these cephem resistant species suggests an increase in multiple drug resistant strains that show resistance to new quinolone drugs. 4. as mentioned above, cftm is by no means a perfect drug or utility drug and its antimicrobial activities do not cover some recent isolates with multiple drug resistance. except problems encountered with so-called "attenuated" strains of bacteria, increases in resistance can only be observed at a level of mic90's, and as far as mic80's are concerned, cftm still is as active  as before and may be used in the treatment of most infections we encounter in normal medical practices.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for sultamicillin (sbtpc), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated  strains collected from outpatients during a period from august, 1992 to february, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of penicillinase  (pcase)-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 12.0%. mic90 of sbtpc against s. aureus including mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. no increasing tendency was observed for s. aureus resistant to sbtpc. 2. no resistant strains were found among streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (pcs) including sbtpc. but pcs and cephems (ceps) insensitive or resistant streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of s. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. sbtpc showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. however, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of e. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "extended broad-spectrum". mics of sbtpc and ceps against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. the results of the study suggested that the resistant  strains of s. pneumoniae against pcs and ceps might be increasing year by year. some of strains of e. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. it is  important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. it is, however, also confirmed that sbtpc shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. taking into consideration of the strong activities of sbtpc against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, sbtpc may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.

TI  == the management of lateral sinus thrombosis.
AB  == the standard recommended treatment for lateral sinus thrombosis is intravenous antibiotics. for those that fail, some authors recommend anticoagulant therapy, others internal jugular vein ligation. despite these recommendations, there is still a significant mortality in all reported large series and the main reason this is that the cause of the failure has not been found or investigated. over a  six-year-period, from january 1985 to december 1990, 36 patients were admitted with lateral sinus thrombosis. the initial treatment consisted of intravenous antibiotics and surgery. the surgery included cortical mastoidectomy for non-cholesteatomatous ears and modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatomatous ears and drainage of the intracranial collection of pus in patients with subdural empyema and brain abscess. there were nine failures (25 per cent) with this treatment regimen. blood cultures and pus swab of the ears were taken from these patients. the blood cultures were positive in four patients and the organisms isolated included beta-haemolytic streptococcus sp. in two, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pneumoniae in one each. from the ear swab mixed cultures were found in eight and a single organism in one. gram-negative organisms were isolated in nine (100 per cent), proteus mirabilis in eight (89 per cent) and enterobacter sp. in two. both these organisms were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin but were sensitive to amikacin. amikacin was then added to the treatment regimen and a dramatic response with a fall in the temperature,  and improvement in the patients' general condition was noted within 24 hours, in  all patients.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by medline; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by bristol-myers squibb. study selection: only published comparative clinical trial  reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. noncomparative clinical  data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the food and drug administration are not included. data synthesis: data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. in clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be  at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal  adverse effects. conclusions: cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections,  secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.

TI  == multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
AB  == twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam.  high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic  tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst  the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and  co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.

TI  == [a nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in japan (1988-1990)].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout japan from september to december in both 1989 and 1990. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (ipm) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to ipm and aminoglycosides. bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to ipm. ipm had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == loracarbef. a review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy.
AB  == loracarbef is an orally administered member of a new synthetic class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbacephems, which is characterised by enhanced chemical stability. at low concentrations (< 2 mg/l) in vitro, it inhibits streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococci groups b, c and g. proteus mirabilis and moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. at therapeutic plasma concentrations it is also active in vitro against most strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus,  escherichia coli and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of haemophilus influenzae. like other beta-lactams, loracarbef is inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. when administered at dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of loracarbef is comparable with that of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and comparable with that of cefaclor in treating infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures and urinary tract. loracarbef and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v) were equally effective in treating streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis.  loracarbef is generally well tolerated by all age groups and causes less diarrhoea than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. it is administered twice daily. it offers a suitable alternative to other orally administered antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  == spontaneous and experimental infections in scid and scid/beige mice.
AB  == severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice are valuable animals to study a variety of physiologic and disease processes. their capacity to support multiple  tissue xenografts permits these mice to be used as intermediate models for host-specific, fastidious organisms for which a small animal model has not been available previously. however, because they are unable to mount a normal immune response, they are very susceptible to a variety of primary and opportunistic microbial pathogens. fatal, naturally occurring infections with bacteria such as  proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans, and escherichia coli have been observed. in addition, based on observations after experimental or naturally occurring viral infections, scid and scid/beige mice have been shown to be very susceptible to infections with viruses such as mouse hepatitis virus, sendai virus, and murine respiratory virus, with resulting mortality. of the parasitic infections, pneumocystis carinii is a relatively common contaminant of the respiratory tracts of scid mice and may complicate research projects, particularly experimental respiratory tract infections. in view of the enhanced susceptibility of these mice to infections of this type, it is essential that they be housed under optimal conditions, which include implementing stringent management practices and a functional barrier system.

TI  == efficacy of fleroxacin versus amoxicillin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == in a multicenter study the efficacy and safety of oral fleroxacin at 400 mg once  a day and amoxicillin at 500 mg three times daily for 7 days were compared for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to drug-susceptible bacteria. a total of 194 patients were enrolled, 102 in the fleroxacin group and 92 in the amoxicillin group. of those enrolled, 22 in the fleroxacin group and 30 (29 for clinical efficacy) in the amoxicillin group were included in the efficacy analysis. all were included in the safety analysis. clinical success was noted in 21 (95%) of 22 fleroxacin-treated patients and 22 (76%) of 29 amoxicillin-treated patients. bacteriologic cure was obtained in 21 (95%) of 22 of the fleroxacin group and 18  (60%) of 30 of the amoxicillin group. one haemophilus parainfluenzae strain persisted with fleroxacin. persisting organisms with amoxicillin included haemophilus influenzae (four), haemophilus parainfluenzae (three), escherichia coli (two), streptococcus pneumoniae (one), neisseria species (one), and proteus  mirabilis (one). adverse events were reported by 41% of 102 patients receiving fleroxacin and 15% of 92 patients receiving amoxicillin. insomnia, dizziness, and nausea occurred more frequently with fleroxacin. fleroxacin may be indicated for  the treatment of acute bacterial infection in chronic bronchitis known to be due  to haemophilus species and moraxella catarrhalis. the 92% incidence of resistance among the s. pneumoniae isolates recovered from all enrolled patients suggests that fleroxacin may not be useful for such infections.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

AB  == loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. a review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values (microgram/ml) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; m. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; h. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; escherichia coli, 2.0-25; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; s. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. the in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the results of in vitro susceptibility tests with  any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. this is particularly true with h. influenzae. furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.

TI  == parameters characterizing the in vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral broad spectrum cephalosporin, against respiratory and urinary pathogens.
AB  == the wide and potent in vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral broad spectrum cephalosporin, has been confirmed on a collection of respiratory and urinary pathogens recently isolated in italy. the new cephem emerged as the most bactericidal of all the comparators tested against several fast as well as slowly-growing gram-negative species including enterobacteria, haemophilus and moraxella, irrespective of their ability to synthetize beta-lactamases. among the gram-positive species streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were effectively covered. cefixime activity was not adversely influenced by several important variables such as ph (over the range from 5 to 8), inoculum size (from 10(5) to 10(8) cfu per ml) and the presence of 50% human serum or urine. time-kill tests confirmed a pronounced bactericidal potency of the drug especially towards common respiratory pathogens (h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes). killing of urinary strains was optimal at cefixime concentrations reached in urine since eradication, except for proteus mirabilis, was enhanced with increasing levels of the drug. the absence of an untoward paradoxic effect on the rate of cefixime bactericidal action was confirmed by employing a dynamic  bladder model simulating the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug after a single 200 mg daily dosage. interactions of cefixime with several other drugs that may be employed in combination therapy were generally prone to provide indifference and synergism while antagonism was never observed. favorable interactions were also registered when cefixime acted with other antibiotics on partially resistant species such as staphylococci and pseudomonas. the new cephem seems to provide excellent opportunities for expanding oral cephalosporin therapy to a wide range of infections produced by susceptible pathogens in the adult and  pediatric populations.

AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

TI  == long-acting chloramphenicol versus intravenous ampicillin for treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == in most developing countries, bacterial meningitis (bm) is associated with a high case-fatality rate. the search for a simple, convenient, and inexpensive antibiotic treatment remains a priority. in this study, a non-blinded, multicentre, randomised clinical trial of 528 cases of bm was done in two hospitals in mali and niger, between march, 1989, and may, 1990, to see whether a double injection of long-acting chloramphenicol (on admission to hospital and 48  h later) is as effective as a course of intravenous ampicillin (8 days, 4 times a day). the cumulative case-fatality rate on day 4 (principal end-point) among the  chloramphenicol (254 patients) and ampicillin (274) groups were, respectively, 28% and 24.5% (relative risk 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.52). no outbreak occurred during the study period. the hospital case-fatality rate was 33.1%. main risk factors for death were associated with clinical condition on admission--ie, altered consciousness, convulsions, or dehydration. the case-fatality rates were 13% (21/161) for neisseria meningitidis, 36.1% (48/133)  for haemophilus influenzae, and 67% (77/115) for streptococcus pneumoniae. in a multiple logistic regression model, controlling for the differential distribution of potential risk factors (including bacterial species), there was no difference  between treatment groups. our findings suggest that long-acting chloramphenicol is a useful first-line presumptive treatment for bm in high-incidence countries.

AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), klebsiella spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., and salmonella spp.  this antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter spp., and morganella morganii. cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group a, b, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 less than 0.015 mg/l). the mics of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with mics below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteriology of community acquired urinary tract infection. analysis of 1048 cases.
AB  == urine samples from 1048 cases clinically suspected to have urinary tract infection were examined for bacteriological culture and antibiotic sensitivity. of 1048 cultures, 530 (50.5%) were sterile, 163 (15.5%) showed the presence of nonpathogenic bacteria and 11 (1%) revealed nonsignificant bacteriuria with escherichia coli. significant bacteriuria (more than 10(5)/ml) was found in the remaining 344 (32.8%) cases. escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen isolated from 170 (16.2%) samples; klebsiella aerogenes was the next in order, found in 46 (4.3%) cases. streptococcus pyogenes was isolated in 37 (3.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa in 29 (2.7%), proteus mirabilis in 26 (2.4%), streptococcus faecalis in 21 (2.0%), staphylococcus aureus in 12 (1%) and citrobacter freundii in 3 cases. nalidixic acid was the most effective drug against gram negative organisms. nitrofurantoin was the next antibiotic of choice, whereas cephalexin was the third drug in order of sensitivity. ampicillin was the first drug of choice in infection with gram positive cocci, followed by nitrofurantoin, tetracycline, cephalexin and cephaloridine. the results of sensitivity tests emphasise the problem of multiple drug resistance in our community.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, e-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. ro 09-1428 inhibited  group a streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group b, c  and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for staphylococcus aureus ro 09-1428 had mics of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and e-1040. against pseudomonas aeruginosa ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml,  and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, providencia, salmonella and shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. for most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae  ro 09-1428 had higher mics of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. anaerobes, enterococci and listeria monocytogenes were resistant to ro 09-1428. ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-2, staphylococcus aureus pc-1, moraxella catarrhalis bro-1, enterobacter p-99, pseudomonas aeruginosa sabath-abraham or klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-7 and tem-9. ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid ph.

TI  == use of gas liquid chromatography as an adjunct to conventional bacteriological methods in the diagnosis of anaerobic cerebral abscess.
AB  == forty cases of cerebral abscesses were studied prospectively to establish the microbial agents implicated in these cases. chronic otitis media (14 patients, 35%), congenital heart disease (five patients, 12.5%),a and meningitis (five patients, 12.5%) were among the important predisposing factors. streptococcus (14 patients, 35%) was the most common causative pre-isolated, the predominant species being streptococcus milleri (11 patients, 27.5%). other organisms isolated included proteus mirabilis in six patients (15%) and staphylococcus aureus in five patients (12.5%). anaerobes (12 patients, 30%), predominantly bacteroides sp. (eight patients, 20%), played an important role in these cases, the majority of which were isolated in mixed cultures. gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of pus detected the presence of anaerobes in another 11 cases of cerebral abscess, in which cultures of anaerobes were negative. therefore, gas-liquid chromotography is useful as an adjunct to conventional bacteriological methods in providing a rapid and sensitive means of detecting anaerobes in pus obtained especially from patients who had received antibiotic therapy prior to hospitalization.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against bacterial isolates obtained from patients with cancer.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime, an oral cephalosporin ester, against 792 bacterial isolates representing 36 species was evaluated in comparison to that of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx). cefpodoxime inhibited  the majority of streptococcus spp., haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis  at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. it was also active against citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus isolates. overall, cefpodoxime appeared to be less active than ciprofloxacin and  tmp/smx against many pathogens common in cancer patients.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of ceftibuten (cbt) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,416 bacterial strains isolated in 5 hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae, mic 50 and 90% were respectively (micrograms/ml): (i) naturally non beta-lactamase producing species: e. coli 0.12-0.5, shigella 0.06-0.12 and salmonella 0.03-0.12, p. mirabilis 0.16-0.03. (ii) chromosomal penicillinase producing species: k. pneumoniae 0.03-0.5 and k. oxytoca 0.03-0.06. (iii) chromosomal cephalosporin producing species: e. cloacae and c. freundii 1-  greater than 128: s. marcescens 0.25-2; indole + proteus 0.06-0.12. activity of cbt was not modified on plasmid mediated penicillinase producing strains; however, cbt was inactive on cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains, and its activity was variably reduced on broad spectrum beta-lactamases producing strains. cbt was inactive on p. aeruginosa (mic greater than or equal to 32) and  on a. baumannii (8- greater than 128). haemophilus and gonococci, regardless on beta-lactamase production status, were very susceptible to cbt (mic 50 and 90%: 0.06-0.5 and 0.016-0.06); it is the same situation for meningococci; b. catarrhalis was generally inhibited by 0.03 to 2 (strains susceptible to penicillin g) and 0.12 to 16 (strains resistant to penicillin g). cbt was inactive on staphylococci. enterococci and streptococci b were generally resistant; streptococci a, c, g were inhibited by low concentrations: 0.06 to 1 (mic 50 and 90%: 0.25-0.5), whereas mic for other streptococci 0.12 to 128 (mic 50 and 90%: 8-128) and for pneumococci were 0.25 to 16 (4-8). these antibacterial properties particularly against enterobacteriaceae placed cbt in excellent position among oral cephalosporins.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluation of ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  == ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were  inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime  against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of gr69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  == gr69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (mic90). it had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and e-1040. against cephalosporinase-producing enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens, mics ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and  cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to gr69153, and for this organism the mic90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the e-1040 mic90, but most pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. gr69153 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. for staphylococcus aureus gr69153 mics were similar to those of ceftazidime and e-1040. enterococci and listeriae were resistant to gr69153, but streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. the activity of gr69153 was not affected by serum. gr69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, and bro-1, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-9, and morganellae. gr69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. it is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. gr69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.

TI  == comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  == thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (uti) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower uti) or a 14 day (upper uti) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper uti. overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. the infecting organisms were: escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), citrobacter freundii (three), klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter agglomerans, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis (one of each). all of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. the effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. the cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively.  there were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. in the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. one of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. in this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic uti.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil in a pharmacokinetic in-vitro model.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil was studied in an in-vitro model simulating doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg. strains of klebsiella spp. proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, and haemophilus influenzae were effectively reduced by a dose of 200 mg. while for esch. coli no dose-activity relationship was observed--the maximal effect was achieved with a simulated dose of 100 mg--staphylococcus aureus could be reduced effectively only by a simulated dose of 400 mg. the lower doses showed stepwise lower activities.  apart from broad spectrum beta-lactamases like shv 2 or tem 5 the presence of plasmid coded beta-lactamases in esch. coli and h. influenzae did not affect the  antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil. the results show that cefpodoxime was more active against gram-negative bacteria than amoxycillin, and comparable activity to intramuscular cefotiam in the in-vitro model.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of ru 51746 (sodium salt of cefpodoxime). results of a multicenter study].
AB  == cefpodoxime proxetil, a new oral cephalosporin, is the prodrug ester of cefpodoxime. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of ru 51746 (sodium salt of  cefpodoxime: cpd) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1 696 bacterial strains isolated in 5 hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae, mic 50 and 90% were respectively (micrograms/ml): (1) naturally non betalactamase producing species: e. coli, shigella and salmonella 0.25-0.5; p. mirabilis 0.06-0.12. (ii) chromosomal penicillinase producing species: klebsiella 0.12-1. (iii) chromosomal cephalosporinase producing species: e. cloacae and c. freundii 2-greater than 128; s. marcescens 2-64; indole + proteus 0.25-64; p. stuartii 0.25-16. activity  of cpd was not modified on plasmid mediated penicillinase producing strains, but  cpd was inactive on cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains, and on broad spectrum betalactamases producing strains. cpd was inactive on p. aeruginosa (mic greater than or equal to 64) and on a. baumannii (16-pi 128). haemophilus, regardless on betalactamase production status, were very susceptible to cpd (mic  less than or equal to 0.25) and b. catarrhalis was generally inhibited by 0.12 to 1. cpd was poorly active on methicillin susceptible staphylococci (mic 50 and 90%: 2-4) and inactive on methicillin resistant strains. enterococci and listeria monocytogenes were generally resistant; streptococci a, b, c, g and pneumococci were inhibited by low concentration: 0.002 to 0.25 (mic 50 and 90%: 0.016-0.032)  whereas mic for other streptococci were 0.004 to 32 (mic 50 and 90%: 0.25-4). these antibacterial properties placed cpd in excellent position among oral cephalosporins.

TI  == ampicillin/sulbactam versus clindamycin in the treatment of postpartum endomyometritis.
AB  == sixty-eight patients with postpartum endomyometritis were enrolled in this open randomized comparative study. forty-two patients received ampicillin/sulbactam and 26 received clindamycin. the cure rates were similar in the two groups: 83% in the ampicillin/sulbactam group and 88% in the clindamycin group. the most frequent endometrial bacterial isolates were bacteroides bivius, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and ureaplasma urealyticum. bacteremia was present in 15 of 68 (22%), the most frequent isolates being mycoplasma (four cases) and b bivius (three cases). clindamycin-resistant species were s faecalis, e coli, and  proteus mirabilis. there were seven treatment failures in the ampicillin/sulbactam group; only one isolate (an e coli) was resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam. in a significant number of these failures, mycoplasma was isolated. ampicillin/sulbactam and clindamycin were found to be equally efficacious in the treatment of postpartum endometritis.

TI  == the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in st  thomas' hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  == we have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. among the gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. the enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to  the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. we have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. although  many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.

TI  == recurrent postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  == we treated five patients for postoperative endophthalmitis who demonstrated an initially good response to intravitreal management of their infection and then suffered a later recurrence. four of the five patients received a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics as the only intravitreal therapy, and the fifth patient received a single antibiotic injection in addition to a partial vitrectomy. all recurrent infections occurred between 10 and 21 days after the original intravitreal injection of antibiotics. at the time of the recurrence, all five patients remained culture positive with the same organism that was initially isolated. the bacterial species isolated were s. epidermidis, group d streptococcus, p. acnes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa. all patients were ultimately sterilized with repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, vitrectomy, and/or intraocular lens removal. factors that were related to recurrent infection were marginal susceptibility of the organism to the originally injected antibiotics, infection with a slowly replicating organism, and infection with a gram-negative bacillus. a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. patients should be observed for at least 3 weeks following treatment of endophthalmitis for recurrence of their infection, and aggressive management, including vitrectomy and repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, should be used to treat recurrent infections.

AB  == for the first time, co(ii), ni(ii) and zn(ii) complexes have been synthesized involving an intermediate schiff base, indane-1,3-dione-2-imine-n-acetic acid the condensed product of ninhydrin and glycine. these coloured complexes were characterised by elemental analysis, molar conductivity, thermogravimetric analyses/differential thermal analysis, infrared, magnetic susceptibility, nmr and electronic spectral studies. mechanisms for their formation have been proposed. the experimental studies reveal that the complexes possess octahedral stereochemistry whereas the schiff base behaves as a monobasic tridentate ligand. a molecular structure for the metal complexes is also proposed. a comparative study of the antimicrobial activity of ninhydrin and the corresponding metal complexes against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus and  streptococcus faecalis has been undertaken and the results are discussed.

AB  == fk482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a c-3 vinyl group. its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime,  and amoxicillin-clavulanate. fk482 inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012  micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. it  did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. fk482 inhibited 90% of enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. although 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, and shigella  species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, fk482 was less active than cefixime against citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella, serratia, and providencia species, with mics for many isolates of greater than 8  micrograms/ml. fk482 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. bacteroides and pseudomonas species were resistant. fk482 was not hydrolyzed by the tem-1 and tem-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the proteus vulgaris enzyme. it had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.

(xanthomonas) maltophilia localized to the subcutaneous neck tissue of guinea pigs was also treated successfully. lung infections caused by ps. aeruginosa in guinea pigs were treated effectively by meropenem, imipenem, and ceftazidime at the dose of 10 mg/kg but only meropenem eradicated bacteria from all the tissues examined. these results demonstrate that meropenem has excellent antibacterial activity in vivo in both normal and immunocompromised animals and in some models of infection is superior to imipenem.

AB  == the potential for cervicovaginal contamination has precluded direct sampling of the endometrial cavity and has led to the development of multi-lumen protected catheter systems, among other techniques. the extent of this presumed contamination was examined using three different techniques in 55 postpartum women with the diagnosis of endometritis. each woman had the endometrium sampled  with an unprotected cotton-tipped swab, a double-lumen catheter with brush, and a flexible endometrial suction curette. a statistically larger number of bacterial  species was recovered with the cotton swab (2.4) than with the double-lumen catheter (1.3) or the suction curette (1.7) (p less than .001). a difference was  also noted between the double-lumen catheter and the suction curette (p = .006);  however, this represented less than one-third of a single bacterial species. the  larger number of bacterial species recovered by the unprotected methods was found to result not from cervicovaginal contamination, as suspected, but from a significant increase in the recovery of bacteria commonly regarded as potential pathogens, such as bacteroides bivius, streptococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, and bacteroides melaninogenicus.

AB  == cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807) is a new oral cephem derivative drug in which carboxylic acid was esterified to the 4-position of cpdx (oxime type cephem antibiotic). cpdx-pr is hydrolyzed mainly with esterase in intestinal wall and cpdx exists as an active form in body fluid. while there are numerous study reports using cpdx-pr in tablet forms in japan, the dry syrup formula for pediatric use was newly developed. the dry syrup of cpdx-pr was orally administered 20 minutes after meal to the 6 boys of ages from 8 years and 1 month to 10 years and 10 months, with doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, for 3 cases each. serum concentrations and urinary concentrations and recovery rate of the drug were investigated. in addition to the above, the clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 105 cases consisting of children with ages ranging from 2 months to 11 years and 8 months, upon administering an average dose of 3.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times per day (96 cases of 3 times and 9 cases of 4 times). the 105 cases included 13 cases of pharyngitis, 21 cases of tonsillitis, 4 cases of acute bronchitis, 6 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of pleurisy, 13 cases of scarlet fever, 41 cases of urinary tract infection, 3 cases of posthitis and 3 cases of bacillary dysentery. drug sensitivity test was  performed for the following strains: (i) strains retained by our department; 52 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 18 strains of streptococcus agalactiae, and 11 strains of bordetella pertussis, and (ii) strains isolated from cases to which cpdx-pr was administered; 2 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 8 strains of s. pyogenes, 2 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 10 strains of escherichia coli, and 1 strain of proteus mirabilis. drug sensitivities of the strains retained by  our department were tested with the inoculum sizes of 10(8) and 10(6) cfu/ml for  r-3746 (na-salt of cpdx), cefaclor (ccl), cephalexin (cex), amoxicillin (ampc), and methicillin (dmppc), and those against strains separated from the cases to which cpdx-pr was administered were tested with the same inoculum sizes for r-3746, ccl, cex, cefadroxil, ampicillin (abpc), dmppc and cloxacillin (mcipc). adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  == bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807), a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. antibacterial activities of r-3746 (na-salt of cefpodoxime (cpdx] against clinically isolated strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were compared with those of cefaclor, cephalexin and cefadroxil. r-3746 is superior to other antibiotics against s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. catarrhalis and gram-negative rods. 2. serum concentrations of cpdx after administration of cpdx-pr at doses of 3 mg/kg (fasting), 6 mg/kg (non-fasting) and 6 mg/kg (fasting) were determined. mean auc  (area under curve)'s of cpdx obtained were 9.60, 31.35 and 17.89 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively for the 3 dosages. the mean half-lives of cpdx were 3.35, 1.88 and 1.76 hours, respectively. the mean urinary recovery rate within 8 hours after administration of cpdx-pr at a dose of 3 mg/kg (fasting) was 39.2%. 3. cpdx-pr was administered to 37 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pyelonephritis 9, cystitis 4, pneumonia 7, acute bronchitis 3, otitis media 2, tonsillitis 10, subcutaneous abscess 1 and purulent lymphadenitis 1). the overall clinical efficacy rate was 91.9% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was also 91.9%. 4. no adverse reactions were observed. abnormal laboratory findings were moderate, eosinophilia in 2 and slight elevation of got and gpt in 1. the taste and the odor of the cpdx-pr preparation was sufficiently tolerable. from the above results we have concluded  that cpdx-pr is a useful oral antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == comparative activity of cefixime and cefaclor in an in vitro model simulating human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == the dependence of the antibacterial activity of the two oral cephalosporins cefixime and cefaclor on pharmacokinetic properties was investigated in an in vitro model using strains of enterobacteria and a streptococcal strain. in the cultures the course of serum concentrations of the respective antibiotic was simulated. the more rapidly attained (1 h) high peak levels (17.5 micrograms/ml)  of cefaclor (500 mg dose) in no case showed an advantage over the more slowly reached (3 h) low peak levels (2.5 micrograms/ml) of cefixime (200 mg dose). cefixime was comparable to cefaclor with respect to its initial killing velocity, whereas it was generally superior with respect to maximum values for reduction of bacterial counts. due to its long elimination half-life (2.5 h) cefixime prevented regrowth for at least twice as long as cefaclor, which has a short half-life (0.7 h). as a result of its antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic  properties cefixime can be administered less frequently than cefaclor.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of lomefloxacin activity in colombia.
AB  == as part of the worldwide in vitro program to determine the antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, our study tested susceptibility of bacterial isolates from hospitals in medellin, colombia. a total of 504 bacterial isolates were obtained  from patients at three different centers. for enterobacteriaceae, 0.5 micrograms/ml inhibited 100% of the indole-positive proteus and salmonella spp.;  1 microgram/ml inhibited 100% of shigella and citrobacter, 2 microgram/ml inhibited 100% of enterobacter spp., e. coli, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates tested. the mic90 for klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas spp. was 4 micrograms/ml. the mic90 was 4 micrograms/ml for s. aureus and 2 micrograms/ml for s. epidermidis and s. saprophyticus. the mic90 of streptococcus spp. were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml for all isolates tested. considering that 97.8% were susceptible to concentrations of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of lomefloxacin, this new quinolone offers potential in the therapy of a variety of systemic infections, especially in patients with multiply resistant pathogens.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
AB  == antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (cftm) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. antibacterial  activities of cftm against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (ccl). 2. activities of cefixime (cfix) were superior to those of cftm against b. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to cftm against s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus. 3. activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of  ccl against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and s. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to cftm and cfix against most of gram-negative rods. 4. sultamicillin (sbtpc) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its mics did not exceed the mics of ampicillin by itself. sbtpc showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == root canal microflora: qualitative changes after endodontic instrumentation.
AB  == the changes in the pattern of bacteria in root canal after repeated washing with  naocl and endodontic instrumentation were evaluated. samples were obtained from the root canals of patients before and after endodontic instrumentation, and analyzed according to the usual microbiological techniques. washing with naocl and endodontic instrumentation act against bacteria such as peptostreptococci, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, proteus mirabilis, bacteroides, whereas streptococcus lactis and aerococcus were present before and after endodontic instrumentation. environmental conditions such as low ph could be responsible for the persistence of gram-positive bacteria. the use of topical treatment and the associated endodontic instrumentation seem useful in the eradication of some bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

AB  == in vitro activities of cefuzonam (czon) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mic's and the results of disc susceptibility test. the mic's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)cfu/ml. the mic80's of czon against streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae and citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. the mic80's against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. the mic80's against staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. approximately 70% of strains of s. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. for the interpretation of the czon showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa disc containing czon, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic less than 60 micrograms/ml. reliability of the czon  disc tests in estimating approximate mic values was studied using showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms czon. a good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters  and mic's, showing the reliability of the disc method. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately  classified into the 4 groups except those against p. aeruginosa. some strains of  p. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with mic's against these organisms. as czon is not effective against p. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between mic's and the disc test would result when p. aeruginosa was excluded. with showa  30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. in this study, however, it was  demonstrated that differentiation of strains with mic's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of czon were used. according to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including  penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding  of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in  the body.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == production of a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance by genital flora bacteria.
AB  == bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter  calcoaceticus, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (amniostat-flm). all species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. the material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. the possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  == ciprofloxacin activity in cyst fluid from polycystic kidneys.
AB  == renal cyst infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease (pkd) is often unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy, in part because of the failure of most antibiotics to adequately penetrate cyst fluid. ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. to study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. the ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. the mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis.

TI  == a survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  == ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. the efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the united states. data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. the unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. the  duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections  (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. in 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. after treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. of 411 isolates of p. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 escherichia coli and 80% of 248 staphylococcus aureus isolates. also eradicated were 95% of 166 klebsiella, 96% of 139 proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other proteus, 94% of 123 enterobacter, 100% of 68 haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 citrobacter, 89% of 45 serratia, 95% of 41 streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 salmonella, 100% of 38 morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 providencia isolates. adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. the most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated sgot, sgpt, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). crystalluria,  judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == we used the commercially available multitest (r) cmi to assess the response of 100 adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia to the following seven  antigens: tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, streptococcus, proteus, tuberculin,  candida, and trichophyton. thirty-one of the patients responded to one or more of these antigens and survived their acute illness. of the multitest (r) cmi negative patients, 49 lived and 20 died. a comparison of the three groups revealed that the 31 patients with positive tests were significantly younger and  had a higher mean serum albumin than did those with negative tests who died. multivariate analysis revealed that a positive multitest (r) cmi and the albumin  level were independent predictors of survival. a positive multitest (r) cmi identified a less seriously ill group of patients as evidenced by 100% survival,  by a very low rate of complications (0.18/patient), and by less utilization of resources (fewer hemograms and chest radiographs). thus a positive multitest (r)  cmi may identify patients who could be discharged earlier, and a negative test should target its patients for more aggressive therapy.

TI  == bmy-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

TI  == a shift from acute to chronic spontaneous pyelonephritis in male mm mice associated with a change in the causal micro-organisms.
AB  == proteus mirabilis was the predominant cause of acute diabetes-associated pyelonephritis occurring spontaneously in male mm mice until they were segregated in a new environment. thereafter pasteurella pneumotropica and streptococcus faecalis emerged collectively as the most common causal organisms, the pyelonephritis became more chronic and proteus mirabilis isolates from faeces and urine produced atypical non-swarming colonies on blood agar plates. this did not  account for the reduced pathogenicity of proteus mirabilis; when mm males were returned to the original environment the pyelonephritis again became acute but was associated with the atypical type of proteus mirabilis although the normal type was abundant in the environment. the mm mice were caesarean-derived and cross-fostered shortly before their transfer to the second environment, which probably accounts for their changed microbial status, but the reason for the emergence of the atypical type of proteus mirabilis is not understood. the acute  nature of the male mm pyelonephritis when caused by proteus mirabilis parallels the situation described in other animals and humans.

TI  == trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst fluid from autosomal dominant polycystic kidneys.
AB  == cyst infection in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd) is often refractory to therapy, in part because of the limited entry of commonly used antibiotics into cyst fluid. to study the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst infection, cyst fluid was obtained by percutaneous aspiration or at surgery from eight patients with adpkd receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient  by cyst-fluid sodium concentration. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole concentrations  within cysts were determined and cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers were assessed in vitro against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus fecalis. the mean cyst fluid trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole concentrations were 15.2 micrograms/ml and 42.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. preferential accumulation of trimethoprim was observed in gradient cysts, exceeding serum levels more than eightfold. sulfamethoxazole penetrated cysts to  a lesser extent, with concentrations ranging from 10 to 70 percent of the serum level. cyst fluid sampled prior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administration (control) demonstrated no antibacterial activity, while cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers following antibiotic administration were 1:32 or greater in most instances. these studies indicate that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is likely to be efficacious in the treatment of cyst infection in polycystic kidneys.

AB  == the post-antibiotic suppressive effect (pae) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a pae against gram-negative bacteria. in this study, the paes of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus faecalis were determined. the differences in pae determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for s. aureus and e. coli. ciprofloxacin had a pae by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. a ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in mueller-hinton broth, ph 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a pae of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for s. aureus, but had no effect on s. faecalis. exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour pae for e. coli, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae. use of mueller-hinton broth with a  magnesium concentration of 8 mm, ph 5.5, yielded similar results. using human serum, a four-hour pae was found for p. aeruginosa. there was a progressive increase in the pae as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from  0.9 hours to three hours. increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to  eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for p. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the mbc for e. coli did not cause a significant difference  in the pae using a two-hour exposure. overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent pae for most gram-negative bacteria and for s. aureus, but not for s. faecalis. a pae caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the ph adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. these results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment  of tissue and urinary infections.

TI  == [recent trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in japan (1979-1984). part 4. a classification of prognosis and antibiotic treatment based on causative agents].
AB  == nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. the number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (ags) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-ags antibiotics including beta-lactam (non ags) was observed. a trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (cfr) was  observed except that cfr for gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + ags remained at a same level. cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. cases with staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, cfr was 28.6%  (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + ags and 37.5% (3/8) with  beta-lactam + non ags (p less than 0.1). among 100 cases of group b streptococcus (gbs), cfr was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + ags (p less than 0.1). among 198 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae, cfr was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. cfr for the cases treated with beta-lactam + ags was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + non ags was 3.6% (1/28) (p less than 0.1). cfr for 292 cases of haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + ags and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam  + non ags, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. among 111 cases of escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + non ags gave 6.5% (2/31) cfr, and 5.6% (1/18) cfr, respectively, whereas beta-lactam  + ags showed cfr of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (p less than 0.1). similar tendencies were observed in the cases of listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. contrary to the high cfr observed with the beta-lactam + ags treatment, significantly low cfr was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. infections with gbs, e. coli, and p. mirabilis  occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and cfr was especially high in  the very young.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == lectins for the identification of ocular bacterial pathogens.
AB  == in a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, strep. pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, hemophilus influenzae, and proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. all clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. the gram-positive  isolates bound concanavalin a, while the gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. streptococcal species isolates reacted with dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. lectins may be useful  in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == pefloxacin was evaluated in the treatment of bone infections. a clinical trial was performed in 15 patients with chronic osteitis (5 staphylococcus aureus, 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 serratia sp., 1 proteus mirabilis, and a mixed infection with a streptococcus faecalis and escherichia coli). patients were given pefloxacin 400 mg 12-hourly iv for 48 h followed by oral treatment. bone biopsies from the iliac crest were carried out after at least seven days treatment, 2 h after the last dose. serum levels were estimated at the same time. in 13 patients the pefloxacin levels were between 2 and 10 mg per g of bone and always greater than, or equal to, the mic for the infecting organism. in 11 patients treated for six months and followed up for up to 14 months after the completion of treatment, the therapy was successful. in another two patients, the results were excellent with closure of fistulae, but there was only limited follow-up. there were two failures: in one (post-radiation osteitis) the infection persisted and in the other there was intolerance of the antimicrobial.  in both cases there was no increase in the mic of pefloxacin against the organisms. three patients underwent operations for orthopaedic indications, after at least two months of treatment. bone cultures from the initial focus remained sterile. side-effects were mild.

TI  == escherichia coli adherence to anion exchange resin. in vitro model for initial screening of potential antiadherence agents.
AB  == the first step in developing a bladder infection is attachment of bacteria to the bladder epithelium. removing the bladder mucin increases bacterial adherence up to a thousand-fold, and this increase can be prevented by pretreating the mucin-deficient bladder with heparin. to develop a rapid, in vitro antiadherence  screening assay, we studied the adherence of escherichia coli to various chromatography resins and the ability of heparin and other agents to antagonize this attachment. the results can be summarized as follows: although e. coli attached to all resins, only the adherence to the anion exchange resin was inhibited by heparin (up to 95%). agents which did not effect e. coli adherence to the resin did not affect attachment to the bladder. agents which inhibited e.  coli adherence to the bladder also inhibited e. coli adherence to the resin. similar to the effect of heparin on e. coli attachment, the adherence of klebsiella ozaene, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus fecalis to both bladder epithelium and anion exchange resin were also antagonized. these studies indicate that the adherence of e. coli (as well as other bacterial species) to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a similar manner  as does adherence to the mucin-deficient rabbit urinary bladder. because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.

AB  == two thousand five hundred and sixty-eight positive monomicrobic urine samples (from general practice and hospital wards) were examined and isolated strains were tested against various antimicrobial drugs. our findings showed that urinary-tract infections caused by escherichia coli were the most common in females, whereas those by pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter  species, other difficult gram-negative rods and streptococcus faecalis were in total the most common in males. if we compare the strains isolated from general practice with those from the hospital, no significant differences were observed.  e. coli strains were the most susceptible to the tested drugs; cefotaxime, amikacin, cefuroxime and ceftazidime were the most effective drugs against enterobacter species, ps. aeruginosa, p. rettgeri and proteus mirabilis. p. mirabilis and str. faecalis strains isolated in the hospital were more chemo-resistant than those isolated in general practice. ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole were less active against e. coli strains isolated  from children's departments in comparison with the others.

TI  == bacterial colonization of hemasite access devices.
AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

AB  == a-56619 and a-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae. a-56619 and a-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. infection with salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with a-56619 (50% effective dose [ed50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ed50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). e. coli or pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with a-56619 or a-56620 than with norfloxacin. after oral treatment, the  ed50s of a-56619 and a-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against e. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against e. coli or p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. a-56619 and a-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by e. coli and streptococcus faecalis. a-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and a-56620  was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against klebsiella pneumonia in mice. a-56619 and a-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. a-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas a-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. the peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of a-56619 and a-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. the serum hal-lives of a-56619 and a-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.

TI  == current state and tendencies of antibiotic resistance in hungary.
AB  == this survey is based on data for 245 903 isolates reported by public health network laboratories in 1983. facultatively pathogenic gram-negative bacteria comprised two-third of the isolates, and--except escherichia coli--were resistant in a high percent to the most frequently used antibiotics. oxacillin and vancomycin were the most effective against staphylococcus aureus being in 94.7% resistant to penicillin. in contrast to other streptococci, all streptococcus pyogenes strains were sensitive to penicillin. the majority of the gram-positive  strains were resistant to tetracycline. a comparison to results reported earlier  (1974 to 1983) showed an increasing resistance rate mainly to ampicillin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, which were introduced in therapy during this period. resistance rate of almost all species has increased to gentamicin, e.g. that of proteus mirabilis has risen tenfold. emergence of haemophilus influenzae resistant to ampicillin, and increasing resistance rates of p. mirabilis and streptococcus pneumoniae to almost all drugs are remarkable findings. the increasing or variable usage of drugs that have been used for a long time did not influence resistance markedly. in some instances the resistance rates even diminished, e.g. the tetracycline resistance of agents associated with enteric diseases. a restricted use of chloramphenicol reflected in a decreased resistance of some species. multiresistant gram-negative strains--which are resistant to all drugs frequently used in hungary--were isolated in 12.7% from a  representative clinical material. the frequent occurrence of multiresistant p. mirabilis and acinetobacter isolates is a new phenomenon. surprisingly, the percentage of multiresistant e. coli strains was very low. amikacin and netilmicin were found to be the most effective against multiresistant isolates.

TI  == endophthalmitis following intraocular lens implantation: report of 30 cases and review of the literature.
AB  == bacterial endophthalmitis is a postoperative complication of intraocular lens implantation. a review of 30 cases showed that 77% occurred within seven days of  initial cataract surgery and that all cases occurred within 32 days. common presenting symptoms and signs included pain localized to the involved eye, decreased visual acuity, conjunctival injection, anterior chamber inflammation, hypopyon, and absent or poor red reflex. diagnosis of an infectious etiology was  made by aqueous and vitreous sampling for gram stain and culture. the commonest bacterial agents were coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus, but a wide variety of gram-negative and -positive organisms were also isolated. on the basis of this series and review of the literature, optimal treatment includes prompt diagnosis by culture and gram stain of vitreous fluid, frequent application of topical antibiotics, and administration of intraocular antibiotics. intravenous antibiotics and vitrectomy may improve the visual outcome. removal of the intraocular lens is unnecessary for bacteriologic cure and is not associated with improved visual outcome.

AB  == the n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitive exchange of 2h+ of a cell for k+ of medium stable to ph, k+ activity and temperature changes has been discovered in anaerobically grown gram-negative escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium. s. enteritidis, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus salivarius, l. lactis in the presence of exogenic energy source. this exchange in gram-negative bacteria is operating only at increase of medium osmolarity. the high k+ distribution between cell and medium has been reached during the exchange of 2h+ for one k+ and the corresponding potassium equilibrium potential is much more than the measured delta psi. in aerobically grown e. coli, s. typhimurium, brevibacterium flavum and aerobic micrococcus luteus exchange of 2h+ for k+ does not take place, the k+ distribution is lower and in good conformity with the measured delta psi. it is assumed that exchange of 2h+ for k+ in anaerobic bacteria is carried out by the h+-atpase complex and the trk (or trk-like) system of k+ absorption united into the same membrane supercomplex which functions as the h+-k+-pump and supports the high k+ distribution between cell and medium.

AB  == the potential of octenidine hydrochloride (win 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. semilogarithmic survival curves were  plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against staphylococcus aureus. the microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and candida albicans. death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microm (0.94 microgram/ml)  caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and e. coli and c. albicans were the least susceptible. octenidine was more active than  chlorhexidine against each test strain. skin-degerming activities of aqueous and  formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. aqueous  octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.

TI  == lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == the most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major  problems. empyema can present an important problem in management. although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. screening of sputum gram stains under 100 x magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. the major causes of pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and legionella. however, many other organisms are  capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, s. aureus, hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae,  k. ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, proteus  mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria meningitidis and branhamella catarrhalis. several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. only minor side-effects were encountered--coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.

TI  == further characterization of bacterial adherence to urinary bladder mucosa: comparison with adherence to anion exchange resin.
AB  == bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin has recently been reported to provide a useful, rapid, in vitro screening assay for identifying putative antiadherence  agents. the studies presented in this report provide additional evidence that adherence to anion exchange resin is similar to urinary bladder mucosa adherence. results are as follows. 1) heparin inhibits the adherence of escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus fecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to both the mucin deficient bladder and anion exchange resin. 2) drugs which inhibit e. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibit e. coli adherence to  the resin and conversely, drugs which do not effect e. coli adherence to the resin do not affect attachment to the bladder. 3) extracts from mammalian urinary bladder mucosa prevent e. coli adherence to both the bladder and resin. 4) the ability of heparin to displace preattached bacteria from anion exchange resin is  inversely proportional to the time the bacteria are in contact with resin. similar results were obtained for the ability of heparin to displace bacteria from the bladder. these studies indicate that bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a manner similar  to the mucin deficient rabbit urinary bladder. because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of  bacterial attachment.

AB  == imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin, mk0787), a new carbapenem was found to have  the widest antimicrobial activity of currently available beta-lactam drugs. enterobacteriaceae had minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem of 8.0 micrograms/ml or less for 99.8 percent of clinical isolates. only rare strains of enterobacter species and proteus mirabilis have higher imipenem minimal inhibitory concentration results. hemophilus and neisseria species were inhibited, but minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem were higher than those reported for third-generation cephalosporins. only pseudomonas maltophilia  and pseudomonas cepacia strains were imipenem resistant (mic50 greater than 32 micrograms/ml) among the commonly isolated non-enteric gram-negative bacilli. all anaerobes were found susceptible to imipenem with the exception of some strains of clostridium difficile. staphylococcus species and non-enterococcal streptococci were very susceptible to imipenem. streptococcus faecalis had higher minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem (mic90 3.1 micrograms/ml) and s. faecium strains were frankly resistant. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates  had a mic90 of 27.2 micrograms imipenem/ml. imipenem was generally bactericidal except for marked minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentration differences with enterococci, listeria, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and  some p. aeruginosa strains. the minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of imipenem were not significantly influenced by organism inoculum size, probably because of its beta-lactamase stability to nearly all commonly encountered bacterial enzymes. imipenem was found to be an excellent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and a potent enzyme inducer. the induction characteristic seems responsible for the antagonistic interactions of imipenem with some enzyme-labile beta-lactams in combination. imipenem had limited stability in some in vitro susceptibility test systems. the 10 micrograms disk test or dry-form broth micro-dilution systems were preferred, applying the interpretive criteria from the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (m2-a3). imipenem-resistant strains were rarely found in clinical practice and bacteria resistant to newer beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were generally very susceptible to this new carbapenem.

TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

AB  == in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents such as abpc, sbpc, mpc, cez, ctm, cmz, ctx, cmx, czx, lmox, cpz, cfs and gm against major clinical isolates, s. aureus,  s. pyogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, c. freundii, enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris and p. aeruginosa, was examined. in this paper,  we will report the susceptibility of s. aureus, s. pyogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis during a three-year period, 1981 to approximately 1983. cez- and gm-resistant s. aureus has markedly increased and occupied 24% and 18%, respectively, in 1983. cmz and cfs have showed potent activity against cez-resistant s. aureus. it seems that the abuse of third generation-cephems and  new oral cephalosporins is closely related with the increase of cephems-resistant s. aureus. the penicillin- and cephem-resistant strains of s. pyogenes could not  be found in our study. quite a few strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis are resistant to penicillins, and also there is no appreciable change in susceptibility. some strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis showed low susceptibility to cpz, but all strains showed high susceptibility and no change in susceptibility to third generations, and these strains showed no tendency to decrease in susceptibility to gm.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == in vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. the compound was highly active against the common members of the enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. ym-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii. the activity of ym-13115 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. against haemophilus influenzae ym-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. ym-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the concentrations of ym-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78  and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit streptococcus faecalis. ym-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. ym-13115 is extremely active  against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == it has been suggested that c3 breakdown by granulocyte-neutral proteases in pleural empyemas may be related to a decreased inhibitor potential for these enzymes. in the present study it was shown that in 17 infected pleural effusions, high proteolytic activity on 125i-labeled c3 (16.3% +/- 4.4%) correlated with low functional levels of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-pi), as determined by  trypsin-inhibitory capacity (56.2 +/- 20.1 iu/ml; rs = -0.97, p less than .001),  whereas in 18 sterile pleural effusions there was no such correlation (125i-labeled c3 cleavage, 2.2% +/- .2%; trypsin-inhibitory capacity, 192.6 +/- 26.7 iu/ml). however, alpha 1-pi and alpha 2-macroglobulin protein concentrations in infected and sterile effusions (as measured by immunodiffusion) were similar.  fifteen strains of three bacterial species--streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis--isolated from patients with pneumonia or empyema inactivated the elastase-inhibitory capacity of alpha 1-pi in vitro. these results show that in empyemas functional levels of alpha 1-pi were too low  to inactivate granulocyte elastase and that some bacterial species may contribute to the low inhibitor potential of infected pleural fluid by direct alpha 1-pi inactivation.

AB  == washed suspensions of entodinium bursa were incubated anaerobically with entodinium caudatum, ten species of bacteria and a yeast. the rate of uptake and  digestion of these micro-organisms was investigated. protozoa grown in vivo did not engulf proteus mirabilis or klebsiella aerogenes but rapidly took up bacillus megaterium. selenomonas ruminantium, torulopsis glabrata and streptococcus bovis, although only the last was digested with release of soluble material into the medium. protozoa grown in vitro engulfed each of the bacteria tested, taking up megasphaera elsdenii and proteus mirabilis most rapidly. individual bacterial species and mixed rumen bacteria were engulfed more rapidly (up to 20 times) by protozoa grown in vivo than those grown in vitro, although the latter digested over 80% of the b. megaterium, escherichia coli and p. mirabilis taken up. labelled ent. caudatum was extensively digested after engulfment by ent. bursa. some of the digestion products were released into the medium but individual amino acids were transferred as such from ent. caudatum protein to ent. bursa protein.  engulfed bacteria and polysaccharide granules were transferred intact from one protozoon to the other. free amino acids were also taken up intact from the medium into protozoal protein but there was little biosynthesis of amino acids from glucose. when available for engulfment ent. caudatum was quantitatively a much more valuable source of amino acids for protein synthesis by ent. bursa than free amino acids or bacteria.

TI  == in vitro and clinical evaluation of ceforanide.
AB  == ceforanide, a new cephalosporin antibiotic with a long half-life (three hours), was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy. fifty-two patients with 56 infections due to susceptible organisms received ceforanide, 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g, intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours for four to 60 days (average: 14.1 days). the in vitro studies of our clinical isolates showed that 12.0 micrograms/ml or less of ceforanide inhibited  all streptococcus pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococci group a, b, f, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and hemophilus influenzae. after a 1 gram intramuscular dose, the mean peak serum concentration at one hour was 44.0 micrograms/ml, and at 12 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. after a 1 gram intravenous  dose, the mean peak serum concentration was 65.0 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough serum concentration at 12 hours was 9.6 micrograms/ml. the infections treated included ten pneumonias, ten urinary tract infections, seven bacteremias, two osteomyelitis, and 35 skin-soft tissue infections. of the 56 evaluable infections treated, 52 had a clinical cure with only four failures. ceforanide was well tolerated, with no patients developing thrombophlebitis, or liver or renal abnormalities. three patients developed abnormal coombs' reactions and one  had diarrhea.

TI  == effects of saliva and alpha-amylase on antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria.
AB  == two hundred and ninety-six bacterial isolates were investigated for the effects of saliva and alpha-amylase on their susceptibility to ampicillin, tetracycline,  chloramphenicol and gentamicin. when the test organisms were primed with normal and 'diseased' saliva there were no observable differences in the mics of ampicillin and chloramphenicol for group-a streptococci, but alpha-amylase significantly reduced the mic of tetracycline from 2 to 0.25 mg/1. with staphyloccus aureus, priming with saliva and alpha-amylase had no effect on the mics of gentamicin and ampicillin, whereas the mics of tetracycline and chloramphenicol were increased. the effect of saliva on the susceptibility of e.  coli to tetracycline was also significant; mic50 and mic90 were reduced from 128  to 8 and 32 mg/1 respectively. chloramphenicol was however increased from less than 0.125 to 1 and 2 mg/1 when e. coli was primed with amylase and saliva respectively. the general significance of these observations is discussed.

TI  == chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == chemiluminescence (cl) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal cl response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. we investigated the luminol-enhanced cl response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. we analyzed  the cl response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees c.  the cl response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees c. variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced cl. each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. in the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in cl: enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and zymosan. in the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pyogenes. the cl response also reflected serum opsonic activity. the effect of inactivated complement, factor b, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak cl; however, a strain of e. coli caused a variation in  peak time rather than peak height. different cl kinetics were shown for three strains of k. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or  cell wall characteristics. this study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal cl response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  == in a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics90) against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter aerogenes. subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized,  crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. the 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. the area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at  least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the mic90 for all seven groups of pathogens;  at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the mic90 against the majority of bacterial groups. in contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the mic90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin  were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. these data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the mics90  longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.

TI  == the effects of heparin on the adherence of five species of urinary tract pathogens to urinary bladder mucosa.
AB  == previous studies performed in our laboratory have indicated that the primary antibacterial defense mechanism of the rabbit urinary bladder is the antiadsorptive action of the surface mucopolysaccharide. removal of this layer with an acid rinse increases bacterial adherence up to 100 fold. exogenous mucopolysaccharide (heparin) has been shown to restore escherichia coli adherence to control levels. to determine whether this antiadherence action of heparin is species specific, we compared the adherence of 5 common urinary tract pathogens (escherichia coli, klebsiella ozonae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and streptococcus fecalis) to both mucin intact and mucin deficient rabbit bladders with and without prior heparin exposure. bacteria were radiolabeled by addition of 3h-adenine to the culture broth so that the number of bacteria adhering to the bladder could be determined using liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. results were as follows: acid removal of the mucin layer significantly increased the adherence approximately 10 fold for all 5 species tested. briefly exposing the mucin deficient bladders to heparin decreased the adherence of all species tested except pseudomonas to mucin intact control levels. heparin treatment of mucin intact bladders slightly decreased adherence of all species except pseudomonas below mucin intact controls, however, results were not statistically significant. the magnitude of klebsiella adherence was nearly 20 fold greater than all other species tested. while this non-species specific adherence inhibition of heparin may prove useful in the clinical setting, it appears to be less effective against pseudomonas.

TI  == a microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of escherichia coli, enterobacter, klebsiella, proteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis. using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. a regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. the results on mueller-hinton agar are very similar to those on iso-sensitest medium. like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.

AB  == dl-8280, 9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7h- pyrido-(1,2,3-de)1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid, is a new nalidixic acid analog with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and  gram-positive bacteria, including obligate anaerobes. the activity of dl-8280 against enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and clostridium perfringens was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and far exceeded that of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. dl-8280 had greater activity against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., pseudomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., and bacteroides fragilis than did norfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and nalidixic acid. nalidixic acid-resistant enterobacteriaceae, ampicillin-resistant gonococci, and clindamycin-resistant obligate anaerobes were also susceptible to dl-8280. the activity of dl-8280 was  affected very little by inoculum size, and its action was bactericidal at two times the minimal inhibitory concentrations at most. administered orally to mice  experimentally infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, or p. aeruginosa, dl-8280 was 2 to 7 times more effective than norfloxacin and 7 to more than 50 times more active than pipemidic acid.

TI  == detection of group b streptococcal antigen in early-onset and late-onset group b  streptococcal disease with the wellcogen strep b latex agglutination test.
AB  == the wellcogen strep b latex agglutination test (wellcome diagnostics, dartford, england) was evaluated as a method of detecting group b streptococcal antigen in  urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum from neonates with early-onset (less than or equal to 7 days of age) and late-onset group b streptococcal disease. urine was the best source of antigen, which was detected in 100% of six neonates with early-onset group b streptococcal disease who had urine available in the first 12 h of illness and in 88% of 17 group b streptococcus-infected neonates with urine  available in the first 48 h of illness. antigen was not detected in any samples from patients without group b streptococcal disease except in the urine of one patient with proteus mirabilis meningitis. the wellcogen strep b latex test of the lot tested compares favorably with a noncommercially available latex agglutination test.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefmenoxime.
AB  == the activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. it was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. it had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group a and b streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae.  it did not inhibit streptococcus faecalis or listeria spp. cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam  against escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, salmonella, and shigella. it inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter  aerogenes, and enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration  for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), proteus vulgaris and providencia spp. it was as active as ceftizoxime was against serratia. pseudomonas spp. and bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for  90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). the compound was stable to the  common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of tem. it was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by bacteroides and acinetobacter.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

TI  == rapid differentiation of bacterial meningitides by direct gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == rapid identification of haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (glc) of the metabolic by-products in  broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in new zealand white male rabbits. these results were correlated with the glc of csf of meningitis patients. a major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including h. influenzae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and listeria monocytogenes. succinic acid was also found in the csf of experimental meningitis and in the csf of all patients with h. influenzae and  esch. coli meningitis. this peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. it was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria meningitidis. succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in h. influenzae meningitis for at  least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. in one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by glc in the csf excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests h. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.

TI  == efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  == ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. the clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. the bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. there were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. no serious drug toxicities were observed. at a dosage regimen of 1 g  every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.

TI  == bacterial infections in a hospital-based skilled nursing facility.
AB  == the incidence of bacterial infections occurring in 132 residents in a veterans administration hospital-based nursing home care unit (va nhcu) was studied retrospectively over a 1 yr period. there were a total of 35 non-foley-catheter-related bacterial infections documented during this time, occurring in 21 residents. of these infections, 14 were pulmonary, 18 urinary and 3 of the integument. of the 23 residents having indwelling urinary catheters, 47.8% became clinically symptomatic due to a urinary infection at least one time  during the year. thirty-six per cent of these infections were due to pseudomonas  aeruginosa and 48% were due to e. coli and proteus mirabilis. eighteen of 23 residents (78.3%) with foley catheters had more than one predominant organism cultured from their urine during the year, making the practice of monthly cultures not very useful in considering treatment. if one grouped all urinary tract infections on the nhcu, the major pathogens were pseudomonas (19.5%), klebsiella (17.1%). proteus (17.1%) and e. coli (14.6%). documented pulmonary infections were predominantly due to streptococcus pneumonia (50.0%) and hemophilus influenza (35.7%). our data suggest that the location of the institutional setting must be considered in caring for the elderly resident in a  skilled nursing facility. future plans to establish hospital based nursing home units must consider the benefits resulting from easy access to acute health care  and educational programs against problems of hospital bacterial flora.

TI  == antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of ceftazidime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin potentially active against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ceftazidime were evaluated  against 700 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ceftazidime was less active than penicillins or older cephalosporins against staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., and it did not inhibit streptococcus faecalis, listeria, or anaerobic species. ceftazidime was as active as ceftizoxime and moxalactam and more active than cefoperazone against escherichia coli. klebsiella, and proteus mirabilis with minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than 0.2 mg/liter. ceftazidime also inhibited enterobacter, citrobacter, salmonella, and shigella at concentrations below 0.2 mg/liter. most morganella, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris, and proteus inconstans were inhibited at concentrations below 1 mg/liter, similar to the concentrations for moxalactam, ceftizoxime, and cefotaxime. ceftazidime was the most active agent tested against pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a mean minimal inhibitory concentration of 1.6 mg/liter. it inhibited carbenicillin-, piperacillin-, cefoperazone-, and cefsulodin-resistant  pseudomonas. minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations were similar, with the exception of some pseudomonas values at 10(7) colony-forming units. use of different media did not alter minimal inhibitory concentration values. ceftazidime was not hydrolyzed by staphylococcal beta-lactamase or plasmid beta-lactamase of the tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, oxa-1, pse-1, pse-2 types or by inducible beta-lactamases of the cephalosporinase type. ceftazidime provides an extremely active agent against aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == persistent suppression of bacterial growth following exposure of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to numerous antimicrobial agents was studied. the persistent, or postantibiotic, effect was quantitated by periodic counts of colony-forming units after removal of the drug by washing, dilution, or inactivation with penicillinase. although a postantibiotic effect was observed with all drugs studied, there were marked differences among drugs in their postantibiotic effects on certain organisms. with gram-positive organisms, concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics near the minimal inhibitory concentration produced persistent effects lasting 1-3 hr. with gram-negative organisms much higher concentrations were required to elicit a postantibiotic effect. inhibitors of protein and rna synthesis produced the longest persistent suppression of growth, which was of comparable duration in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. only a short persistent effect of gentamicin was observed with staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, but a postantibiotic effect lasting 1.6-2.6 hr was observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa. the duration of the  postantibiotic effect was related linearly to concentration of drug and duration  of exposure up to a point of maximal response. persistent effects following exposure to antibiotics were also demonstrated in 90% human serum.

TI  == in vitro antagonism by erythromycin of the bactericidal action of antimicrobial agents against common respiratory pathogens.
AB  == ten strains each of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pneumoniae were tested in vitro against erythromycin combined with ampicillin, cefamandole, or gentamicin. antagonism by  erythromycin occurred with 47% of the combinations involving strains of s. aureus and to a lesser degree with h. influenzae. synergy occurred most commonly with h. influenzae (27%). the high frequency of antagonism and synergy with these organisms was associated with a broad range of bacteriostatic action by erythromycin against these same bacteria. the implications for the treatment of pneumonia are discussed.

TI  == ro 13-9904, a long-acting broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == ro 13-9904, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was found to have high in vitro activity against enterobacteriaceae and other gram-negative bacteria, including various isolates resistant to cefuroxime, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefazolin.  it showed promising activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. although inhibitory  against staphylococcus aureus at concentrations readily achievable in plasma, it  was less potent against this pathogen than cefamandole, cefazolin, or cefuroxime. isolates of streptococcus faecalis were uniformly resistant to all the cephalosporins tested. ro 13-9904 was more active than cefotaxime against proteus mirabilis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, and haemophilus influenzae, but less active against s. aureus. ro 13-9904 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases. its therapeutic efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice was equal to or slightly superior to that of cefotaxime and sce-1365 when the antibiotics were administered in repeated subcutaneous doses after bacterial challenge. cefoperazone, and particularly cefamandole nafate, cefazolin, and mezlocillin were less effective. although structurally related to  cefotaxime and sce-1365, ro 13-9904 was found to differ from them in one important respect, namely, in having a long duration of action; this was observed with single-dose treatment given before bacterial challenge. its broad spectrum of activity coupled with favorable pharmacokinetic properties make ro 13-9904 a promising compound for clinical studies.

TI  == bacterial effect of hydrogen peroxide on urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags is a frequent source of bladder  bacteriuria in patients with indwelling catheters. previous work demonstrated that the addition of 30 ml of 3% h2o2 prevented bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags for up to 8 h in patients with urinary infections (greater  than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml). survival curves of a variety of organisms in filter-sterilized urine with various concentrations of h2o2 (0.6 to  0.01%) were constructed. organisms with high cellular catalase activity (staphylococcus aureus, serratia marcescens, and proteus mirabilis) required 30 to 60 min of exposure to 0.6% h2o2 for a reduction of 10(8) to less than 1 colony-forming unit per ml, whereas escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., and pseudomonas sp. required only 15 min of exposure. the efficacy of h2o2 in urine was maintained despite exposure to room temperature for 5 days and reinoculation  with bacterial suspensions. h2o2 is inexpensive and relatively nontoxic, and these data suggest that periodic instillation of h2o2 into urinary drainage bags  may eliminate a source of bladder bacteriuria and environmental contamination.

AB  == cefadroxil (duricef, mead johnson and company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates  under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. in this kinetic model, cefadroxil  was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of escherichia coli. the other strain of e. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. s. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.

TI  == the recovery period following exposure of bacteria to penicillins.
AB  == experiments with staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes have shown that when cells are exposed to bactericidal concentration of benzylpenicillin or ampicillin and the antibiotic then inactivated with beta-lactamase the count of the surviving viable cells (colony-forming units) remains essentially constant for a period of approximately 1.5--3 h before increasing at a normal rate. no such recovery period was observed, however, when escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis was exposed to a bactericidal concentration of ampicillin and the antibiotic then inactivated. microscopic observation of individual surviving cells of s. aureus following exposure to benzylpenicillin showed that in some cases resumption of cell division was delayed as long as 4 h. however, other cells in the same population showed no recovery period and resumed division within 30 min of inactivation of the antibiotic. in the latter case, the recovery period which is observed in terms of viable count may represent the period of time required for individual surviving cells to divide and give rise to normal aggregates before these fragment to produce new colony-forming units.

AB  == the antibacterial activities of three aminopenicillins ampicillin, epicillin and  amoxycillin were compared in vitro and in vivo. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the three penicillins were very similar and the compounds were active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of escherichia coli, salmonella and shigella species, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. streptococci including streptococcus faecalis, and non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were also sensitive to the compounds but pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter and indole-positive proteus species were resistant. at concentrations close to mic value epicillin and ampicillin showed similar bactericidal activity against e. coli and against s. typhi and both compounds caused a slower rate of kill than was seen with amoxycillin. microscopical observation of the cells exposed to ampicillin and epicillin for 1 h showed the presence of filamentous forms which lysed slowly, whereas cells exposed to amoxycillin for the same period rapidly. epicillin was similar to or slightly less active than ampicillin against experimental mouse infections, and against the majority of infections both compounds were significantly less effective than amoxycillin by the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration.

AB  == the effect of specific immunization on the antibacterial defense mechanisms of the murine lung was assessed against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus aureus (smith), serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. immunization by aerosol inhalation significantly enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis but not the remaining organisms. with p. mirabilis, systemic immunization induced higher titers of specific serum  agglutinins as compared with local respiratory tract immunization; however, local immunization was more effective in enhancing pulmonary bactericidal activity than was parenteral vaccination. passive immunity against p. mirabilis or aerogenic challenge with preopsonized p. mirabilis significantly enhanced intrapulmonary killing of the homologous organism. with s. aureus, pulmonary bactericidal activity was not accelerated by aerosol challenge with the preopsonized organism, nor was it accelerated in passively immunized mice. these data demonstrate that the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity is governed by the bacterium used for challenge and the route of immunization. the results further demonstrate that with p. mirabilis, antibody-mediated mechanisms are involved in  the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity.

AB  == the role of peroxidase-mediated bacterial killing by rabbit alveolar macrophages  was examined. during 3 h of incubation in vitro, alveolar macrophages ingested and killed greater than 88% of the streptococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, or  streptococcus pneumoniae present in the incubation mixture. preincubation of alveolar macrophages with inhibitors of catalase, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole or sodium nitrite, did not alter their bactericidal potential. iodination of ingested zymosan particles, a peroxidase-dependent and hydrogen peroxide-dependent reaction, was not observed, in spite of vigorous phagocytosis  by alveolar macrophages. furthermore, iodination by alveolar macrophages was not  significantly increased when peroxidase-coated zymosan particles were ingested. the results suggest that hydrogen peroxide may not be available to the phagocytic vacuole for microbial killing. since tetrazolium dye reduction reflects the activity of an oxidase responsible for stimulated oxygen consumption by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, this reaction was also measured. rabbit alveolar macrophages incubated with latex particles did not exhibit an increased dye reduction compared with resting cells. the absence of significant stimulation of  tetrazolium dye reduction indicates that the oxidase reaction does not occur in the proximity of the phagocytic vacuole of alveolar macrophages.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cefoxitin, cephamycin c, cepharadine and cefazolin was determined against 443 isolates of bacteria. at a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml, all of the cephalosporins inhibited more than 60% of the isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae.  at the same concentration, cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cephamycin c and cefazolin inhibited more than 90% of isolates of proteus mirabilis. all of the cephalosporins except cephalothin and cephapirin inhibited  over 60% of isolates of escherichia coli at a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml. cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against gram-negative bacilli. there  was substantial differences in the activity of cephalosporins against gram-positive cocci. cephaloridine was the most active cephalosporin against these organisms. there was considerable fluctuation in the proportion of isolates of gram-negative bacilli susceptible to these cephalosporins from year to year, but there was no evidence to suggest that the number of resistant isolates was increasing.

TI  == evaluation of amniotic fluid for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == studies of 117 pregnant women, 83 at term, were instituted to determine the bacteriologic state of amniotic fluid, utilizing both standard aerobic and anaerobic technics. a high association of postpartum infection was found in women who had long periods of premature reptured membranes and many vaginal examinations. significant organisms including anaerobes, were isolated in many of these instances. based on the findings of these studies, it is recommended that amniocentesis for aerobic and anaerobic cultures be done when membranes have been ruptured for 8 hours or more, and when the patient has had seven or more vaginal  examinations during the course of labor.

TI  == infected total hip replacement after dental procedures.
AB  == three cases are reported in which there was a worrisome association between dental work and an infected total hip replacement. the patients had long asymptomatic intervals subsequent to implantation of prosthetic hip joints. after dental procedures, infections became apparent in these hips. such infections carry an enormous and crippling morbidity. the potential complications of transient bacteremia in the patient with a cardiac valvular prosthesis are appreciated and the importance of prophylactic antibodies for dental work in such patients is well known. although we emphasize that there is no proof that the infections in our patients were metastatic from the mouth, the sequence of events is suggestive. we recommend prophylactic antibiotics for dental work in the patient with a total hip replacement.

TI  == the elimination of urease activity in streptococcus faecium as evidence for plasmid-coded urease.
AB  == a strain of streptococcus faecium from the sheep rumen showed spontaneous loss of urease activity when subcultured at the normal rumen temperature of 38 degrees c, although in mixed cultures in vivo or in vitro loss of urease was not apparent. the rate of loss of urease in pure cultures was increased at incubation temperatures above 38 degrees c, but loss was never complete. however, at temperatures below 38 degrees c loss was greater, and at 22 or 18 degrees c the urease was completely eliminated. incubation with sodium dodecyl sulphate (0-002%) or ethidium bromide (2-5 x 10(-5)m) caused complete loss of urease activity. the urease activity was also eliminated when the streptococcus was grown aerobically, and this loss of activity was irreversible. it is suggested that the urease activity is controlled by a plasmid gene and that aeration, low growth temperature and chemical agents 'cure' the streptococcus of the plasmid. attempts to demonstrate the presence of covalently closed circular extrachromosomal dna by caesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium density-gradient centrifugation were unsuccessful.

TI  == bactericidal activity and pharmacology of flucloxacillin.
AB  == flucloxacillin, a recent addition to the group of isoxazolyl penicillins, was studied in vitro and in normal volunteers. the bactericidal activity of the drug  against most strains of gram-positive bacteria including penicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was similar to that of oxacillin and approximately fourfold greater than that of cloxacillin. each of the three penicillins was administered  orally to a group of ten volunteers for eight days in a dose of 500 mg four times a day. the mean concentrations of flucloxacillin in the serum were two- to sixfold higher than those of the other two agents on the first, fourth and eighth days of therapy. the percentage of flucloxacillin bound by serum protein was 94.6 per cent; for cloxacillin and oxacillin the values were 93.5 and 91.5 per cent, respectively. using these data, the concentrations of free flucloxacillin in serum were found to be twice as high as those of cloxacillin and oxacillin. these findings suggest that, when administered orally, this new agent may offer some therapeutic advantage over oxacillin and cloxacillin.

TI  == abnormal forms of bacteria produced by antibiotics.
AB  == subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can produce in vitro aberrant forms of bacteria that are similar to those observed in specimens and cultures from patients being treated with antibacterial agents. eight species of bacteria were  grown on membranes placed on agar containing subinhibitory concentrations of nine antibiotics. the resulting organisms were examined by gram stain and electron microscopy. gram stains showed filamentous and granular forms of enterobacteria with bipolar staining, giant staphylococci, and rodlike pneumococci. electron micrographs showed changes in the number and distribution of ribosomes in enterobacteria and septum abnormalities in cocci. such abnormal forms can occasionally simulate the appearance of quite different species, and they may indicate the presence of a subinhibitory antibiotic concentration at the site of  infection as a result of prior antibacterial therapy.

TI  == bacterial studies of clindamycin-associated colitis. a preliminary report.
AB  == the cause of pseudomembraneous colitis is not known but has been attributed to an alteration in the microbial flora of the colon. to test this hypothesis, a blind, prospective study was undertaken in which fecal samples were cultured quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. the patients from which these samples were taken were all receiving clindamycin and had diarrhea secondary to the use of the drug. we were able to show definite differences in the colonic microflora which correlated with the presence of pseudomembranes on biopsy. those patients who had diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis showed a striking decrease, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the number of anaerobes present. those patients who had diarrhea but no pseudomembranes had large numbers of anaerobes which qualitatively approximated normal fecal cultures but quantitatively were fewer in number. a third group of patients, which had resolving pseudomembranous colitis, and were no longer symptomatic, had large numbers of anaerobic organisms which approximated those found in normal fecal cultures. there were no differences among the three groups with regard to facultative anaerobic microflora. thus, the presence of pseudomembranous colitis  correlated directly with a striking quantitative and qualitative decrease in the  anaerobic microflora of the colon. the symptom of diarrhea alone appeared to have no meaning with regard to changes in the bacterial flora. resolution of pseudomembranous colitis was associated with a return of the anaerobic microflora.

TI  == systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == metabolism of deoxycorticosterone by human fecal flora.
AB  == 21-dehydroxylation, a feature of metabolism of corticoids in humans, was observed in mixed cultures of fecal flora of normal individuals on a western diet. the model substrate, 11-deoxycorticosterone (doc), was metabolized to 3alpha-21-dihydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one (thdoc), 3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan20-one (pregnanolone), and to two unidentified structures, metabolites x and y. doc was not metabolized in all media supporting  growth of fecal flora. conversion required an initial ph between 6.0 and 8.0. 21-dehydroxylation occurred within 4 days of incubation in media inoculated with  10-minus 1 to 10-minus 7 fecal suspensions. in higher dilutions, containing obligatory anaerobes only, doc was converted to metabolite x and sometimes also to metabolite y. the yield of pregnanolone was related to the promptness with which the specimen was processed, to the presence of cysteine in the medium, and  to the concentrationof substrate (optimum, 16 to 64 mug of doc per ml). the yield of thdoc was related to the delay in the processing of the specimen, the concentration of substrate (maximum at 256 mug/ml), and aeration of the culture.  pure cultures of aerobic organism of fecal origin either failed to metabolize doc or converted it to metabolite y. pure cultures of fecal anaerobes converted doc to metabolite x and sometimes also to metabolite y. neither thdoc nor pregnanolone was produced by pure cultures.

AB  == in this study the disc sensitivities of five organisms growing in pure cultures (staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans) were first determined against each  of seven antibacterial agents (penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, silver nitrate, sulfamylon, and betadine). then the sensitivity of each organism  growing in combination with one of the others (10 combinations) was tested against each of the same antibacterials. significantly increased and decreased sensitivities were found in 30 percent of the cultures with decreases largely predominating. total obliteration of all sensitivity occurred 10 percent of the time. the changes in sensitivity were not distributed randomly but rather were associated more with particular agents and organisms. sulfamylon, was associated  with decreases 70 percent of the time with sensitivity obliteration in 50 percent of the tests. streptococcus led all the organisms, being associated with decreases in half of the tests. it is possible that mixed-culture sensitivities could provide the most valid information when mixed infections exist, since they  more closely simulate the real clinical situation. therefore it is suggested that both mixed and pure culture sensitivity testing be done for all mixed infections.

TI  == in vitro antibody-enzyme conjugates with specific bactericidal activity.
AB  == igg with antibacterial antibody opsonic activity was isolated from rabbit antisera produced by intravenous hyperimmunization with several test strains of pneumococci, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, proteus  mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. antibody-enzyme conjugates were prepared, using diethylmalonimidate to couple glucose oxidase to  igg antibacterial antibody preparations. opsonic human igg obtained from serum of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis was also conjugated to glucose oxidase. antibody-enzyme conjugates retained combining specificity for test bacteria as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. in vitro test for bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates utilized potassium iodide, lactoperoxidase, and glucose as cofactors. under these conditions glucose oxidase conjugated to antibody generates hydrogen peroxide, and lactoperoxidase enzyme catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with simultaneous oxidation of i(-)  and halogenation and killing of test bacteria. potent in vitro bactericidal activity of this system was repeatedly demonstrated for antibody-enzyme conjugates against pneumococci, streptococci, s. aureus, p. mirabilis, and e. coli. however, no bactericidal effect was demonstrable with antibody-enzyme conjugates and two test strains of p. aeruginosa. bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates appeared to parallel original opsonic potency of unconjugated igg preparations. antibody-enzyme conjugates at concentrations as low as 0.01 mg/ml were capable of intense bactericidal activity producing substantial drops in surviving bacterial counts within 30-60 min after initiation of assay. these in vitro bactericidal systems indicate that the concept of antibacterial antibody-enzyme conjugates may possibly be adaptable as a mechanism for treatment of patients with leukocyte dysfunction or fulminant bacteremia.

AB  == cefazolin sodium, a cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro and  in 26 patients. cefazolin had activity equivalent to cephalothin against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci, and proteus mirabilis. cefazolin was four- to eightfold more active against escherichia coli and slightly more active against klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas  cephalothin was slightly more active against indole-positive proteus species. after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin intramuscularly, peak concentrations in the serum were high enough to inhibit all strains of s. pneumoniae, s. aureus, group  a streptococci, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis, as well as 60% of strains of proteus species other than p. mirabilis. all of 26 patients (18 with pneumonia, 6 with urinary tract infection, and 2 with skin infections) responded  clinically and bacteriologically to cefazolin therapy. there were no major side effects of therapy, and no patient complained of pain at the site of intramuscular injection. cefazolin is an effective cephalosporin which can be used intramuscularly for therapy of serious bacterial infections. its major advantages over other cephalosporins are higher, more sustained concentrations in the blood and apparent lack of pain on intramuscular injection.

TI  == butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  == butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. significantly susceptible bacteria include strains  of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae,  proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris, salmonella enteritidis and s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri and s. sonnei. good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained  in various acute mouse infections. butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  == amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

AB  == 7-[alpha-(1-methyl-4-pyridiniothio)-acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, referred to  herein as bl-s 217, is a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that offers several advantages over cephalothin. a comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that bl-s 217 is about eightfold more effective against streptococcus pyogenes and diplococcus pneumoniae. against gram-negative  bacteria, bl-s 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., bl-s 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both escherichia coli and klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against salmonella and enterobacter. overall, of 208 strains of enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to bl-s 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. bl-s 217 was less bound  to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. the ld(50) of bl-s 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. when administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in s. pyogenes and d. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an e. coli infection. its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis.

TI  == media exchange method for demonstrating killing of l-phase variants in solid media by normal human serum.
AB  == normal human serum has been shown to kill l-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. this failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and nacl. a method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some l-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the l-phase variants of staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi. this method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for l-phase variants.

AB  == bacteriocin activity of streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes was tested against  a variety of bacteria, l-forms, and mycoplasmas. both a partially purified liquid preparation and a colony overlay technique were used. other s. faecalis strains were the only bacteria whose growth was inhibited. the liquid preparation inhibited growth of all but three of the tested l-forms (whether derived from gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria), and two of these exceptional organisms  were inhibited when the colony overlay technique was employed. on the other hand, the l-form of streptobacillus moniliformis and all 33 tested mycoplasmas grew readily in the presence of the bacteriocin when either method was employed. it is suggested that the presence of cholesterol in the streptobacillus and mycoplasmal membranes, unique in this regard among procaryotic cells, may be responsible for  the differential pattern of growth inhibition.

AB  == concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. the in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. all strains of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. of the staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all s. aureus, 80% of escherichia coli, 72% of klebsiella-aerobacter, and 56% of proteus mirabilis strains. about 90 to 96% of e. coli, klebsiella aerobacter, and p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. pseudomonas and indole-positive proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. a peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. a mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. food did not interfere with absorption. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. over 90% of the administered dose was excreted  in the urine within 6 hr. the mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group a streptococci, d. pneumoniae, and s. aureus, 85% of e. coli, and about 40 to 75% of klebsiella-aerobacter and p. mirabilis strains. levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of e. coli, and p. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of klebsiella-aerobacter strains.

TI  == effect of different media on in vitro studies of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == in an effort to determine the adequacy of a standard broth medium in the evaluation of antibiotic combinations, 20 strains of various bacterial species were studied simultaneously in mueller-hinton broth and in freshly drawn human serum from apparently healthy volunteers. studies of growth dynamics by use of the usual plate dilution technique for quantitating colony-forming units were performed with strains of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible), streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, aerobacter, klebsiella, and proteus mirabilis. a variety of different antibiotics were investigated. with 19 of the 20 strains, interpretations of synergism or antagonism were the same in both media. therefore, despite minor variations when  the same strain was studied in both serum and broth, it is concluded that mueller-hinton broth is an adequate medium for use in studies of chemotherapeutic combinations in vitro. a simplified method for studying bactericidal activity is  described, which is deemed practical for clinical microbiology laboratories and which led to the same conclusions regarding the combinations as were obtained by  the more arduous plate dilution test.

TI  == bacterial interference induced in embryonated eggs by staphylococci.
AB  == studies of experimental infections in embryonated eggs demonstrated that prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci afforded significant protection  against subsequent challenge with virulent strains. all strains of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci tested that were relatively avirulent for embryonated eggs were capable of producing interference. the interference induced afforded protection not only against challenge with virulent staphylococci, but also against diplococcus pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and one strain of influenza virus (a(2)j 305). prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci also protected against intravenous as well as allantoic infection with challenge strains.interference required infection with viable bacteria. the onset of interference appeared within a few minutes after injection of the interfering strain, but was not maximal until 24 hours had elapsed between injection of the interfering and challenge strains. the protection afforded by the production of interference could not be overcome by increased inoculum size of the challenge strain and extended even to challenge with 10(9) bacteria. studies of in vitro and in vivo growth of challenge strains in allantoic fluid demonstrated that some interfering strains inhibited growth of the challenge strains. other strains produced interference without producing prolonged inhibition of the growth of challenge strains. similarly, interference could not be attributed to attenuated  virulence of the challenge organisms. all interfering strains studied produced enhanced bactericidal activity of whole blood from the affected embryos, but whether this affected leukocyte activity, opsonization, or other host defense mechanisms has yet to be determined.

AB  == chang, te-wen (tufts university school of medicine, boston, mass.) and louis weinstein. in vitro biological activity of cephalothin. j. bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. shigella, salmonella, and proteus mirabilis were the most  sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and  herellea were highly resistant. penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of s. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with s. aureus. cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. this antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin g but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
