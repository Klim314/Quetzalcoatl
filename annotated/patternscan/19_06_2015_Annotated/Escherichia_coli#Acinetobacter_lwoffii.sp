TI  == identification of 50 class d beta-lactamases and 65 acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinases in acinetobacter spp.
AB  == whole-genome sequencing of a collection of 103 acinetobacter strains belonging to 22 validly named species and another 16 putative species allowed detection of genes for 50 new class d beta-lactamases and 65 new acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinases (adc). all oxacillinases (oxa) contained the three typical motifs of class d beta-lactamases, stfk, (f/y)gn, and k(s/t)g. the phylogenetic tree drawn from the oxa sequences led to an increase in the number of oxa groups  from 7 to 18. the topologies of the oxa and rpob phylogenetic trees were similar, supporting the ancient acquisition of blaoxa genes by acinetobacter species. the  class d beta-lactamase genes appeared to be intrinsic to several species, such as acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter pittii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and acinetobacter lwoffii. neither blaoxa-40/143- nor blaoxa-58-like genes were detected, and their origin remains therefore unknown. the phylogenetic tree analysis based on the alignment of the sequences deduced from blaadc revealed five main clusters, one containing adc belonging to species closely related to a. baumannii and the others composed of cephalosporinases from the remaining species. no indication of blaoxa or blaadc transfer was observed between distantly related species, except for blaoxa-279, possibly transferred from acinetobacter genomic species 6 to acinetobacter parvus. analysis of beta-lactam  susceptibility of seven strains harboring new oxacillinases and cloning of the corresponding genes in escherichia coli and in a susceptible a. baumannii strain  indicated very weak hydrolysis of carbapenems. overall, this study reveals a large pool of beta-lactamases in different acinetobacter spp., potentially transferable to pathogenic strains of the genus.

TI  == bacterial pleuritis with thickened mesothelial hyperplasia in a young beagle dog.
AB  == a five-month-old male beagle dog suddenly became moribund. bloody fluid accumulated in the thoracic and abdominal cavities, and soft yellow flecks were floating in the thoracic fluid. the mediastinum and pericardium became dark reddish with villous thickening. other parietal and pulmonary pleurae were rough, and the organs adhered to each other. histologically, most mediastinal pleura formed papillary projections covered by a single layer of mesothelial cells. many macrophages and neutrophils infiltrated the submesothelial connective tissue. at  the mediastinum adjacent to the pericardium, cuboidal mesothelial cells proliferated solidly and formed a thick surface stratum. the flecks consisted of  gram-negative filamentous or small bacillary (coccoid) bacteria. in the right posterior lobe of the lung, neutrophilic infiltration and a large encapsulated abscess including a bacterial colony were present. we diagnosed this case as "bacterial pleuritis with thickened mesothelial hyperplasia". the cause of the pleuritis might be a chronic pleural infection spread via the lung abscess.

TI  == antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiverotoxic potentials of extracts of curtisia dentata.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: there is an increase in antimicrobial resistance  and complexities arising from verotoxic related bacterial infections as well as rise in demand for application of natural antioxidants to combat oxidative damage by free radicals in many oxidative stress-mediated disease conditions such as cancer. thus the potential of curtisia dentata as antimicrobial, antioxidant and  antiverotoxin against environmental isolates of escherichia coli and acinetobacter spp. as well as the presence of phytochemicals and some organic compounds, was determined. materials and methods: phytochemical analysis was carried out using standard methods and antioxidant activity was determined using  the dpph radical scavenging activity. effect of extracts on bacterial cell wall was also determined. results: extracts contained anthraquinones, alkaloids, essential oils, glycosides, phenols, steroids, saponins, tannins, quinones, anthocyanins, amines and carboxylic acids as phytochemicals. extracts demonstrated high antimicrobial activity and low minimum inhibitory concentrations as well as inhibitory action against the expression of both vtx1 and vtx2 genes in escherichia coli, acinetobacter haemolyticus and acinetobacter  lwoffii. ethanol root bark extracts consistently showed the highest dpph radical  scavenging activity (62.43%), total phenol content (tph) (57.62 26 mg gae/g) and  reducing power (rp) (41.32%), followed by those of the stem bark and leaf extracts with the respective values of 54.68%, 37.77 mg gae/g and 21.83%. the extracts induced the leakage of na(+) and k(+) ions from both test bacteria. conclusion: curtisia dentata is a very effective source of antioxidant and a possible alternative to sourcing antiverotoxic antibiotics with novel mechanism of action.

TI  == the use of multiplex real-time pcr improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. knowledge of pathogens causing cap constitutes  the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). this study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time pcr as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of cap (streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila) in cap patients attending hospital tengku ampuan afzan (htaa)/ kuantan, pahang, malaysia. two previously developed multiplex real-time pcr assays, duplex for the differential detection of s. pneumoniae and b. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of cap in blood and respiratory  samples. thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult cap patients admitted to htaa were analysed by multiplex real-time pcr assays and conventional methods. the microbial etiology of cap could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of cap patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time pcr. the most frequently detected pathogens were s. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by pcr alone), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), b. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by pcr alone and  17% by both culture and pcr), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), m. pneumoniae (6.5%  - all by serology), c. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both pcr and serology), l. pneumophila (2.1% - all by pcr alone), escherichia coli (4.3%). haemophilus infuenzae, acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).

TI  == helicobacter pylori directs tolerogenic programming of dendritic cells.
AB  == our laboratory has shown that helicobacter pylori infection in mice triggers an increase in the number of subepithelial lamina propria cd11c(+) dendritic cells with luminal projections. the physical characteristic of these cells is consistent with their ability to traverse epithelial tight junctions as reported  by maria recigno.3 gastric cd103(+) dendritic cells, which are known to induce mucosal regulatory t cells, were also increased in number, raising the question whether h. pylori infection induces a regulatory t cell-skewed response by way of a bacteria-dendritic cell interaction. in fact, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells underwent tolerogenic programming, skewing the balance between effector and regulatory t cell responses towards regulatory t cell differentiation in a transforming growth factor-beta- and interleukin-10-dependent manner. depletion of regulatory t cell numbers augmented h. pylori-specific effector helper t cell  responses, which correlated with a lower degree of h. pylori colonization. these  results suggest h. pylori is capable of inducing a regulatory t cell-skewed response that limits the host's ability to eradicate the bacteria, allowing the h. pylori infection to persist. to better understand the mechanism of h. pylori tolerogenic programming we compared the differential expressions of 34 genes critical for dendritic cell function in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells pulsed with live h. pylori or other gram-negative bacteria (e.g., escherichia coli, acinetobacter lwoffii). our data imply that h. pylori targets the toll-like receptor 2 pathway to induce a regulatory t cell-skewed response. in addition, we show that h. pylori-pulsed dendritic cells are capable of inducing the conversion of naive t cells to regulatory t cells. these observations are evidence of a unique tolerogenic program in dendritic cells that involves active editing of the immune response by h. pylori, favoring its persistence in the gastric mucosa.

TI  == oxa-134, a naturally occurring carbapenem-hydrolyzing class d beta-lactamase from acinetobacter lwoffii.
AB  == acinetobacter lwoffii, a species whose natural habitat is the human skin, intrinsically possesses a chromosomal gene encoding a carbapenem-hydrolyzing class d beta-lactamase, oxa-134. this species may therefore constitute a reservoir for carbapenemase genes that may spread among other acinetobacter species.

TI  == application of pcr-sscp for molecular epidemiological studies on the exposure of  farm children to bacteria in environmental dust.
AB  == the environmental exposure of farm children to microorganisms in dust has become  a focus of interest, since microbial exposure on farms has been related to a reduced prevalence of asthma and atopic diseases in children. previous studies almost exclusively focused on the determination of microbial counts using conventional culturing or the determination of microbial compounds i.e. endotoxins. in this study pcr-sscp (single-strand conformation polymorphism) was  modified for characterising bacterial communities in environmental dusts and their sensitivity and reproducibility was validated. a fivefold repeated pcr-sscp analyses of a well homogenised mattress dust, cow-shed dust, swine-shed dust, chicken-shed dust and a horse-shed dust sample, respectively, showed similarities, based on pearson correlations, ranging from 89.7% to 95.2%. the reproducibility of day to day variations (five days) and gel to gel variations (five gels) was also around 90%. the detection limit of escherichia coli was 7 x  10(1) cfu g(-1) whereas listeria monocytogenes and bacillus licheniformis containing 30% spores showed visible bands at 7 x1 0(2) cfu g(-1). application of this method to dust samples of 37 sheds and 63 children's mattresses showed that  distinct farm environment dusts reflected different sscp profiles. however, digital analysis of the gels showed that some bands in the profiles of shed- and  mattress dusts were found at the same position in the gels. by excision, cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses, these bands were identified as corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, corynebacterium mucifaciens, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinetobacter lwoffii, brevibacterium iodinum, brevibacterium linens and arthrobacter spp, respectively. these results may reflect transfer of microorganisms from animal sheds to mattresses. in conclusion this study demonstrates that pcr-sscp is a promising method with sensitive detection limits  and moderate sample variances to be applied for epidemiological studies characterizing the exposure of farmers using environmental dust.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == diagnostics of neisseriaceae and moraxellaceae by ribosomal dna sequencing: ribosomal differentiation of medical microorganisms.
AB  == fast and reliable identification of microbial isolates is a fundamental goal of clinical microbiology. however, in the case of some fastidious gram-negative bacterial species, classical phenotype identification based on either metabolic,  enzymatic, or serological methods is difficult, time-consuming, and/or inadequate. 16s or 23s ribosomal dna (rdna) bacterial sequencing will most often  result in accurate speciation of isolates. therefore, the objective of this study was to find a hypervariable rdna stretch, flanked by strongly conserved regions,  which is suitable for molecular species identification of members of the neisseriaceae and moraxellaceae. the inter- and intrageneric relationships were investigated using comparative sequence analysis of pcr-amplified partial 16s and 23s rdnas from a total of 94 strains. when compared to the type species of the genera acinetobacter, moraxella, and neisseria, an average of 30 polymorphic positions was observed within the partial 16s rdna investigated (corresponding to escherichia coli positions 54 to 510) for each species and an average of 11 polymorphic positions was observed within the 202 nucleotides of the 23s rdna gene (positions 1400 to 1600). neisseria macacae and neisseria mucosa subsp. mucosa (atcc 19696) had identical 16s and 23s rdna sequences. species clusters were heterogeneous in both genes in the case of acinetobacter lwoffii, moraxella  lacunata, and n. mucosa. neisseria meningitidis isolates failed to cluster only in the 23s rdna subset. our data showed that the 16s rdna region is more suitable than the partial 23s rdna for the molecular diagnosis of neisseriaceae and moraxellaceae and that a reference database should include more than one strain of each species. all sequence chromatograms and taxonomic and disease-related information are available as part of our ribosomal differentiation of medical microorganisms (ridom) web-based service (http://www.ridom.hygiene.uni-wuerzburg.de/). users can submit a sequence and conduct a similarity search against the ridom reference database for microbial identification purposes.

TI  == comparative in vitro studies on the beta-lactamase-inhibiting effect of clavulanic acid and sulbactam on ampicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == clavulanic acid and sulbactam alone are ineffective against pseudomonas and enterococci. staphylococci and enterobacteriaceae are inhibited by high concentrations not attainable under clinical conditions. strains of acinetobacter, especially a. lwoffii are susceptible to clavulanic acid and highly susceptible to sulbactam. the ampicillin/sulbactam combination is superior to ampicillin/clavulanic acid against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp. and morganella morganii. the latter combination is superior against klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. antagonistic effects are more frequent with the clavulanic  acid combination (enterobacter spp. and c. freundii) but are rarely observed with the sulbactam combination (providencia spp. and p. rettgeri).

AB  == the amikacin resistance gene acc(6')-ig of acinetobacter haemolyticus bm2685 encoding an aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferase was characterized. the gene was identified as a coding sequence of 438 bp corresponding to a protein with a calculated mass of 16,522 da. analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence suggested that it was the fourth member of a subfamily of aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferases. the resistance gene was not transferable either by conjugation to escherichia coli or to acinetobacter baumannii or by transformation into acinetobacter calcoaceticus. plasmid dna from strain bm2685 did not hybridize with an intragenic aac(6')-ig probe. these results suggest a chromosomal location for this gene. the gene was detected by dna hybridization in all 20 strains of a. haemolyticus tested but not in 179 other acinetobacter strains, including a. baumannii, a. lwoffii, a. junii, and a. johnsonii and genospecies 3, 6, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, of which 162 were amikacin resistant. the probe did not hybridize in dot blot assays with dnas purified from members of the families enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae that encode 6'-n-acetyltransferases. these data suggest that the aac(6')-ig gene is species specific and may be used to identify a. haemolyticus.

TI  == esterase from the oil-degrading acinetobacter lwoffii rag-1: sequence analysis and over-expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == the est gene encoding an esterase from acinetobacter lwoffii rag-1 was cloned into e. coli under the control of the pl promoter of the phage lambda. the n-terminal sequence of the first 20 amino acids of the heterologous expressed esterase corresponded to that obtained from the nucleotide sequence. antibodies prepared against the over-expressed recombinant esterase in e. coli were used to  locate the enzyme primarily in the membrane fractions of a. lwoffii rag-1. comparison with homologous proteins from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms suggest that the rag-1 esterase exhibits sequence motifs characteristic of both serine proteases and of lipases.

TI  == isolation, characterization, and sequence analysis of cryptic plasmids from acinetobacter calcoaceticus and their use in the construction of escherichia coli shuttle plasmids.
AB  == three cryptic plasmids have been discovered in acinetobacter calcoaceticus bd413. these three plasmids, designated pwm10 (7.4 kb), pwm11 (2.4 kb), and pwm12 (2.2 kb), exhibited extensive homology to one another, as shown by southern blot hybridization and restriction site analysis data, and also hybridized with three  plasmids having slightly different sizes detected in a second strain, a. calcoaceticus bd4. plasmid pwm11 and a fragment of pwm10 were each subcloned into puc19, yielding plasmids pwm4 and pwm6, respectively, and were used in a series of inter- and intraspecies transformation experiments. both plasmids replicated as high-copy-number plasmids in a. calcoaceticus bd413, as well as in strains of  escherichia coli. however, when transformed into the oil-degrading strain acinetobacter lwoffii rag-1, both plasmids were maintained at low copy numbers. no modification of the plasmids was detected after repeated transfers between hosts. an analysis of a series of deletions demonstrated that (i) a 185-bp fragment of pwm11 was sufficient to permit replication of the shuttle plasmid in  a. calcoaceticus bd413, (ii) the efficiency of transformation of a. calcoaceticus bd413 decreased according to the size of the deletion in the insert by up to 4 orders of magnitude, and (iii) the entire insert was required for transformation  and replication in a. lwoffii rag-1. the sequence of pwm11 contained several small (150- to 300-bp) open reading frames, none of which exhibited any homology  to known dna or protein sequences. in addition, a number of inverted and direct repeats, as well as six copies of the consensus sequence aaaaaaata previously described for a cryptic plasmid from a. lwoffii (m. hunger, r. schmucker, v. kishan, and w. hillen, gene 87:45-51, 1990), were detected. cloning and expression of the alcohol dehydrogenase regulon from a. lwoffii rag-1 were accomplished by using the acinetobacter shuttle plasmid.

TI  == transferable amikacin resistance in acinetobacter spp. due to a new type of 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii bm2580 resistant to kanamycin and structurally related antibiotics, including amikacin, was isolated from a clinical specimen. a phosphocellulose paper-binding assay and dna annealing studies indicated that resistance to aminoglycosides in bm2580 was due to synthesis of a new type of 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase. the gene conferring resistance to kanamycin-amikacin in this strain was carried by a 63-kilobase plasmid, pip1841,  self-transferable to a. baumannii, a. haemolyticus, and a. lwoffii but not to escherichia coli. the aminoglycoside resistance gene of pip1841 was cloned in e.  coli, where it was expressed.

TI  == late intraphagosomal hydrogen ion concentration favors the in vitro antimicrobial capacity of a 37-kilodalton cationic granule protein of human neutrophil granulocytes.
AB  == we described previously (w.m. shafer, l.e. martin, and j.k. spitznagel, infect. immun. 45:29-35, 1984) the presence of a 37-kilodalton cationic antimicrobial protein (37k cap) in extracts of granules prepared from human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (pmn). in this investigation, we prepared 37k cap from pmn granule extracts by sequential ion-exchange and molecular-sieve chromatography and examined its antimicrobial activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. at concentrations of 5 micrograms/ml or lower, 37k cap exerted selective antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria. these bacteria included acinetobacter lwoffii, escherichia coli, neisseria gonorrhoeae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, salmonella typhi, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella sonnei. however, at 5 micrograms of 37k cap per ml, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens resisted this antimicrobial activity. the bactericidal activity of 37k cap was greatest in acidic (ph 5.5) as opposed to alkaline (ph 7.5) media. the level of s. typhimurium resistance to 37k cap correlated with the presence of o antigen in the lipopolysaccharide. in the absence of o antigen repeat units, resistance was  proportional to the length of the core oligosaccharide. these results suggest that 37k cap may contribute significantly to the ability of pmn to kill gram-negative bacteria by nonoxidative means, particularly as the maturing phagolysosome becomes acidified.

TI  == [acinetobacter calcoaceticus strain with a wide spectrum of utilizing aromatic compounds and carrying a plasmid for resorcin degradation].
AB  == a bacterial strain was isolated from soil and identified as acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. lwoffii. the strain can utilize a wide spectrum of aromatic compounds. it carries a transmissive plasmid pbsw13 which determines resorcin utilization via the ortho pathway including the following steps: resorcin-hydroxyhydroquinone-maleylacetate-beta-ketoadipi c acid. the plasmid has been transferred by conjugation into the recipient strains of a. calcoaceticus 5734 ccm rifr, escherichia coli j-53 met-pro-rifr and klebsiella sp. plasmid dna  with a molecular mass close to that of phage gamma was detected by electrophoresis in the donor and recombinant strains. the degradation of other substrates is not a phenotypic expression of the genes of this plasmid.

TI  == evolutionary implications of features of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the  genus acinetobacter.
AB  == key enzymes of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis were examined in the genus acinetobacter. members of this genus belong to a suprafamilial assemblage of gram-negative bacteria (denoted superfamily b) for which a phylogenetic tree based upon oligonucleotide cataloging of 16s rrna exists. since the acinetobacter lineage diverged at an early evolutionary time from other lineages within superfamily b, an examination of aromatic biosynthesis in members of this genus has supplied important clues for the deduction of major evolutionary events leading to the contemporary aromatic pathways that now exist within superfamily b. together with escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas campestris, four well-spaced lineages have now been studied in comprehensive detail with respect to comparative enzymological features of aromatic amino acid  biosynthesis. a. calcoaceticus and a. lwoffii both possess two chorismate mutase  isozymes: one a monofunctional isozyme (chorismate mutase-f), and the other (chorismate mutase-p) a component of a bifunctional p-protein (chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase). while both p-protein activities were feedback inhibited by l-phenylalanine, the chorismate mutase-p activity was additionally inhibited by prephenate. likewise, chorismate mutase-f was product inhibited by prephenate. two isozymes of 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase  were detected. the major isozyme (greater than 95%) was sensitive to feedback inhibition by l-tyrosine, whereas the minor isozyme was apparently insensitive to allosteric control. prephenate dehydrogenase and arogenate dehydrogenase activities were both detected, but could not be chromatographically resolved. available evidence favors the existence of a single dehydrogenase enzyme, exhibiting substrate ambiguity for prephenate and l-arogenate.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacterial flora of clinically normal conjunctivae in the domestic duckling.
AB  == a total of 100 eyes from newly hatched and young domestic ducklings were swabbed  and the bacterial flora determined by standard bacteriological culture methods. of the total number of bacteria isolated, 57% were gram negative suggesting that  the majority were derived from the intestinal flora. only 2% of the eyes sampled  showed no bacterial growth. the bacterial species most commonly cultured were escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinetobacter anitratus, klebsiella pneumoniae, non-haemolytic streptococci, micrococcus spp., a-haemolytic streptococci and acinetobacter lwoffii. more than one bacterial species was found in the majority of eyes. a. anitratus was isolated almost exclusively from 1 day  old ducklings while a. lwoffii was mainly isolated from pen-reared ducklings. chlamydia psittaci was not isolated from any of the conjunctivae sampled.
