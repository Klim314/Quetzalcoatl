TI  == assessing the oral microbiota of healthy and alcohol-treated rats using whole-genome dna probes from human bacteria.
AB  == objective: this study aimed to evaluate the capacity of whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria to cross-react with bacteria from the oral cavity of rats, and to assess the influence of alcohol ingestion on the animals'  oral biofilm. design: twenty four mature wistar rats were equally divided in two  groups. one group (control) was fed balanced diet of rat pellets and water. the alcohol-treated group (at) received the same diet and 20% ethanol solution. upon  euthanasia after 30 days, bacterial samples from the oral biofilm covering the animals' teeth were collected using microbrushes. bacteria identification and quantification were performed using the dna checkerboard hybridization method with 33 probes prepared from human oral bacteria. signals corresponding to bacterial genome counts and percentages were compared using a mann-whitney u test with a significance level <0.05. results: cross-reaction for all targeted species, except streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis-like species, occurred in the control group. escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, porphyromonas endodontalis, and veillonella parvula-like species only produced detectable signals in the at group. significantly more signals were detected in the control group compared to the at group (p=0.001). the percentage of e. coli-like species was highest in both groups. conclusions: whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria can cross-react with rats' oral bacterial species. alcohol consumption is associated with lower levels and diversity of bacterial species in the oral cavity of rats.

TI  == electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium grade 2 and ti6al4v alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  == bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  the aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure grade 2 ti and ti grade 5 (ti6al4v) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. ti grade 2 and ti grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130v for pure titanium; 100 and 120v for ti6al4v alloy. surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) equipped with eds probe, laser profilometry and x-ray diffractometry. bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. the higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130v) and ti6al4v alloy (120v) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and ti6al4v and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. in contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote  osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. the observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == production of monoclonal antibody inhibiting dipeptidylaminopeptidase iv activity of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species implicated as an important pathogen in the development of adult periodontitis. we previously cloned a gene encoding dipeptydilaminopeptidase iv (dapiv) from p. gingivalis. in the present study, for immunological diagnosis and development of  passive immunization, we produced a mouse monoclonal antibody (mab) capable of inhibiting the dapiv activity of p. gingivalis using highly purified recombinant  dapiv as an immunogen. the constructed mab, designated as mab-pg-dap-1, significantly inhibited dapiv activity in p. gingivalis, as well as slightly inhibited that in other gram-negative bacteria such as porphyromonas endodontalis and prevotella loesheii, whereas no inhibition was seen in the gram-positive bacteria streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus. furthermore, the mab did  not inhibit dapiv enzyme activity in human serum. this novel mab may be useful for the development of immunological diagnosis capability and in passive immunization.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == an optimal host response to a bacterium may require the interaction of leukocytes and resident host cells.
AB  == bacterial infection results in inflammatory responses that may lead to soft-tissue damage and bone resorption. however, the mechanisms by which different bacteria contribute to lesions of endodontic origin are not fully understood. this study examined the response to streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas endodontalis in two cell types that are involved in periapical pathology, mononuclear and osteoblastic cells. this was accomplished by measuring the induction of chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-2) and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma). the results demonstrated that s. mutans more efficiently stimulate inflammatory cytokine production by mononuclear cells, whereas p. endodontalis is relatively more potent in activating osteoblastic cells. moreover, optimal activation of osteoblastic cells by s. mutans requires soluble mediators produced by mononuclear cells, whereas p. endodontalis does not. these results suggest that the association of different bacteria with specific pathologic processes may be partially explained by their capacities to activate specific host cells.

TI  == t lymphocyte subpopulations and interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-4 in rat pulpitis experimentally induced by specific bacteria.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the expression of surface markers  on t lymphocytes and the th1/th2 immune response in pulpal inflammation associated with specific bacteria. pulpal inflammation was experimentally induced in rat mandibular incisors by drilling, without coolant, to open pulp chambers. streptococcus mutans (s. mutans group), porphyromonas endodontalis (p. endodontalis group), and a sterile cotton pellet only (control group) were inoculated in the canal. the expression of cd25 and cd54 on cd4+, and cd8+ lymphocytes in pulp tissues was determined by using a flow cytometer. the levels  of interleukin (il)-2, interferon (ifn)-gamma, and il-4 were measured by elisa. flow-cytometric analysis showed that the mean ratio of cd4+:cd8+ was 0.96 in the  control group, 0.99 in the s. mutans group, and 0.52 in the p. endodontalis group. an increase in cd25 and cd54 expression on cd4+ t lymphocytes was related  to the bacterial infection (p < 0.05) and accompanied an increase in il-2 concentration. the higher concentration of ifn-gamma than il-4 in the p. endodontalis group suggested a th1 reaction in the early stage of pulpal inflammation induced by p. endodontalis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic  pathogens. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of  four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (ah26, ah plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (n2), and one calcium hydroxide-based  sealer (sealapex). the testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. all the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial  activity. the sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types  and bacterial strains. n2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. the extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.

TI  == antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  == past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. the antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems single bond, prime&bond nt, and excite were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus intermedius, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella oris, prevotella bivia, prevotella denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and clostridium  ramosum with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. prime&bond nt showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to single bond, whereas ex produced no inhibitory effect on porphyromonas endodontalis, although  the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. the variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == bacterium-dependent induction of cytokines in mononuclear cells and their pathologic consequences in vivo.
AB  == viridans streptococci are a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria that are normal inhabitants of the mouth. these organisms are thought to contribute significantly to the etiology of infective endocarditis, although recently they have been implicated in serious infections in other settings. another group of oral bacteria, gram-negative anaerobes, is associated with chronic dental infections, such as periodontal diseases or endodontic lesion formation. we evaluated the ability of the oral pathogens streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas endodontalis to induce a pathogenic response in vivo, with the goal of quantifying the inflammatory response in soft tissue by measuring leukocyte recruitment and hard tissues by measuring osteoclastogenesis. s. mutans induced a strong inflammatory response and was a potent inducer of osteoclast formation, while p. endodontalis was not. to further study the mechanisms by which p. endodontalis and s. mutans elicit significantly different levels of inflammatory  responses in vivo, we tested the capacity of each to induce production of cytokines by mononuclear cells in vitro. s. mutans stimulated high levels of interleukin-12 (il-12), gamma interferon (ifn-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), all of which are associated with inflammation, enhanced monocyte function, and generation of a th1 response. in contrast, p. endodontalis stimulated production of il-10 but not of tnf-alpha, il-12, or ifn-gamma. these results demonstrate that oral pathogens differ dramatically in their abilities to induce inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines. moreover, there is a high degree of correlation between the cytokine profile induced by these bacteria in vitro and their pathogenic capacity in vivo.

TI  == endodontic pathogens stimulate monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-8 in mononuclear cells.
AB  == microbial infection of the dental pulp leads to the recruitment of leukocytes and the formation of lesions of endodontic origin. the chemokines interleukin-8 (il-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. in the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated by streptococcus mutants, porphyromonas endodontalis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which are associated with lesions of endodontic origin. each of these bacteria induced a dose-dependent increase in il-8 and mcp-1, determined by elisa. the levels induced are physiologically relevant. however, low doses of p. endodontalis were  less effective in inducing il-8 or mcp-1 expression, compared with s. mutants or  p. anaerobius. thus, these bacteria can induce significant levels of the chemokines il-8 and mcp-1, which could contribute to the recruitment of neutrophils or monocytes in vivo. the expression of these mediators may contribute to the development of endodontic infections, particularly with regard  to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.
