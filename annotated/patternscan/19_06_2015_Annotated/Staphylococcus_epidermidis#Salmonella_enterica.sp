TI  == antimicrobial activities of active component isolated from lawsonia inermis leaves and structure-activity relationships of its analogues against food-borne bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of lawsonia inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues against food-borne bacteria. the antimicrobial activities of five fractions derived from the methanol extract of lawsonia inermis leaves were evaluated against 7 food-borne bacteria. 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was isolated by chromatographic analyses. 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone showed the strong activities against bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus epidermidis, and s. intermedius, but exerted no growth-inhibitory  activities against s. typhimurium. the antimicrobial activities of the 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues were tested against 7 food-borne bacteria  to establish structure-activity relationships. hydroxyl (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), methoxy (2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), and methyl (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, and 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) functional groups on the 1,4-naphthoquinone skeleton possessed potent activities, whereas bromo (2-bromo-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2,3-dibromo-1,4-naphthoquione) and chloro (2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone) exhibited no activity against 7 food-borne bacteria. the l. inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues  should be useful as natural antimicrobial agents against food-borne bacteria.

TI  == in-vitro screening of malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial  activity of malaysian honey is still limited. in this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of malaysian monofloral honey from koompassia excelsa (becc.) taub (tualang), melaleuca cajuputi powell (gelam) and durio zibethinus murr. (durian). honey samples were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc6518  and atcc25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc12228, enterococcus faecium lmg16192, enterococcus faecalis lmg16216 and atcc29212, escherichia coli atcc25922, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc14028 and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc13883. results: marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas tualang and gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). conclusion: present findings suggested gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested malaysian honey samples.

TI  == monotreme lactation protein is highly expressed in monotreme milk and provides antimicrobial protection.
AB  == monotremes (platypus and echidna) are the descendants of the oldest ancestor of all extant mammals distinguished from other mammals by mode of reproduction. monotremes lay eggs following a short gestation period and after an even briefer  incubation period, altricial hatchlings are nourished over a long lactation period with milk secreted by nipple-less mammary patches located on the female's  abdomen. milk is the sole source of nutrition and immune protection for the developing young until weaning. using transcriptome and mass spectrometry analysis of milk cells and milk proteins, respectively, a novel monotreme lactation protein (mlp) was identified as a major secreted protein in milk. we show that platypus and short-beaked echidna mlp genes show significant homology and are unique to monotremes. the mlp transcript was shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues; however, highest expression was observed in milk cells and was expressed constitutively from early to late lactation. analysis of recombinant mlp showed that it is an n-linked glycosylated protein and biophysical studies predicted that mlp is an amphipathic, alpha-helical protein,  a typical feature of antimicrobial proteins. functional analysis revealed mlp antibacterial activity against both opportunistic pathogenic staphylococcus aureus and commensal enterococcus faecalis bacteria but showed no effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and salmonella enterica. our data suggest that mlp is an evolutionarily ancient component of milk-mediated innate immunity absent in other mammals. we propose that mlp evolved specifically in the monotreme lineage supporting the evolution of lactation in these species to provide bacterial protection, at a time when mammals lacked nipples.

TI  == a comparison of conventional methods for the quantification of bacterial cells after exposure to metal oxide nanoparticles.
AB  == background: due to potential interference of nanoparticles on bacterial quantification, there is a challenge to develop a fast, accurate and reproducible method for bacterial quantification. currently various bacterial quantification methods are used by researchers performing nanoparticles study, but there has been no efficacy evaluation of these methods. here we study interference of nanoparticles on three most commonly used conventional bacterial quantification methods, including colony counting to determine the colony-forming units (cfu), spectrophotometer method of optical density (od) measurement, and flow cytometry  (fcm). results: three oxide nanoparticles including zno, tio2, and sio2 and four  bacterial species including salmonella enterica serovar newport, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and escherichia coli were included in the test. results showed that there is no apparent interference of the oxide nanoparticles on quantifications of all four bacterial species by fcm measurement; cfu counting is time consuming, less accurate and not suitable for automation; and the spectrophotometer method using od measurement was the most unreliable method to quantify and detect the bacteria in the presence of the nanoparticles. conclusion: in summary, fcm measurement proved to be the best method, which is suitable for rapid, accurate and automatic detection of bacteria in the presence of the nanoparticles.

TI  == identification of an amyloidogenic peptide from the bap protein of staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == biofilm associated proteins (bap) are involved in the biofilm formation process of several bacterial species. the sequence stvtvt is present in bap proteins expressed by many staphylococcus species, acinetobacter baumanii and salmonella enterica. the peptide stvtvtf derived from the c-repeat of the bap protein from staphylococcus epidermidis was selected through the aggrescan, pasta, and tango software prediction of protein aggregation and formation of amyloid fibers. we characterized the self-assembly properties of the peptide stvtvtf by different methods: in the presence of the peptide, we observed an increase in the fluorescence intensity of thioflavin t; many intermolecular beta-sheets and fibers were spontaneously formed in peptide preparations as observed by infrared  spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy analyses. in conclusion, a 7 amino acids peptide derived from the c-repeat of the bap protein was sufficient for the spontaneous formation of amyloid fibers. the possible involvement of this amyloidogenic sequence in protein-protein interactions is discussed.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == internalisation potential of escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus in lettuce seedlings and mature plants.
AB  == the internalisation potential of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium in lettuce was evaluated using seedlings grown in vermiculite in seedling trays as well as hydroponically grown lettuce. sterile distilled water was spiked with one of the four human pathogenic bacteria (10(5) cfu/ml) and used to irrigate the plants. the potential for pathogen internalisation was investigated over time using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and viable plate counts. additionally, the identities of the pathogens isolated from internal lettuce plant tissues were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction with pathogen-specific oligonucleotides. internalisation of each of the  human pathogens was evident in both lettuce seedlings and hydroponically grown mature lettuce plants. to our knowledge, this is the first report of s. aureus internalisation in lettuce plants. in addition, the levels of background microflora in the lettuce plants were determined by plate counting and the isolates identified using matrix-assisted laser ionisation-time of flight (maldi-tof). background microflora assessments confirmed the absence of the four  pathogens evaluated in this study. a low titre of previously described endophytes and soil inhabitants, i.e., enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, lysinibacillus fusiformis, rhodococcus rhodochrous, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis were identified.

TI  == detection and differentiation of foodborne pathogenic bacteria in mung bean sprouts using field deployable label-free sers devices.
AB  == vancomycin functionalized silver nanorod arrays substrates were used to obtain the surface enhanced raman scattering (sers) signals of six foodborne pathogenic  bacteria in mung bean sprouts samples using both a portable and a handheld raman  system. the silver nanorod arrays substrates were optimized to facilitate quantitative, rapid, and sensitive detection of salmonella enterica serotype anatum, salmonella enterica serotype cubana, salmonella enterica serotype stanley, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli o157:h7, and staphylococcus epidermidis. substrate optimization was achieved by varying the nanorod length and vancomycin incubation concentration. by combining these substrates with a two-step filtration process we found that the foodborne pathogenic bacteria used  in this study can be identified in mung bean sprouts with a limit of detection as low as 100 cfu ml(-1) in less than 4 h using both portable and handheld raman systems. the results show that sers spectra can be used to differentiate between  bacterial species and serotypes when chemometric methods are employed. the low detection limit and rapid detection time of this biosensing platform for foodborne pathogenic bacteria could be a valuable field detection method for the  fresh produce and food processing industries.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == a novel synthetic peptide from a tomato defensin exhibits antibacterial activities against helicobacter pylori.
AB  == defensins are a class of cysteine-rich proteins, which exert broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this work, we used a bioinformatic approach to identify putative defensins in the tomato genome. fifteen proteins had a mature peptide that includes the well-conserved tetradisulfide array. we selected a representative member of the tomato defensin family; we chemically synthesized its gamma-motif and tested its antimicrobial activity. here, we demonstrate that  the synthetic peptide exhibits potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus a170, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi, escherichia coli, and helicobacter pylori. in addition, the synthetic peptide shows minimal (<5%) hemolytic activity and absence of cytotoxic effects against thp-1 cells. finally, solyc exerts an anti-inflammatory activity in vitro, as it downregulates the level of the proinflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma.

TI  == comparison of real-time pcr and masstag pcr for the multiplex detection of highly pathogenic agents.
AB  == multiplex pcr assays are a cost- as well as labour-effective way to analyse one sample for several pathogens simultaneously. besides the mutual competition of the individual pcr reactions included in a multiplex pcr assay, their specific read-out displays a limiting factor for the total number of pcr reactions that can be multiplexed. in this study, two pcr systems with different read-out approaches are compared, using a pentaplex pcr assay for the detection of highly  pathogenic agents. a pentaplex assay was used since five represents the current limit of real-time pcr multiplexing capacity due to the low resolution of fluorescence emission peaks of the current equipment. in contrast, masstag pcr as a quite new technique offers the possibility to detect up to 20-30 target sequences from one reaction. after extensive and separate optimisation of the pcr protocol for both platforms, a comparative probit analysis showed good sensitivities for masstag and real-time pcr detection. nevertheless, the detection limits of masstag pcr have been undercut by the real-time pcr for each  target. we therefore conclude that masstag pcr is a useful diagnostic technique for the sensitive screening for pathogens by highly multiplexed pcr assays, but cannot reach the sensitivity of real-time pcr for lower multiplexed pcr assays.

TI  == activation of type iii interferon genes by pathogenic bacteria in infected epithelial cells and mouse placenta.
AB  == bacterial infections trigger the expression of type i and ii interferon genes but little is known about their effect on type iii interferon (ifn-lambda) genes, whose products play important roles in epithelial innate immunity against viruses. here, we studied the expression of ifn-lambda genes in cultured human epithelial cells infected with different pathogenic bacteria and in the mouse placenta infected with listeria monocytogenes. we first showed that in intestinal lovo cells, induction of ifn-lambda genes by l. monocytogenes required bacterial  entry and increased further during the bacterial intracellular phase of infection. other gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis, also induced ifn-lambda genes when internalized by lovo cells. in contrast, gram-negative bacteria salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, shigella flexneri and chlamydia trachomatis did not substantially induce ifn-lambda. we also found that ifn-lambda genes were up-regulated in a549 lung epithelial cells infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and in hepg2 hepatocytes and bewo trophoblastic cells infected with  l. monocytogenes. in a humanized mouse line permissive to fetoplacental listeriosis, ifn-lambda2/lambda3 mrna levels were enhanced in placentas infected  with l. monocytogenes. in addition, the feto-placental tissue was responsive to ifn-lambda2. together, these results suggest that ifn-lambda may be an important  modulator of the immune response to gram-positive intracellular bacteria in epithelial tissues.

TI  == igg opsonization of bacteria promotes th17 responses via synergy between tlrs and fcgammariia in human dendritic cells.
AB  == dendritic cells (dcs) are essential in inducing adaptive immune responses against bacteria by expressing cytokines that skew t-cell responses toward protective th17 cells. although it is widely recognized that induction of these cytokines by dcs involves activation of multiple receptors, it is still incompletely characterized which combination of receptors specifically skews th17-cell responses. here we have identified a novel role for fcgammariia in promoting human th17 cells. activation of dcs by bacteria opsonized by serum igg strongly promoted th17 responses, which was fcgammariia-dependent and coincided with enhanced production of selected cytokines by dcs, including th17-promoting il-1beta and il-23. notably, fcgammariia stimulation on dcs did not induce cytokine production when stimulated individually, but selectively amplified cytokine responses through synergy with tlr2, 4, or 5. importantly, this synergy  is mediated at 2 different levels. first, tlr-fcgammariia costimulation strongly  increased transcription of pro-il-1beta and il-23p19. second, fcgammariia triggering induced activation of caspase-1, which cleaves pro-il-1beta into its bioactive form and thereby enhanced il-1beta secretion. taken together, these data identified cross-talk between tlrs and fcgammariia as a novel mechanism by which dcs promote protective effector th17-cell responses against bacteria.

TI  == prokaryotic selectivity and lps-neutralizing activity of short antimicrobial peptides designed from the human antimicrobial peptide ll-37.
AB  == to develop novel antimicrobial peptides (amps) with shorter lengths, improved prokaryotic selectivity and retained lipolysaccharide (lps)-neutralizing activity compared to human cathelicidin amp, ll-37, a series of amino acid-substituted analogs based on ig-19 (residues 13-31 of ll-37) were synthesized. among the ig-19 analogs, the analog a4 showed the highest prokaryotic selectivity, but much lower lps-neutralizing activity compared to parental ll-37. the analogs, a5, a6,  a7 and a8 with higher hydrophobicity displayed lps-neutralizing activity comparable to that of ll-37, but much lesser prokaryotic selectivity. these results indicate that the proper hydrophobicity of the peptides is crucial to exert the amalgamated property of lps-neutralizing activity and prokaryotic selectivity. furthermore, to increase lps-neutralizing activity of the analog a4  without a remarkable decrease in prokaryotic selectivity, we synthesized trp-substituted analogs (a4-w1 and a4-w2), in which phe(5) or phe(15) of a4 is replaced by trp. despite their same prokaryotic selectivity, a4-w2 displayed much higher lps-neutralizing activity compared to a4-w1. when compared with parental ll-37, a4-w2 showed retained lps-neutralizing activity and 2.8-fold enhanced prokaryotic selectivity. these results suggest that the effective site for trp-substitution when designing novel amps with higher lps-neutralizing activity, without a remarkable reduction in prokaryotic selectivity, is the amphipathic interface between the end of the hydrophilic side and the start of the hydrophobic side rather than the central position of the hydrophobic side in their alpha-helical wheel projection. taken together, the analog a4-w2 can serve  as a promising template for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of endotoxic shock and bacterial infection.

TI  == antibacterial activity in spices and local medicinal plants against clinical isolates of karachi, pakistan.
AB  == context: development of resistance in human pathogens against conventional antibiotic necessitates searching indigenous medicinal plants having antibacterial property. twenty-seven medicinal plants used actively in folklore,  ayurvedic and traditional system of medicine were selected for the evaluation of  their antimicrobial activity for this study. eleven plants chosen from these 27 are used as spices in local cuisine. objective: evaluation of the effectiveness of some medicinal plant extracts against clinical isolates. material and methods: nonedible plant parts were extracted with methanol and evaporated in vacuo to obtain residue. powdered edible parts were boiled three times and cooled in sterile distilled water for 2 min each and filtrate collected. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of plant extracts and filtrates/antibiotics was evaluated against clinical isolates by microbroth dilution method. results: water extract of syzygium aromaticum l. (myrtaceae) buds, methanol extracts of ficus carica l. (moraceae) and olea europaea l. (oleaceae) leaves and peganum harmala l. (nitrariaceae) seeds had mic ranges of 31.25-250 microg/ml. s. aromaticum inhibited growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa. f. carica and o. europaea inhibited growth of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. pyogenes whereas p. harmala was effective against s. aureus,  acinetobacter calcoaceticus and candida albicans. ampicillin, velosef, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, which are used as control, had mic >/= 50 and 1.5 microg/ml, respectively, for organisms sensitive to extracts. discussion and conclusion: mono/multiextract from identified plants will provide an array of safe antimicrobial agents to control infections by drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == the in vitro anti-pathogenic activity of immunoglobulin concentrates extracted from ovine blood.
AB  == an immunoglobulin-rich fraction has been prepared from ovine blood in our laboratory. we have investigated its antibacterial activity and binding activity  to pathogenic whole cell antigens, lipopolysaccharide (lps) and staphylococcal enterotoxin b. ovine immunoglobulin concentrate (oic) comprised about 73 +/- 2% of igg and 11 +/- 1% of igm on a protein basis. it inhibited the growth of all 13 strains of pathogens tested, but the inhibitory activity varied according to bacterial strain. the inhibitory activity of oic was attributed to the high contents of undenatured immunoglobulin present because its inhibitory activity was destroyed by pepsin digestion and heat treatment (65 degrees c for 30 min). oic bound to all the gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, regardless of cell wall structure. the highest magnitude of crossreactivity to whole cell antigens was against staphylococcus epidermidis and shigella soneii strains (p <  0.001). the binding activity of oic to lps obtained from escherichia coli o111:b4 and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and lymphoblast k-562 proliferation assay. oic bound to lps with a binding activity that was dependent on oic concentration and saturable, showing typical hyperbolic curves. for toxin-binding activity, an oic concentration-dependent trend like that for lps-binding activity was also observed. this preliminary evidence suggests that the oic used in this study could be a promising supplement for protecting against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == silver nanorod arrays as a surface-enhanced raman scattering substrate for foodborne pathogenic bacteria detection.
AB  == surface-enhanced raman scattering (sers) using novel silver nanorod array substrates has been used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. the substrate  consists of a base layer of 500 nm silver film on a glass slide and a layer of silver nanorod array with a length of approximately 1 microm produced by the oblique angle deposition method at a vapor incident angle of 86 degrees . spectra from whole cell bacteria, generic escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, e. coli dh 5alpha, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and salmonella typhimurium, and bacteria mixtures have been obtained. this sers active substrate can detect spectral differences between gram types, different species, their mixture, and strains. principal component analysis (pca) has been applied to classify the spectra. viable and nonviable cells have also been examined, and significantly reduced sers responses were observed for nonviable cells. sers detection of bacteria at the single cell level, excited at low incident laser power (12 micro  w) and short collection time (10 s), has also been demonstrated. these results indicate that the sers-active silver nanorod array substrate is a potential analytical sensor for rapid identification of microorganisms with a minimum of sample preparation.

AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == a functional homing endonuclease in the bacillus anthracis nrde group i intron.
AB  == the essential bacillus anthracis nrde gene carries a self-splicing group i intron with a putative homing endonuclease belonging to the giy-yig family. here, we show that the nrde pre-mrna is spliced and that the homing endonuclease cleaves an intronless nrde gene 5 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' extensions. we also show that the sequence required for efficient cleavage spans at least 4 bp upstream and 31 bp downstream of the cleaved coding strand. the position of the recognition sequence in relation to the cleavage position is as expected for a giy-yig homing endonuclease. interestingly, nrde genes from several other bacillaceae were also susceptible to cleavage, with those of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis (nrde1), b. anthracis, and bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian being better substrates than those of bacillus subtilis, bacillus lichenformis, and s. epidermidis (nrde2). on the other hand, nrde genes from lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and corynebacterium ammoniagenes were not cleaved. intervening sequences (ivss) residing in protein-coding genes are often found in enzymes involved in dna metabolism, and the ribonucleotide reductase nrde gene is a frequent target for self-splicing ivss. a comparison of  nrde genes from seven gram-positive low-g+c bacteria, two bacteriophages, and nocardia farcinica showed five different insertion sites for self-splicing ivss within the coding region of the nrde gene.

AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == the product of the qacc gene of staphylococcus epidermidis ch mediates resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we have characterized a natural isolate of staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to heavy metals that carries a small 2391-bp plasmid, psepch, encoding the qacc gene. the s. epidermidis qacc gene confers resistance to a number of beta-lactam  antibiotics and to ethidium bromide in its natural host and in escherichia coli k12 and salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium. this is the first communication of a small multidrug resistance (smr) pump involved in resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. experiments using tolc, ompw and ompd mutant strains of s. typhimurium demonstrated that the beta-lactam antibiotic resistance conferred by  this pump does not depend on these outer membrane proteins.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == chlamydia pneumoniae binds to platelets and triggers p-selectin expression and aggregation: a causal role in cardiovascular disease?
AB  == objective: evidence linking chlamydia pneumoniae to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is expanding. platelets are considered to play an essential role in cardiovascular diseases; however, so far platelets have not been associated with an infectious cause of atherosclerosis. this study aims to clarify the interaction between c pneumoniae and platelets and possibly present a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. methods and results: the  effects of c pneumoniae on platelet aggregation and secretion were assessed with  lumiaggregometry, and the ability of c pneumoniae to bind to platelets and stimulate expression of p-selectin was analyzed with flow cytometry. we found that c pneumoniae, at a chlamydia:platelet ratio of 1:15, adheres to platelets and triggers p-selectin expression after 1 minute and causes an extensive aggregation and atp secretion after 20 minutes of incubation. inhibition of glycoprotein iib/iiia with arg-gly-asp-ser or abciximab markedly reduced c pneumoniae-induced platelet aggregation. exposure of c pneumoniae to polymyxin b, but not elevated temperature, abolished the stimulatory effects on platelet activation, suggesting that chlamydial lipopolysaccharide has an active role. in  contrast, other tested bacteria had no or only moderate effects on platelet functions. conclusions: our findings demonstrate a new concept of how c pneumoniae activates platelets and thereby may cause atherosclerosis and thrombotic vascular occlusion.

TI  == hypothalamic mechanisms of immunity.
AB  == the present article considers a synthetical analysis of the results reported by our laboratory in the last twenty years in the field of neuroimmunomodulation. the studies we discuss here continue a previous research activity, a synthesis of which has also been published in this journal (baciu, 1988). in that paper, we reported data concerning the role of the hypothalamic tubero-mammillary area in triggering of the phagocytic and of the secondary immune specific response. here, we present an analysis of experimental facts gathered after 1988, and also of some prior to that date, which were not included in the above-mentioned review. they regard localizations, attained with stereotactical methods, of hypothalamic  areas involved in maintenance of basal phagocytosis and of its circadian rhythm,  of the phagocytic and of the primary and secondary specific response. we attempted to re-analyze these data in an integrative view, and accomplish a coherent image of the hypothalamic mechanisms of the nonspecific and specific immune response. the conclusion we draw is that the nervous system may exert its  modulatory action upon the immune response in several ways: i) subsequent to a direct hypothalamic stimulation (electrical or through bacteria or bacterial products) or to a cortico-hypothalamic stimulation; ii) depending on the nature,  intensity, duration, and frequency of the appropriate stimulus, it may either enhance the immune response, via neural and humoral pathways, or depress it; iii) via the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. nervous triggering and enhancement of the immune response are essential, their occurrence in the initial stages ensuring its favorable course. the finding that repeated electroconvulsant shocks, employed for hypothalamus stimulation in dogs of different breed, age, weight, and individual history, are followed by extremely variable changes of the phagocytic activity raises the question on the individuality of the immune response.

TI  == [effect of ozone on airborne microorganisms].
AB  == the microbicidal effect of ozone in air was tested at concentrations between 50 and 600 micrograms/m3 against the species: staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, arthrobacter citreus, bacillus subtilis (veg.), escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas fluorescens and candida albicans. the microorganisms were exposed on membrane filters at 60-75% relative humidity and 21.5-22.5 degrees c. after exposure times between 1 min and 60 min, the filters were incubated on appropriate agar media. the effect of ozone was determined by comparing the number of colonies on exposed filters to the number on nonexposed filters. the die-off curves (colony count against time) proved not to be rectilinear, but to become steeper with increasing time of exposure. furthermore, the velocity of reduction increased more than proportional with increasing concentration of ozone. therefore, the bacterial decay seems not  to follow first order reaction kinetics. the values presented for k (constant of  the velocity of die-off) and d (decimal reduction time) are valid only for narrow ranges of the initial part of the exposure. concentrations of 50 to 100 micrograms (0)3/m3 for 1 h resulted only in little reduction, whereas 500 to 600  micrograms/m3 for one hour led to 99% reduction in all bacterial species tested.  the gram-positive species seemed to be more sensitive than the gram-negative species, c. albicans proved to be more resistant than the bacteria.

TI  == effect of prestorage white cell reduction on bacterial growth in platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates stored with and without autologous white cells were produced from units of whole blood that had been purposefully contaminated with bacteria immediately after phlebotomy. the blood was inoculated with one of five  species of bacterium at either 10 or 50 colony-forming units per ml. the growth of the organisms was quantified throughout the conventional 5-day, 22 degrees c storage period of the platelet concentrates. one species, klebsiella pneumoniae,  failed to grow in any of the components. the remaining species, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and salmonella enteritidis, achieved log growth after 1 day of storage and reached a relative maximum concentration by day 3. although the concentration of bacteria immediately after  inoculation was lower in the units reduced in white cells by filtration, no significant differences were observed thereafter. data from this in vitro study support the concept that prestorage white cell reduction of platelet concentrates should not increase the likelihood of transfusion-induced septicemia.

AB  == rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. staphylococcus aureus (209p, cowan i, smith diffuse and smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, micrococcus lysodeikticus and bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. gram-negative bacteria,  such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and k) and klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid,  277, and 8n3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (lps) of salmonella typhimurium lt2, such as ra, rc, rd, and re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. lysozyme did  not show any bactericidal activity except against m. lysodeikticus and b. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against s. typhimurium and s. aureus. with regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, np1, np4, and np5, np1 showed strong bactericidal activity against k. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. neither  np4 nor np5 showed any bactericidal activity, while np5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of np1 against k. pneumoniae 277.

TI  == sensitivity of bacteria to nano2 and to l-arginine-dependent system in murine macrophages.
AB  == sensitivity of bacteria to no2-/no and to l-arginine-dependent system in murine macrophages was tested. the growth of all bacteria tested, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis, was significantly inhibited by nano2 at the concentration of 5 to 10 mm. however, l-arginine-dependent effector mechanism of lps-activated murine macrophages was ineffective in killing these bacteria. it seems that the concentration of no2-/no in phagolysosome in the activated macrophages is insufficient to kill the bacteria in situ. we concluded that l-arginine-dependent effector mechanism can hardly work on bacteria killing in activated macrophages.

TI  == mechanisms of zidovudine resistance in bacteria.
AB  == unlike their parent strains, zidovudine-resistant derivatives of escherichia coli kl16 and salmonella typhimurium nctc 5710 were found to be incapable of incorporating radiolabelled thymidine into their chromosomal dna. since incorporation was still prevented in the presence of edta, resistance to zidovudine was not associated with a permeability barrier, but appeared to result from the loss of thymidine kinase activity, required for the phosphorylation of zidovudine. pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is intrinsically zidovudine-resistant,  was also shown to be incapable of incorporating thymidine into its dna, but staphylococcus epidermidis sk360 and staph. aureus e3t, which are also intrinsically zidovudine-resistant, possessed thymidine kinase activity. this suggests that two distinct mechanisms of resistance to zidovudine exist in bacteria. zidovudine resistance did not appear to confer resistance to other antibacterial agents.

AB  == cell surface charge and hydrophobicity of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were determined by hydrocarbon adherence, hydrophobic interaction, and electrostatic interaction chromatography. surface charge and hydrophobicity were compared with the initial  attachment values and rates of attachment of the bacteria to meat surfaces. there was a linear correlation between the relative negative charge on the bacterial cell surface and initial attachment to lean beef muscle (r2 = 0.885) and fat tissue (r2 = 0.777). hydrophobicity correlated well with attachment to fat tissue only. the relative hydrophobicity of each bacterium was dependent on the specific method of determination, with wide variations noted between methods.

TI  == killing of gram-negative bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes: role of an o2-independent bactericidal system.
AB  == previous studies have suggested that a cationic bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi) present in both rabbit and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes is the principal o2-independent bactericidal agent of these cells toward several strains of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium (1978. j. biol. chem. 253: 2664--2672; 1979. j. biol. chem. 254: 11000--11009). to further evaluate the possible role of this protein in the killing of gram-negative bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, we have measured the bactericidal activity of intact rabbit peritoneal exudate leukocytes under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and of intact human leukocytes from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease. anaerobic conditions were created by  flushing the cells under a nitrogen stream. effective removal of oxygen was demonstrated by the inability of nitrogen-flushed leukocytes to mount a respiratory burst (measured as increased conversion of 1-[14c]glucose leads to 14co2 or by superoxide production) during bacterial ingestion. at a bacteria/leukocyte ratio of 10:1, killing of gram-positive, bpi-resistant, staphylococcus epidermidis is markedly impaired in the absence of oxygen (76.4 +/- 3.3% killing in room air, 29.2 +/- 8.2% killing in nitrogen). essentially all increased bacterial survival is intracellular. in contrast, both a nonopsonized rough strain (mr-10) and an opsonized smooth strain (ms) of s. typhimurium 395 are killed equally well in room air and nitrogen. a maximum of 70--80 mr-10 and 30--40 ms are killed per leukocyte either in the presence or absence of oxygen. there is no intracellular bacterial survival in either condition indicating that  intracellular o2-independent bactericidal system(s) of rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes can at least match the leukocyte's ingestive capacity. whole homogenates and crude acid extracts manifest similar bactericidal capacity toward s. typhimurium 395. this activity can be accounted for by the bpi content of these cell fractions and is virtually eliminated by immune (anti-bpi), but not by preimmune goat igg-rich fractions. opsonization of smooth ms, required for bacterial killing by intact leukocytes, does not alter bacterial sensitivity to bpi in crude or purified form. leukocytes of a patient with chronic granulomatous disease killed ingested s. typhimurium 396 ms nearly as well as did normal leukocytes. the bactericidal activity toward e. coli (j5) of crude acid extracts  of the cgd and normal human leukocytes was virtually the same and was nearly completely inhibited by anti-bpi igg-rich fractions, but not by preimmune igg-rich fractions. these findings suggest that the killing of gram-negative bacteria such as s. typhimurium by intact polymorphonuclear leukocytes may also be attributed to the action of bpi.

AB  == phagocytosis of unopsonized salmonella typhimurium 395, mr-10, opsonized salmonella typhimurium 395 ms, and staphylococcus epidermidis by rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes was inhibited by heparin at concentrations as low as 0.5 u/ml. inhibition was dose dependent and nearly complete at 20 u/ml. provided  that heparin concentrations did not exceed 100 u/ml, inhibition could be largely  reversed by washing. heparin also reversibly inhibited the adherence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to glass. in contrast, hexose monophosphate shunt activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated by noningested s. typhimurium mr-10 or streptococcus pyogenes b14 was not inhibited by heparin at concentrations as high as 100 u/ml.

TI  == treatment failures secondary to in vivo development of drug resistance by microorganisms.
AB  == in two patients development of resistance to antibiotics by initially sensitive infecting organisms was associated with relapse or persistence of active infection. the first patient developed staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to chloramphenicol during therapy with this agent for an infection that followed a cerebrospinal fluid shunt, and the second patient developed bacteremia due to ampicillin-resistant salmonella during therapy with ampicillin. treatment failure resulting from in vivo development of resistance to antimicrobial agents has been described for most of the major classes of antiinfective drugs and for numerous microorganisms. although in many of these instances reinfection with a resistant  organism cannot be excluded, there are many examples of apparent mutation or initial infection with both sensitive and resistant bacterial populations that is followed by selective multiplication of the resistant population or acquisition of resistance by an initially sensitive infecting organism. this phenomenon can be a cause of treatment failure and has appeared in patients in whom, by available tests, drug levels were found adequate. isolation days after the institution of antimicrobial therapy of what appears to be the same organism as was initially recovered should prompt repeated sensitivity tests, at least to the agents being administered, if the patient's clinical course has not been one of satisfactory improvement.

AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
