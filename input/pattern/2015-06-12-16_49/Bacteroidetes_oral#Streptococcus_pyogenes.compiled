TI  - Oxygen deprivation affects the antimicrobial action of LL-37 as determined by microplate real-time kinetic measurements under anaerobic conditions.
AB  - Some agents, including Escherichia coli and group A Streptococcus pyogenes cause  infections in oxygen depleted sites. LL-37 is a human host defence peptide shown previously to play an important role in controlling infections caused by these bacteria. However, the effect of oxygen levels on the antimicrobial activity of LL-37 remains obscure. In order to test the effect of oxygen (or lack thereof) on LL-37's activity against E. coli and S. pyogenes, a method for adapting commonly used microtiter plates for real-time growth-kinetic (and growth-inhibition) measurements under anaerobic conditions was developed. Using the proposed method, anaerobic conditions were attained in the microplate within 30 min and were maintained for at least five days. Anaerobiosis was further confirmed by comparing the growth of two anaerobic oral species (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in anaerobic compartments of microtiter plates versus aerobic ones. Both species grew only in the anaerobic compartments of the plates as indicated by the growth curves generated. The sensitivities of E. coli and S. pyogenes to LL-37 were tested under anaerobic conditions and compared to those in aerobic ones. The oxygen facultative E. coli grew to a higher density under aerobic conditions and its sensitivity to LL-37 was increased under anaerobiosis. The microaerophilic pathogen S. pyogenes grew faster and to a higher density under anaerobic conditions and was much more resistant to LL-37 under oxygen deprivation. Our results suggest that resistance to antimicrobial agents of microbes infecting anaerobic-microaerophilic sites should be tested under oxygen-restricted conditions.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of bactericidal potential of four root canal filling materials against microflora of infected non-vital primary teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Since complete debridement of the root canals of the primary teeth is not practically possible due to the highly variable root canal anatomy, success of the endodontic therapy depends partly on the use ofantibacterial irrigating agents and root canal filling materials. Recent literature indicates that anaerobes comprise a majority of the bacteria in necrotic root canals ofprimary teeth. The study determined the antibacterial effectiveness of four root canal filling materials namely Calcium hydroxide, Zinc oxide eugenol, Vitapex and Metapex against microbial specimens obtained directly from necrotic root canals of primary teeth. METHOD: Microbial specimens were collected using sterile paper points, from 15 primary maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth of randomly selected children in the age group of 4-10 years with infected non vital primary teeth, requiring pulpectomy procedure. The microbial specimens collected were subjected to microbiological analysis and the antimicrobial potential of root canal filling materials were tested using Agar diffusion technique. RESULTS: were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Facultative/Aerobic organisms were isolated in all the cases, anaerobic organisms were isolated in 80% of the cases, and Candida albicans was isolated in 1 case. ZOE showed superior inhibitory activity against most of the organisms isolated followed by Vitapex, Calcium hydroxide and Metapex in descending order. CONCLUSION: Our data may be useful as a guide for relative antimicrobial effectiveness or non-effectiveness of the materials employed. In vivo studies are required to state the specific antimicrobial activity and merits and demerits of any of the test filling material.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Role of the cysteine protease interpain A of Prevotella intermedia in breakdown and release of haem from haemoglobin.
AB  - The gram-negative oral anaerobe Prevotella intermedia forms an iron(III) protoporphyrin IX pigment from haemoglobin. The bacterium expresses a 90 kDa cysteine protease, InpA (interpain A), a homologue of Streptococcus pyogenes streptopain (SpeB). The role of InpA in haemoglobin breakdown and haem release was investigated. At pH 7.5, InpA mediated oxidation of oxyhaemoglobin to hydroxymethaemoglobin [in which the haem iron is oxidized to the Fe(III) state and which carries OH- as the sixth co-ordinate ligand] by limited proteolysis of globin chains as indicated by SDS/PAGE and MALDI (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization)-TOF (time-of-flight) analysis. Prolonged incubation at pH 7.5 did not result in further haemoglobin protein breakdown, but in the formation of a haemoglobin haemichrome (where the haem Fe atom is co-ordinated by another amino acid ligand in addition to the proximal histidine residue) resistant to degradation by InpA. InpA-mediated haem release from hydroxymethaemoglobin-agarose was minimal compared with trypsin at pH 7.5. At pH 6.0, InpA increased oxidation at a rate greater than auto-oxidation, producing aquomethaemoglobin (with water as sixth co-ordinate ligand), and resulted in its complete breakdown and haem loss. Aquomethaemoglobin proteolysis and haem release was prevented by blocking haem dissociation by ligation with azide, whereas InpA proteolysis of haem-free globin was rapid, even at pH 7.5. Both oxidation of oxyhaemoglobin and breakdown of methaemoglobin by InpA were inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 [trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane]. In summary, we conclude that InpA may play a central role in haem acquisition by mediating oxyhaemoglobin oxidation, and by degrading aquomethaemoglobin in which haem-globin affinity is weakened under acidic conditions.
TI  - Single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  - The participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. This study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. Each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha points for 7 d. The gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. E. faecalis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The E. faecalis and Strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus. No biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with F. nucleatum, Prop. acnes, Porph. gingivalis and Prev. intermedia. These findings suggest that Gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem, a new oral penem antibiotic, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. Time-kill kinetics were employed against strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The postantibiotic effects of faropenem were studied using strains of E. coli, S. aureus, H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that faropenem has bactericidal activity. Faropenem exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect against all strains except H. influenzae.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of rat cystatin S on an oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - We tested antibacterial and antiviral activities of rat cystatin S, a cysteine proteinase inhibitor, belonging to the family 2 cystatins against 18 different bacterial species and poliovirus type 1 (Sabin). Rat cystatin S specifically inhibited the growth of a human oral anaerobic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis due to a bactericidal effect.
TI  - Management of maxillofacial infections: a review of 50 cases.
AB  - Maxillofacial infections often place the oral and maxillofacial surgeon in situations where timely decisions have to be made. These decisions can be life-saving. This study reviews 50 infections treated over a 3-year period. The results reveal rapid resolution of the infections by adhering to fundamental principles in their management: recognition of airway compromise, surgical intervention, and the administration of the appropriate antibiotic. A protocol for the management of maxillofacial infections is described.
TI  - Activity of FCE 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
AB  - The therapeutic activity of FCE 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. In experimental pneumonia FCE 22891 was the most active antibiotic. In aerobic abscesses FCE 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against Str. pyogenes. In abscesses caused by Gram-negative bacteria, FCE 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. Cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant Esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of Ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. Cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against Gram-negative bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of Ent. cloacae. FCE 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by Bacteroides fragilis 101. We conclude that FCE 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins characterized by longer half lives.
TI  - Immunoglobulin A subclass distribution of naturally occurring salivary antibodies to microbial antigens.
AB  - The distribution of immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) and IgA2 antibodies to various microbial antigens was determined in human parotid saliva by using monoclonal antibodies to the IgA subclasses in a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. In 12 subjects examined, antibodies to Streptococcus mutans glucosyl transferase, protein antigen I/II, and cell wall carbohydrate, as well as dextrans B1355 fraction S and B512 and phosphorylcholine, occurred predominantly in the IgA1 subclass. In contrast, antibodies to lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus pyogenes and whole lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli were predominantly of the IgA2 subclass. The data indicate that in most individuals naturally occurring antibodies to a given antigen are predominantly associated with one of the two subclasses of IgA.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of clindamycin analogues: pirlimycin, 1,2 a  potent antibacterial agent.
AB  - The preparation of a series of analogues of clindamycin is described in which the naturally occurring five-membered cyclic amino acid amide portion of the molecule is replaced by a four-, six-, or seven-membered cyclic amino acid amide. The most interesting compound is pirlimycin (7e, U-57,930E), in which the (2S-trans)-4-n-propylhygramide portion of clindamycin is replaced by (2S-cis)-4-ethylpipecolamide. This structural modification results in significantly favorable changes in toxicity, metabolism, and antibacterial potency. Although the in vitro antibacterial activity of clindamycin and pirlimycin are nearly identical, the latter compound is 2-20 times more active than clindamycin when administered to mice experimentally infected with strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Plasmodium berghei. Pirlimycin is absorbed in rats and mice following both subcutaneous and oral administration. It readily penetrates B. fragilis induced abscesses in mice and is sequestered within these abscesses. A drug concentration of at least 60 times the required inhibitory concentration is maintained for 6 h following a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg/kg. Urinary excretion of total bioactivity consists only of intact pirlimycin with no other antibacterially active metabolites being detected. Pirlimycin is tolerated well in rats and mice at the administered levels.
