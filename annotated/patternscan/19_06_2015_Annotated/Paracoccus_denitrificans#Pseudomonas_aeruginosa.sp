TI  == highly sensitive and specific detection of e. coli by a sers nanobiosensor chip utilizing metallic nanosculptured thin films.
AB  == a nanobiosensor chip, utilizing surface enhanced raman spectroscopy (sers) on nanosculptured thin films (nstfs) of silver, was shown to detect escherichia coli (e. coli) bacteria down to the concentration level of a single bacterium. the sensor utilizes highly enhanced plasmonic nstfs of silver on a silicon platform for the enhancement of raman bands as checked with adsorbed 4-aminothiophenol molecules. t-4 bacteriophages were immobilized on the aforementioned surface of the chip for the specific capture of target e. coli bacteria. to demonstrate that no significant non-specific immobilization of other bacteria occurs, three different, additional bacterial strains, chromobacterium violaceum, paracoccus denitrificans and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used. furthermore, experiments performed on an additional strain of e. coli to address the specificity and reusability of the sensor showed that the sensor operates for different strains of e. coli and is reusable. time resolved phase contrast microscopy of the e. coli-t4 bacteriophage chip was performed to study its interaction with bacteria over time. results showed that the present sensor performs a fast, accurate and stable detection of e. coli with ultra-small concentrations of bacteria down to the level of a single bacterium in 10 mul volume of the sample.

TI  == group x aldehyde dehydrogenases of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 degrade hydrazones.
AB  == hydrazones are natural and synthetic compounds containing a c=n-n moiety. here we found that the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 produced nad(+)- or nadp(+)-dependent hydrazone dehydrogenase (hdh), which converts hydrazones to the corresponding hydrazides and acids rather than to the simple hydrolytic product aldehydes. gene cloning indicated that the hdh is part of the  group x aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh) family, which is distributed among bacteria, although the physiological roles of the aldh family remain unknown. the pao1 strain upregulated hdh in the presence of the hydrazone adipic acid bis(ethylidene hydrazide) (aeh). gene disruption of the hdh-encoding hdha (pa4022) decreased growth rates in culture medium containing aeh as the sole carbon source, and this effect was more obvious in the double gene disruption of  hdha and its orthologous exac (pa1984), indicating that these genes are responsible for hydrazone utilization. recombinant proteins of group x aldhs from escherichia coli, paracoccus denitrificans, and ochrobactrum anthropi also acted  as hdhs in that they produced hdh activity in the cells and degraded hydrazones.  these findings indicated the physiological roles of group x aldhs in bacteria and showed that they comprise a distinct aldh subfamily.

TI  == a complex regulatory network controls aerobic ethanol oxidation in pseudomonas aeruginosa: indication of four levels of sensor kinases and response regulators.
AB  == in addition to the known response regulator erbr (former agmr) and the two-component regulatory system erasr (former exade), three additional regulatory proteins have been identified as being involved in controlling transcription of the aerobic ethanol oxidation system in pseudomonas aeruginosa. two putative sensor kinases, ercs and ercs', and a response regulator, erdr, were found, all of which show significant similarity to the two-component flhsr system that controls methanol and formaldehyde metabolism in paracoccus denitrificans. all three identified response regulators, erar (formerly exae), erbr (formerly agmr)  and erdr, are members of the luxr family. the three sensor kinases eras (formerly exad), ercs and ercs' do not contain a membrane domain. apparently, they are localized in the cytoplasm and recognize cytoplasmic signals. inactivation of gene ercs caused an extended lag phase on ethanol. inactivation of both genes, ercs and ercs', resulted in no growth at all on ethanol, as did inactivation of erdr. of the three sensor kinases and three response regulators identified thus far, only the erasr (formerly exade) system forms a corresponding kinase/regulator pair. using reporter gene constructs of all identified regulatory genes in different mutants allowed the hierarchy of a hypothetical complex regulatory network to be established. probably, two additional sensor kinases and two additional response regulators, which are hidden among the numerous regulatory genes annotated in the genome of p. aeruginosa, remain to be  identified.

TI  == a protein-based oxygen biosensor for high-throughput monitoring of cell growth and cell viability.
AB  == fluorescently labeled hemocyanin has been previously proposed as an oxygen sensor. in this study, we explored the efficacy of this biosensor for monitoring  the biological oxygen consumption of bacteria and its use in testing bacterial cell growth and viability of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, paracoccus denitrificans, and staphylococcus simulans. using a microwell plate, the time courses for the complete deoxygenation of samples with different initial concentrations of cells were obtained and the doubling times were extracted. the  applicability of our fluorescence-based cell growth assay as an antibacterial drug screening method was also explored. the results provide a proof-of-principle for a simple, quantitative, and sensitive method for high-throughput monitoring of prokaryotic cell growth and antibiotic susceptibility screening.

TI  == microbial community of granules in expanded granular sludge bed reactor for simultaneous biological removal of sulfate, nitrate and lactate.
AB  == this study studied the cultivation of granules from an expanded granular sludge bed reactor that simultaneously transforms sulfates, nitrates, and oxygen to elementary sulfur, nitrogen gas, and carbon dioxides, respectively. the living cells accumulate at the granule outer layers, as revealed by the multicolor staining and confocal laser scanning microscope technique. the microbial community comprises sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb, desulfomicrobium sp.), heterotrophic (pseudomonas aeruginosa and sulfurospirillum sp.), and autotrophic  denitrifiers (sulfurovum sp. and paracoccus denitrificans) whose population dynamics at different sulfate and nitrate loading rates are monitored with the single-strand conformation polymorphism and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique. the desulfomicrobium sp. presents one of the dominating strains following reactor startup. at high sulfate and nitrate loading rates, the heterotrophic denitrifiers overcompete autotrophic denitrifiers to reduce srb activities. conversely, suddenly reducing nitrate loading rates completely removes the heterotrophic denitrifier sulfurospirillum sp. from the granules and activates the autotrophic denitrifiers. the physical fixation of different groups of functional strains in granules fine-tunes the strains' activities, and hence the reactor performance.

TI  == elucidation of dominant effect on initial bacterial adhesion onto polymer surfaces prepared by radiation-induced graft polymerization.
AB  == surface-modified polyethylene (pe) membrane sheets were prepared by the radiation-induced graft polymerization (rigp) of an epoxy-group-containing monomer, glycidyl methacrylate (gma). the epoxy ring of gma was opened by introducing diethylamine (dea) or sodium sulfite (ss). we examined the properties of these sheets by measuring the amount of grafting polymer, surface roughness and membrane potential, and also investigated the adhesion of five gram-negative  bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas fluorescens and paracoccus denitrificans, onto the prepared sheet surfaces. a linear relationship between the degree of grafting (dg) and surface roughness was observed. moreover, membrane potential was dependent on the amount  of dea or ss as the ionizable group. these results indicate that rigp enables the control of the physicochemical properties of such a sheet surface by adjusting dg and the subsequent conversion of functional groups. a batch test on bacterial adhesion onto the sheets clarified that the dea-containing sheet (dea sheet) exhibited an adhesion rate constant, k, significantly greater than those of other types of sheet. clearly, the adhesion rate constant of the dea sheet increased with dg, indicating that electrostatic interaction is the most decisive factor for bacterial adhesion when it works as an attractive force. furthermore, the densities of bacteria adhering onto the gma-containing sheet (gma sheet) and the  ss-containing sheet (ss sheet) were almost the same as that onto a pe sheet, whereas that onto a dea sheet significantly increased. thus, the introduction of  the gma- and ss-containing graft chain did not have much influence on bacterial adhesion onto the surfaces, supporting the conclusion that the promotion of bacterial adhesion onto the gma and ss sheets was due to an increase in surface area resulting from rigp. moreover, the scanning electron microscopy images of the sheet surfaces indicate that the conditions and morphologies of initial bacterial adhesion are dependent on surface properties, particularly membrane potential.

TI  == sequence analysis of a gene product synthesized by xanthomonas sp. during growth  on natural rubber latex.
AB  == xanthomonas sp. secretes an extracellular protein (mr approximately 70+/-5 kda) during growth on purified natural rubber [poly(1,4-cis-isoprene)] but not during  growth on water-soluble carbon sources such as glucose or gluconate. a 1.3 kbp dna fragment coding for an internal part of the structural gene of the 70 kda protein was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using amino acid  sequence information obtained after edman degradation of selected trypsin-generated peptides of the purified 70 kda protein. the pcr product was used as a dna probe to clone the complete structural gene from genomic dna of xanthomonas sp. the sequenced dna contained a 2037 bp open reading frame which coded for a polypeptide of 678 amino acids (mr 74.6 kda) and which included the features of the n-terminal signal peptidase cleavage site (mr approximately 72.9  kda for the mature protein). analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed the presence of two heme binding motifs (cxxch) and a approximately 20 amino acids long sequence that is conserved in the paracoccus denitrificans and pseudomonas aeruginosa diheme cytochrome c peroxidases (ccps). this region includes a histidine residue (h519 in xanthomonas sp. and h265 and h271 in the pseudomonas strains, respectively) that is essential for activity in ccps and that is also conserved in other bacterial oxidases. blast analysis confirmed the relatedness of the 70 kda protein to heme-containing oxidases and suggested that it is a member of a new family of relatively large (approximately 500 to approximately 1000 amino acids) extracellular proteins with so far unknown function being only  far related in amino acid sequence to p. denitrificans and p. aeruginosa ccps.

TI  == characterization of the interaction of rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c peroxidase with charge reversal mutants of cytochrome c(2).
AB  == steady-state kinetics for the reaction of rhodobacter capsulatus bacterial cytochrome c peroxidase (bccp) with its substrate cytochrome c(2) were investigated. the rb. capsulatus bccp is dependent on calcium for activation as previously shown for the pseudomonas aeruginosa bccp and paracoccus denitrificans enzymes. furthermore, the activity shows a bell-shaped ph dependence with optimum at ph 7.0. enzyme activity is greatest at low ionic strength and drops off steeply as ionic strength increases, resulting in an apparent interaction domain  charge product of -13. all cytochromes c(2) show an asymmetric distribution of surface charge, with a concentration of 14 positive charges near the exposed heme edge of rb. capsulatus c(2) which potentially may interact with approximately 6 negative charges, localized near the edge of the high-potential heme of the rb. capsulatus bccp. to test this proposal, we constructed charge reversal mutants of the 14 positively charged residues located on the front face of rb. capsulatus cytochrome c(2) and examined their effect on steady-state kinetics with bccp. mutated residues in rb. capsulatus cytochrome c(2) that showed the greatest effects on binding and enzyme activity are k12e, k14e, k54e, k84e, k93e, and k99e, which is consistent with the site of electron transfer being located at the heme edge. we conclude that a combination of long-range, nonspecific electrostatic interactions as well as localized salt bridges between, e.g., cytochrome c(2) k12, k14, k54, and k99 with bccp d194, d241, and d6, account for  the observed kinetics.

TI  == redox properties of an engineered purple cu(a) azurin.
AB  == purple cu(a) centers are a class of binuclear, mixed-valence copper complexes found in cytochrome c oxidase and nitrous oxide reductase. an engineered cu(a) protein was formed by replacing a portion of the amino acid sequence that contains three of the ligands to the native type i copper center of pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin with the corresponding portion of sequence from the cu(a) center of cytochrome c oxidase from paracoccus denitrificans [proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 93 (1996) 461]. oxidation-reduction midpoint potential (e(m)) values of  the cu(a) azurin of +399+/-10 and +380+/-2mv, respectively, were determined by cyclic voltammetry and spectrochemical titration. an n value of one was obtained, indicating that the redox reaction is cycling between the mixed valence and the fully reduced states. whereas the e(m) value of native azurin is ph dependent, the e(m) value of cu(a) azurin is not, as expected for the cu(a) center. similarities and differences in the redox properties are discussed in terms of the known crystal structures of cu(a) centers in cytochrome c oxidase and cu(a) azurin.

TI  == a cytochrome c peroxidase from pseudomonas nautica 617 active at high ionic strength: expression, purification and characterization.
AB  == cytochrome c peroxidase was expressed in cells of pseudomonas nautica strain 617  grown under microaerophilic conditions. the 36.5 kda dihaemic enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity in three chromatographic steps. n-terminal sequence comparison showed that the ps. nautica enzyme exhibits a high similarity with the corresponding proteins from paracoccus denitrificans and pseudomonas aeruginosa. uv-visible spectra confirm calcium activation of the enzyme through spin state transition of the peroxidatic haem. monohaemic cytochrome c(552) from  ps. nautica was identified as the physiological electron donor, with a half-saturating concentration of 122 microm and allowing a maximal catalytic centre activity of 116,000 min(-1). using this cytochrome the enzyme retained the same activity even at high ionic strength. there are indications that the interactions between the two redox partners are mainly hydrophobic in nature.

TI  == paramagnetic nmr studies of blue and purple copper proteins.
AB  == 1h- and 13c-nmr spectroscopy is applied to investigate the cu(a) and type 1 active sites of copper proteins in solution. the analysis of hyperfine shifted 1h resonances allows the comparison of the electron spin density delocalization in the cu(a) site of the wild-type soluble domains of various cytochrome c oxidases  (thermus thermophilus, paracoccus denitrificans, and paracoccus versutus) and genetically engineered constructs (soluble domain of quinol oxidase from escherichia coli and thiobacillus versutus amicyanin). comparable spin densities  are found on the two terminal his ligands for the wild-type constructs as opposed to the engineered proteins where the spin is more unevenly distributed on the two his residues. a reevaluation of the cys h(beta) chemical shifts that is in agreement with the data published for both the p. denitrificans and the p. versutus cu(a) soluble domains confirms the thermal accessibility of the 2b(3u) electronic excited state and indicates the existence of slightly different spin densities on the two bridging cys ligands. the 13c-nmr spectrum of isotopically enriched oxidized azurin from pseudomonas aeruginosa reveals six fast relaxing signals, which can be partially identified by 1- and 2-dimensional (1-d, 2-d) direct detection techniques combined with 3-d triple resonance experiments. the observed contact shifts suggest the presence of direct spin density transfer and  spin polarization mechanisms for the delocalization of the unpaired electron.

TI  == does the reduction of c heme trigger the conformational change of crystalline nitrite reductase?
AB  == the structures of nitrite reductase from paracoccus denitrificans gb17 (nir-pd) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (nir-pa) have been described for the oxidized and reduced state (fulop, v., moir, j. w. b., ferguson, s. j., and hajdu, j. (1995) cell 81, 369-377; nurizzo, d., silvestrini, m. c., mathieu, m., cutruzzola, f., bourgeois, d., fulop, v., hajdu, j., brunori, m., tegoni, m., and cambillau, c. (1997) structure 5, 1157-1171; nurizzo, d., cutruzzola, f., arese, m., bourgeois, d., brunori, m., cambillau, c. , and tegoni, m. (1998) biochemistry 37, 13987-13996). major conformational rearrangements are observed in the extreme states although they are more substantial in nir-pd. the four structures differ significantly in the c heme domains. upon reduction, a his17/met106 heme-ligand switch is observed in nir-pd together with concerted movements of the tyr in the  distal site of the d1 heme (tyr10 in nir-pa, tyr25 in nir-pd) and of a loop of the c heme domain (56-62 in nir-pa, 99-116 in nir-pd). whether the reduction of the c heme, which undergoes the major rearrangements, is the trigger of these movements is the question addressed by our study. this conformational reorganization is not observed in the partially reduced species, in which the c heme is partially or largely (15-90%) reduced but the d1 heme is still oxidized.  these results suggest that the d1 heme reduction is likely to be responsible of the movements. we speculate about the mechanistic explanation as to why the opening of the d1 heme distal pocket only occurs upon electron transfer to the d1 heme itself, to allow binding of the physiological substrate no2- exclusively to  the reduced metal center.

TI  == enhanced rate of intramolecular electron transfer in an engineered purple cua azurin.
AB  == the recent expression of an azurin mutant where the blue type 1 copper site is replaced by the purple cua site of paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c oxidase  has yielded an optimal system for examining the unique electron mediation properties of the binuclear cua center, because both type 1 and cua centers are placed in the same location in the protein while all other structural elements remain the same. long-range electron transfer is induced between the disulfide radical anion, produced pulse radiolytically, and the oxidized binuclear cua center in the purple azurin mutant. the rate constant of this intramolecular process, ket = 650 +/- 60 s-1 at 298 k and ph 5.1, is almost 3-fold faster than for the same process in the wild-type single blue copper azurin from pseudomonas  aeruginosa (250 +/- 20 s-1), in spite of a smaller driving force (0.69 ev for purple cua azurin vs. 0.76 ev for blue copper azurin). the reorganization energy  of the cua center is calculated to be 0.4 ev, which is only 50% of that found for the wild-type azurin. these results represent a direct comparison of electron transfer properties of the blue and purple cua sites in the same protein framework and provide support for the notion that the binuclear purple cua center is a more efficient electron transfer agent than the blue single copper center because reactivity of the former involves a lower reorganization energy.

TI  == characterization of cytochrome c-556 from the purple phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus as a cytochrome-c peroxidase.
AB  == a cytochrome c-556 was purified from rhodobacter capsulatus and the complete amino acid sequence was determined. it contains 328 amino acid residues and two typical heme-binding sites at cysteine residues 54 and 57 and at residues 200 and 203. it is homologous to the family of bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases (bccp)  with 69% identity to paracoccus denitrificans bccp and 60% identity to pseudomonas aeruginosa bccp for which there is a three-dimensional structure. there is lesser similarity to the maug gene products from methylotrophic bacteria which are thought to be involved in biosynthesis of the quinone cofactor of methylamine dehydrogenase. translated genes from escherichia coli and helicobacter pylori are also related to the bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases. the divergence of this family of proteins is reflected in the fact that the reported sixth heme ligands are not conserved, except in pseudomonas, rhodobacter and paracoccus. this suggests that homologs of bccp may fold differently and/or may not have the same enzymatic activity as the prototypic protein from ps. aeruginosa. we found that the rb. capsulatus bccp is active with both rb. capsulatus cytochrome c2 and with horse cytochrome c as substrates (km values 60  microm and 6 microm, respectively). the turnover number was 40 s(-1) and the km for peroxide was 33 microm. we have thus confirmed that the rb. capsulatus protein is a cytochrome c peroxidase.

TI  == conformational changes occurring upon reduction and no binding in nitrite reductase from pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == nitrite reductase (nir) from pseudomonas aeruginosa (ec 1.9.3.2) (nir-pa) is a soluble enzyme catalyzing the reduction of nitrite (no2-) to nitric oxide (no). the enzyme is a 120 kda homodimer, in which each monomer carries one c and one d1 heme. the oxidized and reduced forms of nir from paracoccus denitrificans gb17 (previously called thiosphaera pantotropha) (nir-pd) have been described [fulop,  v., et al. (1995) cell 81, 369-377; williams, p. a., et al. (1997) nature 389, 406-412], and we recently reported on the structure of oxidized nir-pa at 2.15 a  [nurizzo, d., et al. (1997) structure 5, 1157-1171]. although the domains carrying the d1 heme are almost identical in both nir-pa and nir-pd oxidized and  reduced structures, the c heme domains show a different pattern of c heme coordination, depending on the species and the redox state. the sixth d1 heme ligand in oxidized nir-pd was found to be tyr25, whereas in nir-pa, the homologuous tyr10 does not interact directly with fe3+, but via a hydroxide ion.  furthermore, upon reduction, the axial ligand of the c heme of nir-pd changes from his17 to met108. finally, in the oxidized nir-pa structure, the n-terminal stretch of residues (1-29) of one monomer interacts with the other monomer (domain swapping), which does not occur in nir-pd. here the structure of reduced  nir-pa is described both in the unbound form and with the physiological product,  no, bound at the d1 heme active site. although both structures are similar to that of reduced nir-pd, significant differences with respect to oxidized nir-pd were observed in two regions: (i) a loop in the c heme domain (residues 56-62) is shifted 6 a away and (ii) the hydroxide ion, which is the sixth coordination ligand of the heme, is removed upon reduction and no binding and the tyr10 side chain rotates away from the position adopted in the oxidized form. the conformational changes observed in nir-pa as the result of reduction are less extensive than those occurring in nir-pd. starting with oxidized structures that  differ in many respects, the two enzymes converge, yielding reduced conformations which are very similar to each other, which indicates that the conformational changes involved in catalysis are considerably diverse.

TI  == cell biology and molecular basis of denitrification.
AB  == denitrification is a distinct means of energy conservation, making use of n oxides as terminal electron acceptors for cellular bioenergetics under anaerobic, microaerophilic, and occasionally aerobic conditions. the process is an essential branch of the global n cycle, reversing dinitrogen fixation, and is associated with chemolithotrophic, phototrophic, diazotrophic, or organotrophic metabolism but generally not with obligately anaerobic life. discovered more than a century  ago and believed to be exclusively a bacterial trait, denitrification has now been found in halophilic and hyperthermophilic archaea and in the mitochondria of fungi, raising evolutionarily intriguing vistas. important advances in the biochemical characterization of denitrification and the underlying genetics have  been achieved with pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, paracoccus denitrificans, ralstonia eutropha, and rhodobacter sphaeroides. pseudomonads represent one of the largest assemblies of the denitrifying bacteria within a single genus, favoring their use as model organisms. around 50 genes are required within a single bacterium to encode the core structures of the denitrification apparatus. much of the denitrification process of gram-negative bacteria has been found confined to the periplasm, whereas the topology and enzymology of the gram-positive bacteria are less well established. the activation and enzymatic transformation of n oxides is based on the redox chemistry of fe, cu, and mo. biochemical breakthroughs have included the x-ray structures of the two types of  respiratory nitrite reductases and the isolation of the novel enzymes nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase, as well as their structural characterization by indirect spectroscopic means. this revealed unexpected relationships among denitrification enzymes and respiratory oxygen reductases. denitrification is intimately related to fundamental cellular processes that include primary and secondary transport, protein translocation, cytochrome c biogenesis, anaerobic gene regulation, metalloprotein assembly, and the biosynthesis of the cofactors molybdopterin and heme d1. an important class of regulators for the anaerobic expression of the denitrification apparatus are transcription factors of the greater fnr family. nitrate and nitric oxide, in addition to being respiratory substrates, have been identified as signaling molecules for the induction of distinct n oxide-metabolizing enzymes.

TI  == structural characterization of paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c peroxidase and assignment of the low and high potential heme sites.
AB  == the amino acid sequence of the diheme cytochrome c peroxidase from paracoccus denitrificans has been determined as the result of sequence analysis of peptides  generated by chemical and enzymatic cleavages of the apoprotein. the sequence shows 60% similarity to the cytochrome c peroxidase from pseudomonas aeruginosa,  39% similarity to an open reading frame encoding a putative triheme c-type cytochrome in escherichia coli, and remote similarity to the maug proteins from two methylotrophic bacteria. it is proposed, on the basis of the pattern of conserved residues in the sequences, that a change in iron coordination in the n-terminal heme domain may accompany reduction to the active mixed valence state, a change which may be accompanied by conformational adjustments in the highly conserved interface between the n- and c-terminal domains. these conformational adjustments may also lead to the appearance of a second ca2+ binding site in the  mixed valence enzyme. the exposed edge of the heme in the c-terminal domain is surrounded by several different patterns of charged residues in the paracoccus and pseudomonas enzymes, and this is consistent with the interaction of the former with the highly positively charged front face of the donor cytochrome c-550.

TI  == enzyme diversity and mosaic gene organization in denitrification.
AB  == denitrification is a main branch of the global nitrogen cycle. in the past ten years unravelling the underlying biochemistry and genetics has proceeded at an increasing pace. fungal denitrification has become a new field. the biochemical investigation of denitrification has culminated in the description of the crystal structures of the two types of nitrite reductases. the n2o reductase shares with  cytochrome c oxidase the cua center as a structurally novel metal site. the cytochrome b subunit of no reductase has a striking conservation of heme-binding  transmembrane segments versus the subunit i of cytochrome c oxidase. another putative denitrification gene product shows structural relation to the subunit iii of the oxidase. n2o reductase and no reductase may be ancestors of energy-conserving enzymes of the heme-copper oxidase superfamily. more than 30 genes for denitrification are located in a > 30-kb cluster in pseudomonas stutzeri, and comparable gene clusters have been identified in pseudomonas aeruginosa and paracoccus denitrificans. genes necessary for nitrite reduction and no reduction have a mosaic arrangement with very few conserved locations within these clusters and relative to each other.

AB  == the genes that encode the hc-type nitric-oxide reductase from paracoccus denitrificans have been identified. they are part of a cluster of six genes (norcbqdef) and are found near the gene cluster that encodes the cd1-type nitrite reductase, which was identified earlier [de boer, a. p. n., reijnders, w. n. m.,  kuenen, j. g., stouthamer, a. h. & van spanning, r. j. m. (1994) isolation, sequencing and mutational analysis of a gene cluster involved in nitrite reduction in paracoccus denitrificans, antonie leeu wenhoek 66, 111-127]. norc and norb encode the cytochrome-c-containing subunit ii and cytochrome b-containing subunit i of nitric-oxide reductase (no reductase), respectively. norq encodes a protein with an atp-binding motif and has high similarity to nirq  from pseudomonas stutzeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa and cbbq from pseudomonas hydrogenothermophila. nore encodes a protein with five putative transmembrane alpha-helices and has similarity to coxiii, the third subunit of the aa3-type cytochrome-c oxidases. norf encodes a small protein with two putative transmembrane alpha-helices. mutagenesis of norc, norb, norq and nord resulted in cells unable to grow anaerobically. nitrite reductase and no reductase (with succinate or ascorbate as substrates) and nitrous oxide reductase (with succinate as substrate) activities were not detected in these mutant strains. nitrite extrusion was detected in the medium, indicating that nitrate reductase was active. the norq and nord mutant strains retained about 16% and 23% of the wild-type level of norc, respectively. the nore and norf mutant strains had specific growth rates and norc contents similar to those of the wild-type strain, but had reduced nor and nir activities, indicating that their gene products are involved in regulation of enzyme activity. mutant strains containing the norcbqdef region on the broad-host-range vector peg400 were able to grow anaerobically, although at a lower specific growth rate and with lower nor activity compared with the wild-type strain.

TI  == construction and characterization of an azurin analog for the purple copper site  in cytochrome c oxidase.
AB  == a protein analog of a purple copper center has been constructed from a recombinant blue copper protein (pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin) by replacing the  loop containing the three ligands to the blue copper center with the corresponding loop of the cua center in cytochrome c oxidase (cox) from paracoccus denitrificans. the electronic absorption in the uv and visible region  (uv-vis) and electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectra of this analog are remarkably similar to those of the native cua center in cox from paracoccus denitrificans. the above spectra can be obtained upon addition of a mixture of cu2+ and cu+. addition of cu2+ only results in a uv-vis spectrum consisting of absorptions from both a purple copper center and a blue copper center. this spectrum can be converted to the spectrum of a pure purple copper by a prolonged  incubation in the air, or by addition of excess ascorbate. the azurin mutant reported here is an example of an engineered purple copper center with the a480/a530 ratio greater than 1 and with no detectable hyperfines, similar to those of the cua sites in cox of bovine heart and of paracoccus denitrificans.

AB  == nitrite reductase (cytochrome cd1) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from the soluble extract of the marine denitrifying bacterium pseudomonas nautica strain 617. cells were anaerobically grown with 10 mm nitrate as final electron acceptor. the soluble fraction was purified by four successive chromatographic steps and the purest cytochrome cd1 exhibited an a280 nm(oxidized)/a410nm(oxidized) coefficient of 0.90. in the course of purification, cytochrome cd1 specific activity presented a maximum value of 0.048 units/mg of protein. this periplasmic enzyme is a homodimer and each 60 kda subunit contains  one heme c and one heme d1 as prosthetic moieties, both in a low spin state. redox potentials of hemes c and d1 were determined at three different ph values (6.6, 7.6 and 8.6) and did not show any ph dependence. the first 20 amino acids of the nh2-terminal region of the protein were identified and the sequence showed 45% identity with the corresponding region of pseudomonas aeruginosa nitrite reductase but no homology to pseudomonas stutzeri and paracoccus denitrificans enzymes. spectroscopic properties of pseudomonas nautica 617 cytochrome cd1 in the ultraviolet-visible range and in electron paramagnetic resonance are described. the formation of a heme d1 -nitric-oxide complex as an intermediate of nitrite reduction was demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance experiments.

AB  == a chromosomal fragment containing dna downstream from mauc was isolated from paracoccus denitrificans. sequence analysis of this fragment revealed the presence of four open reading frames, all transcribed in the same direction. the  products of the putative genes were found to be highly similar to mauj, maug, maum and maun of methylobacterium extorquens am1. using these four mau genes, 11  mau genes have been cloned from p. denitrificans to date. the gene order is maurfbedacjgmn, which is similar to that in m. extorquens am1. maul, present in m. extorquens am1, seems to be absent in p. denitrificans. mauj is predicted to be a cytoplasmic protein, and maug a periplasmic protein. the latter protein contains two putative heme-binding sites, and has some sequence resemblance to the cytochrome c peroxidase from pseudomonas aeruginosa. maum is also predicted to be located in the periplasm, but maun appears to be membrane associated. both  resemble ferredoxin-like proteins and contain four and two motifs, respectively,  characteristic for [4fe-4s] clusters. inactivation of maua, mauj, maug, maum and  maun was carried out by introduction of unmarked mutations in the chromosomal copies of these genes. maua and maug mutant strains were unable to grow on methylamine. the mauj mutant strain had an impaired growth rate and showed a lower dye-linked methylamine dehydrogenase (madh) activity than the parent strain. mutations in maum and maun had no effect on methylamine metabolism. the maua mutant strain specifically lacked the beta subunit of madh, but the alpha subunit and amicyanin, the natural electron acceptors of madh, were still produced. the maug mutant strain synthesized the alpha and beta subunits of madh  as well as amicyanin. however, no dye-linked madh activity was found in this mutant strain. in addition, as the wild-type enzyme displays a characteristic fluorescence emission spectrum upon addition of methylamine, this property was lost in the maug mutant strain. these results clearly show that maug is essential for the maturation of the beta subunit of madh, presumably via a step in the biosynthesis of tryptophan tryptophylquinone, the cofactor of madh. the mau gene  cluster maurfbedacjgmn was cloned on the broad-host vector peg400. transfer of this construct to mutant strains which were unable to grow on methylamine fully restored their ability to grow on this compound. a similar result was achieved for the closely related bacterium thiosphaera pantotropha, which is unable to utilize methylamine as the sole sources of carbon and energy.

TI  == the fnr family of transcriptional regulators.
AB  == homologues of the transcriptional regulator fnr from escherichia coli have been identified in a variety of taxonomically diverse bacterial species. despite being structurally very similar, members of the fnr family have disparate regulatory roles. those from shewanella putrefaciens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas stutzeri and rhodopseudomonas palustris are functionally similar to fnr in that they regulate anaerobic respiration or carbon metabolism. four rhizobial proteins (from rhizobium meliloti, r. leguminosarum, b. japonicum and azorhizobium caulinodans) are involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation; a fifth (from rhizobium strain ic3342) has unknown function. two proteins from mammalian pathogens (actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and bordetella pertussis) may be involved in the regulation of toxin expression. the fnr protein of vibrio fischeri regulates bioluminescence, and the function of the one known fnr homologue from a gram-positive organism (lactobacillus casei) remains to be elucidated. some members of this family, like fnr itself, appear to function as sensors of oxygen availability, whereas others do not. the ability to sense and respond to oxygen limitation may be correlated with the presence of cysteine residues which, in the case of fnr, are thought to be involved in oxygen or redox sensing. the mechanism of dna sequence recognition is probably conserved, or very similar, throughout this family. in a number of other gram-negative species, there is good indirect evidence for the existence of fnr analogues; these include alcaligenes eutrophus, a. denitrificans, a. faecalis, paracoccus denitrificans and a number of pseudomonas species.

TI  == spectroscopic characterization of cytochrome c peroxidase from paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == the cytochrome c peroxidase of paracoccus denitrificans is similar to the well-studied enzyme from pseudomonas aeruginosa. like the pseudomonas enzyme, the paracoccus peroxidase contains two haem c groups, one high potential and one low  potential. the high-potential haem acts as a source of the second electron for h2o2 reduction, and the low-potential haem acts as a peroxidatic centre. reduction with ascorbate of the high-potential haem of the paracoccus enzyme results in a switch of the low-potential haem to a high-spin state, as shown by visible and n.m.r. spectroscopy. this high-spin haem of the mixed-valence enzyme  is accessible to ligands and binds cn- with a kd of 5 microm. the paracoccus enzyme is significantly different from that from pseudomonas in the time course of high-spin formation after reduction of the high-potential haem, and in the requirement for bivalent cations. reduction with 1 mm ascorbate at ph 6 is complete within 2 min, and this is followed by a slow appearance of the high-spin state with a half-time of 10 min. thus the process of reduction and spin state change can be easily separated in time and the intermediate form obtained. this separation is also evident in e.p.r. spectra, although the slow change involves an alteration in the low-spin ligation at this temperature rather than a change in spin state. the separation is even more striking at ph 7.5, where no high-spin form is obtained until 1 mm ca2+ is added to the mixed-valence enzyme. the spin-state switch of the low-potential haem shifts the midpoint redox potential of the high-potential haem by 50 mv, a further indication of haem-haem interaction.

TI  == kinetics of photooxidation of soluble cytochromes, hipip, and azurin by the photosynthetic reaction center of the purple phototrophic bacterium rhodopseudomonas viridis.
AB  == the photosynthetic reaction center of rhodopseudomonas viridis contains a bound tetraheme cytochrome c subunit which is the primary electron donor to the photooxidized special pair bacteriochlorophyll. we have tested a variety of soluble electron-transfer proteins for their ability to serve as secondary electron donors to the bacteriochlorophyll via the bound cytochrome by measuring  the kinetics of reaction center heme reduction following photooxidation by a laser flash, as a function of soluble protein concentration and ionic strength. all of the soluble redox proteins utilized appear to interact with a negatively charged region on the reaction center and to transfer electrons to the 300-mv heme c-556 of the bound cytochrome. rps. viridis cytochrome c2 was the best electron donor among those proteins tested, with a second-order rate constant extrapolated to infinite ionic strength of 1.2 x 10(6) m-1 s-1, which is two orders of magnitude larger than that of horse cytochrome c. rps. viridis cytochrome c2 apparently binds to the reaction center at low ionic strength, as evidenced by a nonlinear dependence of kobs on protein concentration. the limiting first-order electron-transfer rate constant at 6 mm ionic strength is approximately 1300 s-1. horse cytochrome c and the reaction center also form a complex, with a limiting first-order rate constant for electron transfer which is 5 times smaller than for cytochrome c2. other cytochromes c2 are intermediate in  reactivity. more distantly related cytochromes, hipip, and azurin are relatively  poor electron donors under the conditions of assay.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == metabolic pathways in paracoccus denitrificans and closely related bacteria in relation to the phylogeny of prokaryotes.
AB  == denitrification and methylotrophy in paracoccus denitrificans are discussed. the  properties of the enzymes of denitrification: the nitrate-nitrite antiporter, nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase are described. the genes for none of these proteins have yet been cloned and sequenced from p. denitrificans. a number of sequences are available for enzymes from escherichia coli, pseudomonas stutzeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa. it is concluded that pathway specific c-type cytochromes are involved in denitrification. at least 40 genes are involved in denitrification. in methanol oxidation at least 20 genes are involved. in this case too pathway specific c-type cytochromes are involved. the sequence homology between the quinoproteins methanol dehydrogenase, alcoholde-hydrogenase and glucose dehydrogenase is discussed. this superfamily of proteins is believed to be derived from a common ancestor. the moxfjgi operon determines the structural components of methanol dehydrogenase and the associated c-type cytochrome. upstream of this operon 3 regulatory proteins were found. the moxy protein shows  the general features of a sensor protein and the moxx protein those of a regulatory protein. thus a two component regulatory system is involved in both denitrification and methylotrophy. the phylogeny of prokaryotes based on 16s rrna sequence is discussed. it is remarkable that the 16s rrna of thiosphaera pantotropha is identical to that of p. denitrificans. still these bacteria show a number of differences. t. pantotropha is able to denitrify under aerobic circumstances and it shows heterotrophic nitrification. nitrification and heterotrophic nitrification are found in species belonging to the beta-and gamma-subdivisions of purple non-sulfur bacteria. thus the occurrence of heterotrophic nitrification in t. pantotropha, which belongs to the alpha-subdivision of purple non-sulfur bacteria is a remarkable property. furthermore t. pantotropha contains two nitrate reductases of which the periplasmic one is supposed to be involved in aerobic denitrification. the nitrite reductase is of the cu-type and not of the cytochrome cd1 type as in p. denitrificans. also the cytochrome b of the qbc complex of t. pantotropha is highly similar to its counterpart in p. denitrificans. it is hypothesized that the differences between these two organisms which both contain large megaplasmids is due to a combination of loss of genetic information and plasmid-coded properties. the distribution of a number of complex metabolic systems in eubacteria and in a number of species belonging to the alpha-group of purple non  sulphur bacteria is reviewed.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the course of denitrification of nitrate, nitrite and both compounds together by  static cultures of paracoccus denitrificans, pseudomonas stutzeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied. these strains represent three different types of denitrification: 1. reduction of nitrate to gaseous nitrogen without accumulation of nitrite (p. denitrificans); 2. partial accumulation of nitrite in growing cultures during reduction of nitrate to gaseous nitrogen (p. aeruginosa) and 3. two-phase denitrification that includes reduction of nitrates at the very beginning of the process, and then, after depletion of the former, the reduction  of nitrates to gaseous nitrogen (p. stutzeri). these observations differ from the results reported in the literature and possible reasons are discussed.

TI  == the cytochrome c peroxidase of paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == the size, visible absorption spectra, nature of haem and haem content suggest that the cytochrome c peroxidase of paracoccus denitrificans is related to that of pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, the paracoccus enzyme shows a preference for  cytochrome c donors with a positively charged 'front surface' and in this respect resembles the cytochrome c peroxidase from saccharomyces cerevisiae. paracoccus cytochrome c-550 is the best electron donor tested and, in spite of an acidic isoelectric point, has a markedly asymmetric charge distribution with a strongly  positive 'front face'. mitochondrial cytochromes c have a much less pronounced charge asymmetry but are basic overall. this difference between cytochrome c-550  and mitochondrial cytochrome c may reflect subtle differences in their electron transport roles. a dendrogram of cytochrome c1 sequences shows that rhodopseudomonas viridis is a closer relative of mitochondria than is pa. denitrificans. perhaps a mitochondrial-type cytochrome c peroxidase may be found  in such an organism.

TI  == metabolic regulation including anaerobic metabolism in paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == under anaerobic circumstances in the presence of nitrate paracoccus denitrificans is able to denitrify. the properties of the reductases involved in nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase are described. for that purpose not only the properties of the enzymes of p. denitrificans are considered but also those from escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pseudomonas stutzeri. nitrate reductase consists of three subunits: the alpha subunit contains the molybdenum cofactor, the beta subunit contains the iron sulfur clusters, and the gamma subunit is a special cytochrome  b. nitrate is reduced at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and evidence for the presence of a nitrate-nitrite antiporter is presented. electron flow is from  ubiquinol via the specific cytochrome b to the nitrate reductase. nitrite reductase (which is identical to cytochrome cd1) and nitrous oxide reductase are  periplasmic proteins. nitric oxide reductase is a membrane-bound enzyme. the bc1  complex is involved in electron flow to these reductases and the whole reaction takes place at the periplasmic side of the membrane. it is now firmly established that no is an obligatory intermediate between nitrite and nitrous oxide. nitrous  oxide reductase is a multi-copper protein. a large number of genes is involved in the acquisition of molybdenum and copper, the formation of the molybdenum cofactor, and the insertion of the metals. it is estimated that at least 40 genes are involved in the process of denitrification. the control of the expression of  these genes in p. denitrificans is totally unknown. as an example of such complex regulatory systems the function of the fnr, narx, and narl gene products in the expression of nitrate reductase in e. coli is described. the control of the effects of oxygen on the reduction of nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide are discussed. oxygen inhibits reduction of nitrate by prevention of nitrate uptake in the cell. in the case of nitrite and nitrous oxide a competition between reductases and oxidases for a limited supply of electrons from primary dehydrogenases seems to play an important role. under some circumstances no formed from nitrite may inhibit oxidases, resulting in a redistribution of electron flow from oxygen to nitrite. p. denitrificans contains three main oxidases: cytochrome aa3, cytochrome o, and cytochrome co. cytochrome o is proton translocating and receives its electrons from ubiquinol. some properties of cytochrome co, which receives its electrons from cytochrome c, are reported.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the production and utilization of nitric oxide by a new, denitrifying strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == when a new strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was grown aerobically and then transferred to anaerobic conditions, cells reduced no3- quantitatively to no2- in no3(-)-respiration. in the absence of nitrate, no2- was immediately reduced to no or n2o but not to n2 indicating that no2(-)-reductase but not n2o-reductase was active. the formation of the products no or n2o depended on the ph in the medium  and the concentration of no2- present. when p. aeruginosa was grown anaerobically for at least three days n2o-reductase was also active. such cells reduced no to n2 via n2o. the new strain generated at h(+)-gradient and grew by reducing n2o to n2 but not by converting no to n2o. for comparison, azospirillum brasilense sp7 showed the same pattern of no-reduction. in contrast, paracoccus denitrificans formed 3.5 h+/no during the reduction of no to n2o in oxidant pulse experiments but could not grow in the presence of no. thus the no-reduction pattern in p. denitrificans on one side and p. aeruginosa and a. brasilense on the other was very different. the mechanistic implications of such differences are discussed.

AB  == denitrification by paracoccus denitrificans and pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied using quadrupole membrane-inlet mass spectrometry to measure simultaneously and continuously dissolved gases. evidence was provided for aerobic denitrification by both species: in the presence of o2, n2o production increased in pa. denitrificans, while that of n2 decreased; with ps. aeruginosa,  the concentrations of both n2 and n2o increased on introducing o2 into the gas phase. disappearance of no-3 was monitored in anaerobically and aerobically grown cells which were maintained either anaerobically or aerobically: the rate and extent of no-3 utilization by both species depended on growth and maintenance conditions. the initial rate of disappearance was most rapid under completely anaerobic conditions, and lowest rates occurred when cells were grown anaerobically and maintained aerobically. in nitrogen balance experiments both species converted over 87% of the added no-3 to n2 and n2o under both anaerobic and aerobic maintenance conditions.

TI  == redox protein electron-transfer mechanisms: electrostatic interactions as a determinant of reaction site in c-type cytochromes.
AB  == the effect of ionic strength on the rate constant for electron transfer has been  used to determine the magnitude and charge sign of the net electrostatic potential which exists in close proximity to the sites of electron transfer on various c-type cytochromes. the negatively charged ferricyanide ion preferentially reacts at the positively charged exposed heme edge region on the front side of horse cytochrome c and paracoccus cytochrome c2. in contrast, at low ionic strength, the positively charged cobalt phenanthroline ion interacts with the negatively charged back side of cytochrome c2, and at high ionic strength at a positively charged site on the front side of the cytochrome. with horse cytochrome c, over the ionic strength range studied, cobalt phenanthroline  reacts only at a positively charged site which is probably not at the heme edge.  these inorganic oxidants do not react at the relatively uncharged exposed heme edge sites on azotobacter cytochrome c5 and pseudomonas cytochrome c-551, but rather at a negatively charged site which is away from the heme edge. the results demonstrate that at least two electron-transferring sites on a single cytochrome  can be functional, depending on the redox reactant used and the ionic strength. electrostatic interactions between charge distributions on the cytochrome surface and the other reactant, or interactions involving uncharged regions on the protein(s), are critical in determining the preferred sites of electron transfer  and reaction rate constants. when unfavorable electrostatic effects occur at a site near the redox center, less optimal sites at a greater distance can become kinetically important.

TI  == trapping of nitric oxide produced during denitrification by extracellular hemoglobin.
AB  == a spectrophotometric method has been developed that uses extracellular hemoglobin (hb) to trap nitric oxide (no) released during denitrification as nitrosyl hemoglobin (hbno). the rate of complexation of no with hb is about at the diffusion controlled limit for protein molecules and the product, hbno, is essentially stable. hb was added to an anaerobic bacterial suspension and denitrification was initiated with either kno2 or kno3. hbno formation was observed for six species of denitrifying bacteria and showed isosbestic points at 544, 568, and 586 nm. cellular no production, presumably by nitrite reductase, was kinetically distinct from the much slower chemical reaction of hb with kno2 to form methemoglobin and hbno. the rate of hbno formation was proportional to cell density, essentially independent of ph from 6.8 to 7.4, nearly zero order in [hb] and, at least with paracoccus denitrificans, strongly inhibited by rotenone  and antimycin a. the cu chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate, had no effect on hbno formation by pa. denitrificans, but abolished that by achromobacter cycloclastes  which uses a cu-containing nitrite reductase known to be inactivated by the chelator. hbno formation did not occur with non-denitrifying bacteria. the stoichiometry at high [hb] for conversion of hb to hbno was 1.3-1.8 kno2 per hb for pa. denitrificans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a. cycloclastes and about 3.4  for pseudomonas stutzeri. the former range of values corresponds to a partition of about 2 n atoms in 3 toward trapping and 1 in 3 toward reduction on the pathway to n2. nitrogen not trapped appeared largely as n2o in presence of acetylene. the results are consistent with a model in which no is a freely diffusible intermediate between nitrite and n2o, providing that nitric oxide reductase is or nearly is a diffusion controlled enzyme.

TI  == loss of n2o reductase activity as an explanation for poor growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa on n2o.
AB  == n2o uptake activity of cells and n2o reductase activity of the soluble fraction from denitrifying bacteria were assayed. pseudomonas aeruginosa strains pao1 and  p1 lost most of their n2o uptake activity and the ability to grow well on n2o within 2 to 5 h after exposure to n2o. extensive loss of n2o reductase activity accompanied the nearly complete loss of n2o uptake activity under n2o. paracoccus denitrificans retained much, but not all, of both activities and the ability to grow vigorously on n2o. the pattern with p. aeruginosa strain p2 resembled that for pao1 and p1 except that loss of the activities proceeded at a slower rate and growth could continue for up to 12 h after exposure to n2o. the inability of a number of p. aeruginosa strains to grow well on n2o is therefore a direct consequence of the nearly complete loss of n2o reductase activity. turnover-dependent inactivation of n2o reductase and its reactivation under reducing conditions occurred in vitro for the enzyme from p. aeruginosa and paracoccus denitrificans. these events may be significant in determining the activity level of n2o reductase in denitrifying bacteria during n2o respiration.

(1984) biochemistry 23, 6345-6349], we have measured the rate constants as a function of ionic strength for electron transfer from the semiquinones of clostridium mp, anacystis nidulans, and azotobacter vinelandii flavodoxins to the following oxidants: cytochrome c from tuna and horse, paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c2, pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c-551,  and ferricyanide. the rate constants extrapolated to infinite ionic strength (k infinity) for the c. mp flavodoxin are all slightly smaller than for the c. pasteurianum flavodoxin, as would be predicted on the basis of the higher redox potential of the c. mp protein. this indicates that there is a close similarity between the surface topographies of the two proteins in the vicinity of the coenzyme binding site. moreover, the electrostatic interactions between the two flavodoxins and the various oxidants are also approximately the same. these studies justify our previous use of the crystallographic structure of the c. mp flavodoxin to interpret kinetic results obtained with the structurally uncharacterized c. pasteurianum flavodoxin. despite their lower redox potentials, both anacystis and azotobacter flavodoxins are appreciably less reactive toward all of these oxidants (as much as 2 orders of magnitude in some cases) than are the clostridium flavodoxins.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == analysis of cytochromes c (tuna), c2 (rhodospirillum rubrum), c550 (paracoccus denitrificans) and c551 (pseudomonas aeruginosa) shows that they contain 48 residues identifiable as homologous from superposition of the structures. the other 34 to 64 residues are in loops that vary greatly in sequence, length and conformation, or in alpha-helices that are found in only some of the structures.  of the 48 homologous residues, 17 are in three segments which pack onto the haem  faces. in all four structures, these segments have the same conformations, and the same locations relative to the haem. the other 31 residues are in three alpha-helices which are in contact with each other. these form the back and one side of the haem pocket. in cytochrome c551 the positions of the three alpha-helices have shifted and rotated, in comparison with cytochromes c and c2,  by up to 5 a and 25 degrees relative to the haem. these shifts, facilitated by mutations at the helix-helix interfaces, are related to the reconstruction of the propionic acid side of the haem pocket described by almassy & dickerson (1978). together these effects produce alternative structures for the haem pocket. this mechanism of adaptation to mutation contrasts with that observed in the globins.  in the globins, mutations also produce changes in helix interfaces and shifts of  packed helices, but in the globins these shifts are coupled to conserve the structure of the haem pocket.

AB  == the denitrification of nitrites and nitrates (1000 mg n/l) in medium containing methanol as a source of organic carbon was studied. continuous cultures of mixed  population of autochtonic microflora from bottom sludge of nitrogenous wastewater reservoir were set up in a chemostat-type column and packed bed reactor. the efficiency of denitrification of nitrates in packed bed reactor was 506.7 mg n/l/h whereas denitrification of nitrites was from 8.7 to 16.0 mg n/l/h depending on the granulation of the filing material. in the latter case 83% nitrogen was removed from the medium. one of the factors causing low efficiency of denitrification of nitrites is excessive alkalization of the medium in the bed. the use of a three-step bed with adjusted ph resulted in complete denitrification of nitrites with efficiency 60 mg n/l/h. the bacteria inside the bed were dominated by paracoccus denitrificans and by pseudomonas aeruginosa when nitrates were present. the sensitivity of p. denitrificans to high concentrations of nitrites seems to be the second factor contributing to low efficiency of denitrification with methanol as organic substrate.

AB  == product inhibition has been examined in the turnover kinetics of cytochrome cd1 from pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 19429) and from paracoccus denitrificans1 (atcc 13456). a common characteristic was a decrease in rate during the time course of  assays that was not due to substrate depletion or irreversible inactivation. the  product of nitrite reduction, nitric oxide (no), acted as a product inhibitor in  anaerobic assays with an apparent ki of 0.2 microm, but only if the enzyme was first preincubated with no for 15 min. the enzyme was inhibited by the oxidized form of electron donors and this could account for the decrease in rate during an assay. for the donors hydroquinone, ascorbate, tmpd, and azurin, measured values  of the inhibition constant were at least ten fold lower than measured km's. cytochromes c as donors demonstrated a complex pattern of product inhibition by the ferric form. although numerical values of ki in these cases were not obtained, trends indicated that apparent values would be less than km.

TI  == heterotrophic nitrification among denitrifiers.
AB  == twelve denitrifying bacteria representing six genera were tested for an ability to nitrify pyruvic oxime heterotrophically. six of these bacteria exhibited appreciable nitrification activity, yielding as much as 5.8 mm nitrite and little or no nitrate when grown in a mineral salts medium containing 7 mm pyruvic oxime  and 0.05% yeast extract. of the six active bacteria, four (pseudomonas denitrificans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of pseudomonas fluorescens) could grow on yeast extract but not pyruvic oxime, one (pseudomonas  aureofaciens) could grow slowly on pyruvic oxime, and one (alcaligenes faecalis)  could apparently grow on pyruvic oxime in the presence of yeast extract but not in its absence. eight of the twelve bacteria in the resting state could oxidize hydroxylamine to nitrite, and p. aureofaciens was remarkably active in this regard. in general, those denitrifiers active in the nitrification of pyruvic oxime or hydroxylamine or both are abundant in soils. a possible advantage of having nitrification and denitrification capabilities in the same organism is discussed.

TI  == denitrification and nitrite reduction: pseudomonas aeruginosa nitrite-reductase.
AB  == present knowledge of the different enzymatic steps of the denitrification chains  in various bacteria, particularly paracoccus denitrificans and pseudomonas aeruginosa has been briefly reviewed. the question whether nitric oxide (no), nitrous oxide (n2o) and other nitrogen derivatives are obligatory intermediates has been discussed. the second part is an extensive review of the structure and the function of a key enzyme in denitrification, cytochrome c551-nitrite-oxidoreductase from p. aeruginosa. recent results on the stoichiometry of nitrite reduction have been discussed.

TI  == proposed structure for the noncovalently associated heme prosthetic group of dissimilatory nitrite reductases. identification of substituents.
AB  == the substituents of the noncovalently associated heme prosthetic group of the bacterial nitrite reductase-cytochrome oxidase (ec 1.9.6.1 or ec 1.9.3.2.) from pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 19429) and paracoccus denitrificans (atcc 13456) have been identified. this was accomplished by 1h nmr, infrared, visible, and mass spectroscopic techniques applied to semi-purified heme and purified methyl ester derivatives of the iron-free porphyrin. the main structural features are as follows. 1) the macrocycle is a reduced porphyrin of the chlorin type, that is, one of the pyrrole rings has been saturated so that the beta-carbons have sp3-hybridization. 2) the chlorin is a tetracarboxylic acid. 3) the substituents  of the saturated pyrrole ring are two methyl groups and two hydroxymethyl groups. 4) the substituents of the unsaturated pyrrole rings are: (i) two methyl groups (ii) a propionic acid (iii) an acrylic acid, and (iv) two directly bonded formic  acid groups. no firm evidence has been obtained for the relative positions of these unsaturated beta-pyrrolic substituents around the macrocyclic ring, but a proposed structure will be discussed. several previously inexplicable chemical properties of the heme in extracts or in the intact enzyme can be now interpreted in view of the proposed structure. the trivial name "acrylochlorin" is suggested  for the macrocycle.

TI  == comparison of denitrification by pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == a comparison was made of denitrification by pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and paracoccus denitrificans. although all three organisms reduced nitrate to dinitrogen gas, they did so at different rates and accumulated different kinds and amounts of intermediates. their rates of anaerobic growth on  nitrate varied about 1.5-fold; concomitant gas production varied more than 8-fold. cell yields from nitrate varied threefold. rates of gas production by resting cells incubated with nitrate, nitrite, or nitrous oxide varied 2-, 6-, and 15-fold, respectively, among the three species. the composition of the gas produced also varied markedly: pseudomonas stutzeri produced only dinitrogen; pseudomonas aeruginosa and paracoccus denitrificans produced nitrous oxide as well; and under certain conditions pseudomonas aeruginosa produced even more nitrous oxide than dinitrogen. pseudomonas stutzeri and paracoccus denitrificans  rapidly reduced nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide and were able to grow anaerobically when any of these nitrogen oxides were present in the medium. pseudomonas aeruginosa reduced these oxides slowly and was unable to grow anaerobically at the expense of nitrous oxide. furthermore, nitric and nitrous oxide reduction by pseudomonas aeruginosa were exceptionally sensitive to inhibition by nitrite. thus, although it has been well studied physiologically and genetically, pseudomonas aeruginosa may not be the best species for studying  the later steps of the denitrification pathway.

TI  == effect of various sources of organic carbon and high nitrite and nitrate concentrations on the selection of denitrifying bacteria. ii. continuous cultures in packed bed reactors.
AB  == the effect of different organic compounds, nitrites and nitrates at the concentration of 1,000 mg n/l on the quantitative and strain-specific selection of denitrifying bacteria was determined in anaerobic packed bed reactors. both the source of carbon and nitrogen form influenced strain specificity and the frequency of occurrence of denitrifying bacteria. the frequency of denitrifying bacteria within packed bed reactor ranged in different media from 11% (glucose and nitrates) to 100% (methanol and ethanol with nitrates). a single species selection was observed in the presence of nitrites within packed bed reactor: pseudomonas aeruginosa in medium with acetate. pseudomonas stutzeri in medium with ethanol, pseudomonas mendocina in medium with methanol and pseudomonas fluorescens in medium with glucose. when nitrates were present in packed bed reactor, the dominating bacteria were: p. stutzeri in medium with acetate, p. fluorescens in medium with ethanol, paracoccus denitrificans in medium with methanol and alcaligenes faecalis in medium with glucose.

TI  == the pathway of nitrogen and reductive enzymes of denitrification.
AB  == some recent studies on the pathway of nitrogen and the reductases of denitrification are reviewed. the available evidence suggests that while the intermediates of denitrification can remain enzyme-bound (presumably to nitrite reductase) prior to formation of n2o, no and nitroxyl (hno) can be released in part by certain bacteria. release of no is recognized by a nitrite/no-15n exchange reaction and isotopic scrambling in product n2o; release of nitroxyl by  pseudomonas stutzeri is recognized by isotopic scrambling of nitrite and no in product n2o in absence of exchange and affords evidence that the first n-n bond forms in denitrification at the n1+ redox level. the recent purification and partial characterization of nitrous oxide reductase are described. the ability of the dissimilatory nitrite reductase to activate nitrite for nitrosyl transfer affords a new chemical probe into the mechanism of action of this central enzyme. it would appear that reduction of nitrite is subject to electrophilic catalysis.  18o studies show that dissociation of nitrite from nitrite reductase can be slow  relative to competing reduction or nitrosyl transfer.

TI  == inhibition, but not uncoupling, of respiratory energy coupling of three bacterial species by nitrite.
AB  == the effect of nitrite on respiratory energy coupling of three bacteria was studied in light of a recent report that nitrite acted as an uncoupling agent with paracoccus denitrificans grown under denitrifying conditions. our determinations of proton translocation stoichiometry of pseudomonas putida (aerobically grown), pseudomonas aeruginosa, and p. denitrificans (grown both aerobically and under denitrifying conditions) showed nitrite inhibition of proton-to-oxidant stoichiometry, but not uncoupling. nitrite both reduced the h+/o ratio and decreased the rate of proton resorption. increased proton resorption rates, characteristic of authentic uncoupling agents, were not observed. the lack of enhanced proton permeability due to nitrite was verified via passive proton permeability assays. the h+/o ratio of p. aeruginosa increased when growth conditions were changed from aerobic to denitrifying. this suggested  the induction of an additional coupling site in the electron transport chain of denitrifying p. aeruginosa.

AB  == plasmid r68.45 mediates the transfer of kanamycin resistance from pseudomonas aeruginosa to paracoccus denitrificans. kanamycin resistance could be transferred from one strain of p. denitrificans to another, thus opening up the possibility of using r68.45 as a sex factor in p. denitrificans.

TI  == metal accumulation by bacteria with particular reference to dissimilatory sulphate-reducing bacteria.
AB  == dissimilatory sulphate-reducing bacteria, genera desulfovibrio and desulfotomaculum, exhibit a superior ability, over assimilatory organisms, to extract three amounts of metals from culture media. this property does not appear to be solely a function of the presence of h2s. in media containing elevated amounts of fe, electron dense particles, provisionally identified as fes, are deposited within the cells of dissimilatory bacteria.
