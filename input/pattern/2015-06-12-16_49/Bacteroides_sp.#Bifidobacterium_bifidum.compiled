TI  - Polysaccharide from seeds of Plantago asiatica L. affects lipid metabolism and colon microbiota of mouse.
AB  - Polysaccharide from the seeds of Plantago asiatica L. was given via oral administration to mice (0.4 g/kg body weight, 30 days) to observe its effects on mouse nutrient metabolism and colon microbiota. It was found the polysaccharide intake could lower the apparent absorption of lipid. Total triglyceride, cholesterol, and atherogenic index in blood serum with total lipid and cholesterol levels in liver of polysaccharide group mice were all significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the effect of the polysaccharide intake on mouse colon bacterial communities was investigated. Mice from the polysaccharide group showed a higher colon bacterial diversity than the control group. Bacteroides sp., Eubacterium sp., butyrate-producing bacteria Butyrivibrio sp., and probiotics Bifidobacterium bifidum , Lactobacillus fermentum , and Lactobacillus reuteri in mouse colon were all increased after polysaccharide intake. These indicated that the intake of polysaccharide from P. asiatica L. could be beneficial for lipid metabolism and colon microbiota.
TI  - The beneficial effect of exopolysaccharides from Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 on microbial diversity in mouse intestine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The structure of exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by Bifidobacterium and their beneficial effects on human health have been fully studied, but only a few studies have investigated their influence on microbial diversity in the human/animal intestine. RESULTS: The strain named Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (EPS) yield was selected to study the effect of its EPS on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. The results indicated that EPS significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis indicated that the EPS significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. When receiving a low dose of EPS, Bacteroidales sp./Lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and L. johnsonii, L. animalis and L. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a high concentration of EPS. CONCLUSION: The combination of viable cell count, DGGE and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of EPS from B. bifidum WBIN03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health of their hosts.
TI  - The intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  - Bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. In infants delivered by Caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. The first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. Among them, Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from the newborn faecal flora at birth. Facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by Bifidobacterium sp. Clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a Caesarean section. Clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as Bacteroides and other Clostridium sp. The impact of Caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. Feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. In humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. Formula feeding seems to promote implantation and persistence of Clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of C. difficile in newborns.
TI  - Analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  - A 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. The blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. The decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. The dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was Bifidobacterium sp., Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lonqum, Lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Peptococcus magnus Bifidobacterium longum. In contrast, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides distasonis, B. ovatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. Among microorganisms isolated from the patient, Morganella morganii, Candida sp., Eubacterium aerofacience and Eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; Streptococcus mitior, Staphylococcus intermedius, Micrococcus kristinae, Selenomonas ruminantum, Bacteroides ureolyticus and Lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. These results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.
TI  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. Of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). The Bifidobacterium spp. most frequently isolated from the three groups of infants were B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum. The bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were B. fragilis and B. vulgatus. The most common Clostridium sp. in the three groups of infants was C. perfringens. The type of milk did not select for species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Clostridium, except for Clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and Clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. The species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
