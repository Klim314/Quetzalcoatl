TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against 923 anaerobes isolated from human intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against 923 recent anaerobic isolates obtained from pretreatment cultures in patients with complicated intra-abdominal  infections was studied using the clsi m11-a-6 agar dilution method. moxifloxacin  was active against 87% (96 of 110) bacteroides fragilis strains at < or = 1 microg/ml and 87% (79 of 90) b. thetaiotaomicron strains at < or = 2 microg/ml. species variation was seen, with b. uniformis, b. vulgatus, clostridium clostridioforme, and c. symbiosum being least susceptible and accounting for most of the resistant isolates; excluding the aforementioned four resistant species, 86% (303 of 363) of bacteroides species isolates and 94% (417 of 450) of all other genera and species were susceptible to < or = 2 microg/ml of moxifloxacin.  overall, moxifloxacin was active against 763 of 923 (83%) of strains at < or = 2  microg/ml, supporting its use as a monotherapy for some community-acquired intra-abdominal infections.
