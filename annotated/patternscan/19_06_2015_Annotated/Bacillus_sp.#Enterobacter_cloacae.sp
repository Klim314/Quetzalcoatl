TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a wwtp.
AB  == the microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. this fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli (three strains), enterobacter cloacae, kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), kluyvera intermedia, citrobacter freundii (two strains), bacillus sp. and enterobacter sp. the first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.l(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees c). the results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.l(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees c for 30 min. the other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.l(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). the results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the cfu.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  cfu observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (sp). methods and results: following the  inconsistent results, cfu estimations were undertaken through conventional sp using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. the latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (ss)] yielded higher cfu by 11-120%  over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. the adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter cloacae and bacillus pumilus. plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% cfu owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. on the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the cfu significantly. spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while bacillus spores were less affected. conclusions: the study brings out that the way sp is carried  out exerts significant effects on cfu influenced by plate conditions. prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. a mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of ss not involving the spreader is recommended. significance and impact of the study: this study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial  cells and the cfu and recommends an alternate approach of ss to minimize cfu inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.

TI  == enhancing biodegradation of wastewater by microbial consortia with fractional factorial design.
AB  == batch experiments were conducted on the degradation of synthetic and municipal wastewater by six different strains, i.e., agrobacterium sp., bacillus sp., enterobacter cloacae, gordonia, pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas putida. by applying a fractional factorial design (ffd) of experiments, the influence of each strain and their interactions were quantified. an empirical model predicting the treatment efficiency was built based on the results of the ffd experiments with an r(2) value of 99.39%. for single strain, enterobacter cloacae, gordonia and p. putida (p=0.008, 0.009 and 0.023, respectively) showed significant enhancement on organic removal in the synthetic wastewater. positive interaction  from enterobacter cloacae, gordonia (p=0.046) was found, indicating that syntrophic interaction existed, and their coexistence can improve total organic carbon (toc) degradation. verification experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of bioaugmentation by introducing three selected strains into an activated sludge reactor for treating municipal wastewater. the removal efficiency of toc with the bioaugmentation was increased from 67-72% to 80-84% at an influent toc concentration of 200mg/l. the results derived from this study indicate that the ffd is a useful screening tool for optimizing the microbial community to enhance  treatment efficiency.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 used for fermentation of air-dried crop straws].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 in fermented crop straw. methods: total 13 isolates were obtained from spontaneous fermented rice straw by plating, paper diffusion and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis. all these strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of sfc-2. results: (1) phylogenetic analysis of the 13 strains based on 16s rdna gene sequence data indicated that 9 strains belong to enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacterfreundii, klebsiella terrigena and citrobacter sp., which were all common pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. (2) indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of sfc-2 cell-free  culture supernatant. the results showed that: sfc-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from sfc-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from  the culture of sfc-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease k.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  == the diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of eudrilus eugeniae, lampito mauritii, eisenia fetida and perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. while actinomycetes (streptomyces albus, s. somaliensis, nocardia asteroides, n. caviae and saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (amoeba proteus, a. terricola, paramecium trichium, euglena viridis, e.  orientalis, vorticella picta and trichomonas hominis) and yeast (candida tropicalis, c. krusei c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. certain species of fungi (saksenae vasiformis, mucor plumbeus, cladosporium carrionii, c. herbacium, alternaria sp., cunninghamella echinulata,  mycetia sterila, syncephalostrum racemosum, curvalaria lunata, c. geniculata and  geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterium antitratum,  mima polymorpha, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri, escherichia coli, staphylococus citreus, bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococci and micrococci) were completely digested. certain other species were not digested fungi like aspergillus fumigatus, a. flavus, a. ochraceous, trichoderma koningii (except by eeugeniae), fusarium moniliforme (except by e. eugeniae) and rhizopus sp., and bacteria like klebsiella pneumoniae and morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. the microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in  the casts.

TI  == screening for anti-infective properties of several medicinal plants of the mauritians flora.
AB  == several plants of the mauritian flora alleged to possess anti-infective properties were studied against different strains of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. the grounded dried plant materials were extracted with different extractants and screened for anti-microbial activity using the disk diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques. preliminary screening revealed that the methanol extracts were most active. salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae and bacillus subtilis were the three test organisms, which were found to be susceptible to all the crude methanolic extracts of the different plants investigated (100% susceptibility), followed by escherichia coli (57.1%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.1%), and staphylococcus aureus (28.6%). the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration recorded for the different crude methanol extracts against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis and the mould fungus candida albicans were 500, 1000, 125, 250, 1000 and 125 micro g/ml, respectively. bioautography using cladosporium cucumerinum revealed that dichloromethane (dcm) extracts had the highest activity against the phytopathogenic fungus. it was also noted that the dcm extracts of michelia champaca and antidesma madagascariense yielded the maximum number of growth inhibiting compounds against cladosporium cucumerinum. activity of the different crude extracts was also investigated against several phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, colletotrichum glocosporoides, rhizoctonia solani, sclerotinia sclerotium, guignardia sp. and fusarium oxysporum. it was found that crude hexane extracts as well as crude dcm extracts exhibited marked activity against several strains of fungi, especially colletotrichum glocosporoides, sclerotinia sclerotium and guignardia sp.

TI  == rapid, specific and quantitative assays for the detection of the endophytic bacterium methylobacterium mesophilicum in plants.
AB  == xylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited bacterium that causes citrus variegated chlorosis disease in sweet orange. there is evidence that x. fastidiosa interacts with endophytic bacteria present in the xylem of sweet orange, and that these interactions, particularly with methylobacterium mesophilicum, may affect disease progress. however, these interactions cannot be evaluated in detail until efficient methods for detection and enumeration of these bacteria in planta are developed. we have previously developed standard and quantitative pcr-based assays specific for x. fastidiosa using the lightcycler system [li, w.b., pria jr., l.p.m.w.d., x. qin, and j.s. hartung, 2003. presence of xylella fastidiosa in sweet orange fruit and seeds and its transmission to seedlings. phytopathology 93:953-958.], and now report the development of both standard and quantitative pcr assays for m. mesophilicum. the assays are specific for m. mesophilicum and do not amplify dna from other species of methylobacterium or other bacteria commonly associated with citrus or plant tissue. other bacteria tested included curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, pantoea agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus sp., x. fastidiosa, xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus. we have demonstrated that with these methods we can quantitatively monitor the colonization of xylem by m. mesophilicum during the course of disease development in plants artificially inoculated with both bacteria.

TI  == distribution of genes encoding the microbial non-oxidative reversible hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases.
AB  == bacterial non-oxidative, reversible multi subunit hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases are encoded by the three clustered genes, b, c, and d, of approximately 0.6, 1.4, and 0.2 kb, respectively. there are more than 160 homologues in the database with significant similarity to gene b (homology to ubix) and c (ubid) distributed in all three microbial domains, however, homologues to gene d, are not numerous ( approximately 15). the occurrence of the entire bcd gene cluster encoding for either identified or presumptive hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase to date has been revealed in sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus (unique genes arrangement cdb), streptomyces sp. d7, bacillus subtilis, b. licheniformis, e. coli o157:h7, klebsiella pneumoniae,  enterobacter cloacae, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella enterica, s. paratyphi, s. typhimurium, s. bongori, and s. diarizonae. the corresponding genes from s. hydroxybenzoicus, b. subtilis, streptomyces sp. d7, e. coli o157:h7, k. pneumoniae, and s. typhimurium were cloned and expressed in e. coli dh5alpha (void of analogous genes), and shown to code for proteins exhibiting non-oxidative hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase activity.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == diversity of endophytic bacterial populations and their interaction with xylella  fastidiosa in citrus plants.
AB  == citrus variegated chlorosis (cvc) is caused by xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium that can infect all citrus sinensis cultivars. the endophytic bacterial communities of healthy, resistant, and cvc-affected citrus plants were studied by using cultivation as well as cultivation-independent techniques. the endophytic communities were assessed in surface-disinfected citrus branches by plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). dominant isolates were characterized by fatty-acid methyl ester analysis as bacillus pumilus, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium spp. (including methylobacterium extorquens, m. fujisawaense, m. mesophilicum, m. radiotolerans, and m. zatmanii), nocardia sp., pantoea agglomerans, and xanthomonas campestris. we observed a relationship between cvc symptoms and the frequency of isolation of species of methylobacterium, the genus that we most frequently isolated from symptomatic plants. in contrast, we isolated c. flaccumfaciens significantly more frequently from asymptomatic plants than from those with symptoms of cvc while p. agglomerans was frequently isolated from tangerine (citrus reticulata) and sweet-orange (c. sinensis) plants, irrespective of whether the plants were symptomatic or asymptomatic or showed symptoms of cvc. dgge analysis of 16s rrna gene fragments amplified from total plant dna resulted in several bands that matched those from the bacterial isolates, indicating that dgge profiles can be used to detect some endophytic bacteria of citrus plants. however, some bands had no match with any isolate, suggesting the occurrence of other, nonculturable or as yet uncultured, endophytic bacteria. a specific band with a high g+c ratio was observed only in asymptomatic plants. the higher frequency of c. flaccumfaciens in asymptomatic plants suggests a role for this organism in the resistance of plants to cvc.

TI  == kinetic study of two novel enantiomeric tricyclic beta-lactams which efficiently  inactivate class c beta-lactamases.
AB  == a detailed kinetic study of the interaction between two ethylidene derivatives of tricyclic carbapenems, lek 156 and lek 157, and representative beta-lactamases and d-alanyl-d-alanine peptidases (dd-peptidases) is presented. both compounds are very efficient inactivators of the enterobacter cloacae 908r beta-lactamase,  which is usually resistant to inhibition. preliminary experiments indicate that various extended-spectrum class c beta-lactamases (act-1, cmy-1, and mir-1) are also inactivated. with the e. cloacae 908r enzyme, complete inactivation occurs with a second-order rate constant, k(2)/k', of 2 x 10(4) to 4 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1), and reactivation is very slow, with a half-life of >1 h. accordingly, lek  157 significantly decreases the mic of ampicillin for e. cloacae p99, a constitutive class c beta-lactamase overproducer. with the other serine beta-lactamases tested, the covalent adducts exhibit a wide range of stabilities, with half-lives ranging from long (>4 h with the tem-1 class a enzyme), to medium (10 to 20 min with the oxa-10 class d enzyme), to short (0.2 to 0.4 s with the nmca class a beta-lactamase). by contrast, both carbapenems behave as good substrates of the bacillus cereus metallo-beta-lactamase (class b). the streptomyces sp. strain r61 and k15 extracellular dd-peptidases exhibit low levels of sensitivity to both compounds.

TI  == variability and interactions between endophytic bacteria and fungi isolated from  leaf tissues of citrus rootstocks.
AB  == fungi and bacteria were isolated from surface disinfected leaf tissues of several citrus rootstocks. the principal bacterial species isolated were alcaligenes sp., bacillus spp. (including b. cereus, b. lentus, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, and b.  subtilis), burkholderia cepacia, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium extorquens, and pantoea agglomerans, with p. agglomerans and b. pumilus being the most frequently isolated species. the most abundant fungal species were colletotrichum gloeosporioides, guignardia citricarpa, and cladosporium sp. genetic variability between 36 endophytic bacterial isolates was analysed by the random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) technique, which indicated that b. pumilus isolates were more diverse than p. agglomerans isolates, although genetic diversity was not related to the host plants. in vitro interaction studies between g. citricarpa isolates and the most  frequently isolated endophytic bacteria showed that metabolites secreted by g. citricarpa have an inhibitory growth effect on some bacillus species, and a stimulatory growth effect on p. agglomerans.

TI  == microbiological investigation on black crusts from open-air stone monuments of bologna (italy).
AB  == samples of black crusts taken from open-air stone monuments in bologna dating back to between the twelfth and the nineteenth century were considered. the microbiological test procedures isolated from a high number of chemoorganotrophic bacteria, each of the samples although it was expected to find chemo-lithotrophic (specially sulfur-oxidizing and nitrifying) bacteria on account of the great amounts of sulphur, carbon, nitrogen dioxides and ammonia in the air. sporogenous and asporogenous species were found among the isolated bacteria: the first were recognized as bacillus subtilis, bacillus brevis, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus mycoides and bacillus megaterium; the latter were corynebacterium glutamicum, actinomyces sp., alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, flavobacterium breve, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas stutzeri. these species were differently associated in the samples studied with a frequency of more than sixty-four per cent. this finding leads us  to believe that their presence in the black crusts is not occasional, but the result of an ecologically significant process of colonization. although behavioural tests (solubilization of calcium carbonate, of calcium sulphate and marble dust) did not reveal lithic activity among the bacteria studied, one can presume that their behaviour in nature - as a more or less complex microbial consortium - can be totally different and exert a decomposing action with regard  to several minerals, most of them acidify the media in which they develop.

TI  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (clms). the leakage of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., bacillus sp., a coryneform, staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (enterobacter cloacae nc1b 8151 and ent. aerogenes mb31) was studied. the rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm hg  than at atmospheric pressure. fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). the number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. the effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. cells from biofilms and monolayers of ac. calcoaceticus or staph. aureus attached to nylon (hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. the composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. the results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.

AB  == the membrane filter (mf) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified endo medium at 35 degrees c for 22 h. large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (spc) technique, can interfere with the detection of  coliforms on mf. this paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific spc bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on mf. pseudomonas aeruginosa and aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. the flavobacterium sp. and bacillus sp. selected for this study from spc did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. excessive crowding of e. coli and enterobacter cloacae colonies on mf also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. even when  there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the e. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified endo medium.

TI  == dinitrogen-fixing bacteria: computer-assisted identification of soil isolates.
AB  == dinitrogen-fixing (acetylene-reducing) bacteria may be readily isolated from soils but extensive biochemical or immunobiological testing, or both, are required to identify them absolutely. a computer-assisted scheme for identification of nine genera of dinitrogen-fixing bacteria was developed and tested. the computer program is based on interpretation of the 70 biochemical tests of the api 20e and 50e, supplemented with tests for acetylene reduction, nitrate and nitrite reduction, catalase, oxidase, motility, and growth on macconkey's bile salt medium. dinitrogen-fixing enterobacteriaceae (klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and erwinia herbicola) were accurately identified using the data base in the api analytical profile index. nonenteric dinitrogen-fixing bacteria (azotobacter spp., azospirillum spp., derxia sp., rhodospirillum sp., clostridium sp., and bacillus spp.) were subjected to these tests to form a new data base for these bacteria. the api tests agreed with standard biochemical tests commonly used to identify these bacteria, were reproducible with time, and were sufficiently unique to permit accurate identification of each species. the use of the api 20e and 50e tests plus the additional seven tests with these known data bases permitted rapid and precise identification of acetylene reducing bacteria from various agricultural ecosystems.

TI  == [kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
