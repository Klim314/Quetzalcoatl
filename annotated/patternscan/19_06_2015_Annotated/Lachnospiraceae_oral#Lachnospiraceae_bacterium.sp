TI  == effect of oral administration of metronidazole or prednisolone on fecal microbiota in dogs.
AB  == gastrointestinal microbiota have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various gastrointestinal disorders in dogs, including acute diarrhea and chronic enteropathy. metronidazole and prednisolone are commonly prescribed for the treatment of these diseases; however, their effects on gastrointestinal microbiota have not been investigated. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of these drugs on the gastrointestinal microbiota of dogs. metronidazole was administered twice daily at 12.5 mg/kg to a group of five healthy dogs, and prednisolone at 1.0 mg/kg daily to a second group of five healthy dogs for 14 days. fecal samples were collected before and after administration (day 0 and 14), and 14 and 28 days after cessation (day 28 and 42). dna was extracted, and the bacterial diversity and composition of each sample were determined based on 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequences using next-generation sequencing (illumina miseq). in the group administered metronidazole, bacterial diversity indices significantly decreased at day 14, and recovered after the cessation. principal coordinates analysis and hierarchical dendrogram construction based on unweighted and weighted unifrac distance matrices revealed that bacterial composition was also significantly altered by metronidazole at day 14 compared with the other time points. the proportions of bacteroidaceae, clostridiaceae, fusobacteriaceae, lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, turicibacteraceae, and veillonellaceae decreased, while bifidobacteriaceae, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcaceae, and streptococcaceae increased at day 14 and returned to their initial proportions by day 42. conversely, no effect of prednisolone was observed on either the bacterial diversity or composition. reducing pathogenic bacteria such as fusobacteria and increasing beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium through the administration of metronidazole may be beneficial for promoting gastrointestinal health; however, further investigations into the effects on diseased dogs are needed.

TI  == metabolomics analysis identifies intestinal microbiota-derived biomarkers of colonization resistance in clindamycin-treated mice.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota protect the host against enteric pathogens  through a defense mechanism termed colonization resistance. antibiotics excreted  into the intestinal tract may disrupt colonization resistance and alter normal metabolic functions of the microbiota. we used a mouse model to test the hypothesis that alterations in levels of bacterial metabolites in fecal specimens could provide useful biomarkers indicating disrupted or intact colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment. methods: to assess in vivo colonization resistance, mice were challenged with oral vancomycin-resistant enterococcus or clostridium difficile spores at varying time points after treatment with the lincosamide antibiotic clindamycin. for concurrent groups of antibiotic-treated mice, stool samples were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess changes in the microbiota and using non-targeted metabolic profiling. to assess whether the findings were applicable to another antibiotic class that suppresses intestinal anaerobes, similar experiments were conducted with piperacillin/tazobactam. results: colonization resistance began to recover within 5 days and was intact by 12 days after clindamycin treatment, coinciding with the recovery bacteria from the families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, both part of the phylum firmicutes. clindamycin treatment caused marked changes in metabolites present in fecal specimens. of 484 compounds analyzed, 146 (30%) exhibited a significant increase or decrease in concentration during clindamycin  treatment followed by recovery to baseline that coincided with restoration of in  vivo colonization resistance. identified as potential biomarkers of colonization  resistance, these compounds included intermediates in carbohydrate or protein metabolism that increased (pentitols, gamma-glutamyl amino acids and inositol metabolites) or decreased (pentoses, dipeptides) with clindamycin treatment. piperacillin/tazobactam treatment caused similar alterations in the intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolites. conclusions: recovery of colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment coincided with restoration of several fecal bacterial metabolites. these metabolites could provide useful biomarkers indicating intact or disrupted colonization resistance during and after antibiotic treatment.

TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == a phylogenomic view of ecological specialization in the lachnospiraceae, a family of digestive tract-associated bacteria.
AB  == several bacterial families are known to be highly abundant within the human microbiome, but their ecological roles and evolutionary histories have yet to be  investigated in depth. one such family, lachnospiraceae (phylum firmicutes, class clostridia) is abundant in the digestive tracts of many mammals and relatively rare elsewhere. members of this family have been linked to obesity and protection from colon cancer in humans, mainly due to the association of many species within the group with the production of butyric acid, a substance that is important for  both microbial and host epithelial cell growth. we examined the genomes of 30 lachnospiraceae isolates to better understand the origin of butyric acid capabilities and other ecological adaptations within this group. butyric acid production-related genes were detected in fewer than half of the examined genomes with the distribution of this function likely arising in part from lateral gene transfer (lgt). an investigation of environment-specific functional signatures indicated that human gut-associated lachnospiraceae possess genes for endospore formation, whereas other members of this family lack key sporulation-associated genes, an observation supported by analysis of metagenomes from the human gut, oral cavity, and bovine rumen. our analysis demonstrates that adaptation to an ecological niche and acquisition of defining functional roles within a microbiome can arise through a combination of both habitat-specific gene loss and lgt.

TI  == ecotoxicology inside the gut: impact of heavy metals on the mouse microbiome.
AB  == background: the gut microbiota is critical for intestinal homeostasis. recent studies have revealed the links between different types of dysbiosis and diseases inside and outside the intestine. environmental exposure to pollutants (such as heavy metals) can also impair various physiological functions for good health. here, we studied the impact of up to 8 weeks of oral lead and cadmium ingestion on the composition of the murine intestinal microbiome. results: pyrosequencing of 16s rna sequences revealed minor but specific changes in bacterial commensal communities (at both family and genus levels) following oral exposure to the heavy metals, with notably low numbers of lachnospiraceae and high numbers levels of lactobacillaceae and erysipelotrichaceacae (mainly due to changes in turicibacter spp), relative to control animals. conclusions: non-absorbed heavy metals have a direct impact on the gut microbiota. in turn, this may impact the alimentary tract and overall gut homeostasis. our results may enable more accurate assessment of the risk of intestinal disease associated with heavy metal ingestion.

TI  == bacterial community development in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == current knowledge of the microbial composition of dental plaque in early gingivitis is based largely on microscopy and cultural methods, which do not provide a comprehensive description of oral microbial communities. this study used 454-pyrosequencing of the v1-v3 region of 16s rrna genes (approximately 500  bp), and bacterial culture, to characterize the composition of plaque during the  transition from periodontal health to gingivitis. a total of 20 healthy volunteers abstained from oral hygiene for two weeks, allowing plaque to accumulate and gingivitis to develop. plaque samples were analyzed at baseline, and after one and two weeks. in addition, plaque samples from 20 chronic periodontitis patients were analyzed for cross-sectional comparison to the experimental gingivitis cohort. all of the healthy volunteers developed gingivitis after two weeks. pyrosequencing yielded a final total of 344,267 sequences after filtering, with a mean length of 354 bases, that were clustered into an average of 299 species-level operational taxonomic units (otus) per sample. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots revealed significant shifts in the bacterial community structure of plaque as gingivitis was induced, and community diversity increased significantly after two weeks. changes in the relative abundance of otus during the transition from health to gingivitis were correlated to bleeding on probing (bop) scores and resulted in the identification of new health- and gingivitis-associated taxa. comparison of the healthy volunteers to the periodontitis patients also confirmed the association of a number of putative periodontal pathogens with chronic periodontitis. taxa associated with gingivitis included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, lachnospiraceae [g-2] sp. hot100, lautropia sp. hota94, and prevotella oulorum, whilst rothia dentocariosa was associated with periodontal health. further study  of these taxa is warranted and may lead to new therapeutic approaches to prevent  periodontal disease.

TI  == intestinal microbiota of gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio) and its origin as revealed by 454 pyrosequencing.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention, as it influences growth, feed conversion, epithelial development, immunity as well as the intrusion of pathogenic microorganisms in the intestinal tract. in this study, pyrosequencing was used to explore the bacterial community of the intestine in gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio), and the origin of these microorganisms. the results disclosed great bacterial diversities in the carp intestines and cultured environments. the gibel carp harbored characteristic intestinal microbiota, where proteobacteria were predominant, followed by firmicutes. the analysis on the 10 most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units (otus) revealed a majority of firmicutes in the intestinal content (by decreasing order: veilonella sp., lachnospiraceae, lactobacillales, streptococcus sp., and lactobacillus sp.). the second most abundant otu was rothia sp. (actinobacteria). the most likely potential probiotics (lactobacillus sp., and bacillus sp.) and opportunists (aeromonas sp., and acinetobacter sp.) were not much abundant. bacterial community comparisons showed that the intestinal community was closely  related to that of the sediment, indicating the importance of sediment as source  of gut bacteria in gibel carp. however, 37.95 % of the otus detected in feed were retrieved in the intestine, suggesting that food may influence markedly the microbiota of gibel carp, and therefore may be exploited for oral administration  of probiotics.

TI  == stomatobaculum longum gen. nov., sp. nov., an obligately anaerobic bacterium from the human oral cavity.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic gram-stain-variable but positive by structure, non-spore-forming bacterium designated lachnospiraceae bacterium acc2 strain dsm  24645(t) was isolated from human subgingival dental plaque. bacterial cells were  4-40 microm long non-motile rods, often swollen and forming curved filaments up to 200 microm. cells contained intracellular, poorly crystalline, nanometre-sized iron- and sulfur-rich particles. the micro-organism was able to grow on yeast extract, trypticase peptone, milk, some sugars and organic acids. the major metabolic end-products of glucose fermentation were butyrate, lactate, isovalerate and acetate. the growth temperature and ph ranges were 30-42 degrees  c and 4.9-7.5, respectively. major fatty acids were c14 : 0, c14 : 0 dma (dimethyl aldehyde), c16 : 0, c16 : 1omega7c dma. the whole-cell hydrolysate contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, indicating peptidoglycan type a1gamma. the dna g+c content was calculated to be 55.05 mol% from the whole-genome sequence and 55.3 mol% as determined by hplc. there were no predicted genes responsible for biosynthesis of respiratory lipoquinones, mycolic acids and lipopolysaccharides. genes associated with synthesis of teichoic and lipoteichoic acids, diaminopimelic acid, polar lipids and polyamines were present. according to the 16s rrna gene sequence phylogeny, strain dsm 24645(t) formed, together with several uncultured oral clones, a separate branch within the family lachnospiraceae, with the highest sequence similarity to the type strain of moryella indoligenes at 94.2 %. based on distinct phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, we suggest that strain dsm 24645(t) represents a novel species in a new genus, for which the name stomatobaculum longum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain of stomatobaculum longum is dsm 24645(t) ( = hm-480(t); deposited in bei resources, an nih collection managed by the atcc).

TI  == composition of the adult digestive tract bacterial microbiome based on seven mouth surfaces, tonsils, throat and stool samples.
AB  == background: to understand the relationship between our bacterial microbiome and health, it is essential to define the microbiome in the absence of disease. the digestive tract includes diverse habitats and hosts the human body's greatest bacterial density. we describe the bacterial community composition of ten digestive tract sites from more than 200 normal adults enrolled in the human microbiome project, and metagenomically determined metabolic potentials of four representative sites. results: the microbiota of these diverse habitats formed four groups based on similar community compositions: buccal mucosa, keratinized gingiva, hard palate; saliva, tongue, tonsils, throat; sub- and supra-gingival plaques; and stool. phyla initially identified from environmental samples were detected throughout this population, primarily tm7, sr1, and synergistetes. genera with pathogenic members were well-represented among this disease-free cohort. tooth-associated communities were distinct, but not entirely dissimilar,  from other oral surfaces. the porphyromonadaceae, veillonellaceae and lachnospiraceae families were common to all sites, but the distributions of their genera varied significantly. most metabolic processes were distributed widely throughout the digestive tract microbiota, with variations in metagenomic abundance between body habitats. these included shifts in sugar transporter types between the supragingival plaque, other oral surfaces, and stool; hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide production were also differentially distributed. conclusions: the microbiomes of ten digestive tract sites separated into four types based on composition. a core set of metabolic pathways was present across these diverse digestive tract habitats. these data provide a critical baseline for future studies investigating local and systemic diseases affecting human health.

TI  == the subgingival microbiota of papillon-lefevre syndrome.
AB  == background: there is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. this comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with pls used 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) clonal analysis and the 16s rrna-based human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: thirteen patients with pls from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic dna was extracted. the 16s rrna genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the homim. results: the most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lachnospiraceae ot 100 (ei074), parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. as a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. in the homim analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with pls. of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. the high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., capnocytophaga granulosa, g. morbillorum, p. micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, streptococcus spp., and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the subgingival microbiota in pls is diverse.  periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development  of severe periodontitis in patients with pls.

TI  == deglycosylation of puerarin and other aromatic c-glucosides by a newly isolated human intestinal bacterium.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota may influence the fate of bioactive polyphenols,  such as the isoflavone puerarin (daidzein 8-c-glucoside), following their oral intake. faecal suspensions from 19 healthy subjects were tested for their ability to c-deglycosylate puerarin. only one of these catalysed this reaction. a rod-shaped gram-positive bacterium, strain cg19-1, capable of deglycosylating puerarin to daidzein was isolated from the corresponding suspension. however, the strictly anaerobic isolate was unable to utilize puerarin as sole carbon and energy source nor any of the tested carbohydrates. comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis indicated that strain cg19-1 is a new species of the lachnospiraceae. strain cg19-1 also converted other aromatic c-glucosides in addition to puerarin. the xanthone c-glucoside mangiferin was deglycosylated to norathyriol. the flavone c-glucosides homoorientin and vitexin were degraded to 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid via luteolin and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid respectively. in addition, strain cg19-1 converted flavonoid o-glucosides, but at rates that were lower than those of the  c-glucosides tested. the isolate deglycosylated the isoflavone o-glucosides daidzin and genistin to daidzein and genistein respectively. several o-glucosides of the flavones luteolin and apigenin undergoing deglycosylation were subsequently cleaved to 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid respectively. moreover, strain cg19-1 cleaved both o-desmethylangolensin and 6'-hydroxy-o-desmethylangolensin to yield 2-(4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid. the corresponding cleavage product, resorcinol, was only observed for o-desmethylangolensin.

TI  == clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background/aims: severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. the aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. methods: dental  plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific pcr amplification for streptococcus mutans and bifidobacteriaceae species. results: children with severe caries (n =  39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16s rrna clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. using the human oral microbiome  database, 139 different taxa were identified. within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and veillonella sp. hot-780 (p < 0.01). the species associated with caries-free children included capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), lachnospiraceae sp. hot-100 (p < 0.05), streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). by specific pcr, s. mutans (p < 0.005) and bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. conclusion: clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the  association of s. mutans with caries was from specific pcr analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == lactobacilli are prominent in the initial stages of polymicrobial infection of dental pulp.
AB  == in earlier studies we used molecular methods to identify the major bacterial consortia associated with advanced dentin caries. these consortia are dominated by bacteria from the families lactobacillaceae, streptococcaceae, veillonellaceae (formerly acidaminococcaceae), eubacteriaceae, and lachnospiraceae from the phylum firmicutes; coriobacteriaceae, bifidobacteriaceae, and propionibacteriaceae from the phylum actinobacteria; and prevotellaceae from the  phylum bacteroidetes, as well as fusobacteria. the phases of infection of vital pulp tissue by dentin microorganisms remain obscure. in the present study, fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on sections of tissue embedded in resin. probes for 16s rrna corresponding to the major taxa of bacteria in carious dentin were used to provide information on the characteristics of pulp infection. lactobacilli were prominent in 7 of 8 pulps determined to be at a limited stage of infection. established infection (6 pulps) showed a more complex profile, with lactobacilli persisting in all of the lesions and with invasion of  the necrotic regions of tissue by bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, lachnospiraceae, and coriobacteriaceae in particular. advanced infections (7 pulps) were characterized by mixed anaerobic species, with a strong representation by coriobacteriaceae and lachnospiraceae. lactobacilli were not represented at this  stage. typically, groups of organisms were spatially isolated within the pulp tissue. analysis indicated that lactobacilli could invade vital pulp tissue to achieve a very high biomass that was not associated with a detectable local inflammatory infiltrate. the findings establish that invasion of the dental pulp  can be associated with a pronounced selection from the complex microbial populations within carious dentin, suggesting specific pathogenicity.

TI  == bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

TI  == molecular analysis of microbial diversity in advanced caries.
AB  == real-time pcr analysis of the total bacterial load in advanced carious lesions has shown that the total load exceeds the number of cultivable bacteria. this suggests that an unresolved complexity exists in bacteria associated with advanced caries. in this report, the profile of the microflora of carious dentine was explored by using dna extracted from 10 lesions selected on the basis of comparable total microbial load and on the relative abundance of prevotella spp.  using universal primers for the 16s rrna gene, pcr amplicons were cloned, and approximately 100 transformants were processed for each lesion. phylogenetic analysis of 942 edited sequences demonstrated the presence of 75 species or phylotypes in the 10 carious lesions. up to 31 taxa were represented in each sample. a diverse array of lactobacilli were found to comprise 50% of the species, with prevotellae also abundant, comprising 15% of the species. other taxa present in a number of lesions or occurring with high abundance included selenomonas spp., dialister spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium spp., members of the lachnospiraceae family, olsenella spp., bifidobacterium spp., propionibacterium sp., and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. the mechanisms by which such diverse patterns of bacteria extend carious lesions, including the aspect of infection of the vital dental pulp, remain unclear.
