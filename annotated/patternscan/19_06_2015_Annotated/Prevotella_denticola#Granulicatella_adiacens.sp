TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.
