TI  == influence of lactic acid bacteria on redox status and on proteolytic activity of  buckwheat (fagopyrum esculentum moench) sourdoughs.
AB  == redox potential and proteolysis determine protein networks in doughs and thus dough rheology as well as the structure of baked goods. namely, gluten-free bakery products needs structural improvements but little is known about these parameters in gluten free dough systems. in this work the influence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on redox status and proteolysis of buckwheat sourdoughs was investigated. an increase of free thiol groups was detected as redox potential was decreasing during fermentation. thiol content at 8 h was higher in doughs fermented with strains with high reductive activity, such as weissella (w.) cibaria in comparison to pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus, which exhibited a lower reducing activity. at 24 h each fermentation showed a similar content of free thiol groups. endogenous buckwheat proteases were characterized using various protease inhibitors in buckwheat doughs. until ph3.1 a proteolysis increase was monitored in doughs. employed lab didn't show any detectable extracellular proteolytic activity. flour proteases are thus responsible for protein breakdown, and this was demonstrated comparing free amino nitrogen (fan) values and protein  electrophoretic patterns of sourdough fermentations with chemical acidified (ca)  doughs. fan content at 24 h using p. pentosaceus, proteolytic comparative strain  of enterococcus faecalis, w. cibaria, mixed culture (containing p. pentosaceus and w. cibaria), ca and ca doughs containing glutathione (gsh) reached 45.9+/-1.3, 42.4+/-1.3, 40+/-1, 31+/-2, 29+/-2 and 17.8+/-3.9 mmol kg(-1) flour,  respectively. proteolysis was mainly influenced by ph and incubation time. the addition of gsh showed a decrease of proteolysis and of free amino acids. ca doughs showed a higher total free amino acids content than sourdough fermented with lab indicating their metabolization. fermentations with high fan values exhibited lower band intensity (analyzed under reducing condition) in electrophoretic patterns. these results show that dough proteases are responsible for proteolysis in buckwheat sourdoughs and this activity is influenced from lab  metabolism. moreover, oxidation-reduction potential (orp) changes do not show improvements of proteolytic activity in buckwheat sourdoughs.

TI  == antimicrobial activity, antibiotic susceptibility and virulence factors of lactic acid bacteria of aquatic origin intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.
AB  == background: the microorganisms intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture should exert antimicrobial activity and be regarded as safe not only for the aquatic hosts but also for their surrounding environments and humans. the objective of this work was to investigate the antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity  against fish pathogens, the antibiotic susceptibility, and the prevalence of virulence factors and detrimental enzymatic activities in 99 lactic acid bacteria (lab) (59 enterococci and 40 non-enterococci) isolated from aquatic animals regarded as human food. results: these lab displayed a broad antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity against the main gram-positive and gram-negative fish pathogens. however, particular safety concerns based on antibiotic resistance and virulence factors were identified in the genus enterococcus (86%) (enterococcus faecalis, 100%; e. faecium, 79%). antibiotic resistance was also found in the genera weissella (60%), pediococcus (44%), lactobacillus (33%), but not in leuconostocs and lactococci. antibiotic resistance genes were found in 7.5% of the non-enterococci, including the genera  pediococcus (12.5%) and weissella (6.7%). one strain of both pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella cibaria carried the erythromycin resistance gene mef(a/e), and another two p. pentosaceus strains harboured lnu(a) conferring resistance to lincosamides. gelatinase activity was found in e. faecalis and e. faecium (71 and 11%, respectively), while a low number of e. faecalis (5%) and none e. faecium exerted hemolytic activity. none enterococci and non-enterococci  showed bile deconjugation and mucin degradation abilities, or other detrimental enzymatic activities. conclusions: to our knowledge, this is the first description of mef(a/e) in the genera pediococcus and weissella, and lnu(a) in the genus pediococcus. the in vitro subtractive screening presented in this work  constitutes a valuable strategy for the large-scale preliminary selection of putatively safe lab intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of bacterial populations during spontaneous sorghum fermentations used to produce ting, a south african food.
AB  == ting is a spontaneously fermented sorghum food that is popular for its sour taste and unique flavour. insight of the microbial diversity and population dynamics during sorghum fermentations is an essential component of the development of starter cultures for commercial production of ting. in this study, bacterial populations associated with spontaneous sorghum fermentations were examined using a culture-independent strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons, and a culture-dependent strategy using conventional isolation based on culturing followed by 16s rrna and/or phes gene sequence analysis. the entire fermentation process was monitored over a 54 h period and two phases were observed with respect to ph evolution and  microbial succession. the first phase of the process (0-6h) was characterized by  relatively high ph conditions and the presence of enterococcus mundtii, albeit that this species was only detected with the culture-dependent approach. the second phase of the fermentation process (12-54 h) was characterized by increased acidity and the predominance of a broader range of lactic acid bacteria, including lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecalis, and a close relative of lactobacillus curvatus, as well as some members of the enterobacteriaceae family. the lb. curvatus-like species was only detected with pcr-dgge, while the majority of the other species was only detected using the culture-dependent approach. these findings highlighted the fact that a combination of both approaches was essential in revealing the microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations.

TI  == genotypic diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from african traditional alkaline-fermented foods.
AB  == aim: to identify and compare lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from alkaline fermentations of cassava (manihot esculenta crantz) leaves, roselle (hibiscus sabdariffa) and african locust bean (parkia biglobosa) seeds for production of, respectively, ntoba mbodi, bikalga and soumbala. methods and results: a total of  121 lab were isolated, identified and compared by phenotyping and genotyping using pcr amplification of 16s-23s rdna intergenic transcribed spacer (its-pcr),  repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) and dna sequencing. the results revealed  a diversity of genera, species and subspecies of lab in african alkaline fermentations. the isolates were characterized as nonmotile (in most cases) gram-positive rods, cocci or coccobacilli, catalase and oxidase negative. its-pcr allowed typing mainly at species level, with differentiation of a few bacteria at subspecies level. rep-pcr permitted typing at subspecies level and revealed significant genotypic differences between the same species of bacteria from different raw materials. dna sequencing combined with use of api 50chl and api 20strep systems allowed identification of bacteria as weissella confusa, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium and enterococcus hirae from ntoba mbodi; ent. faecium, ent. hirae and pediococcus acidilactici from bikalga and soumbala. conclusion: lab found in african alkaline-fermented foods belong to a range of genera, species and subspecies of bacteria and vary considerably according to raw material. significance and impact of the study: our study confirms that lab survive in alkaline fermentations, a first crucial stage in determining their significance and possible value as probiotic bacteria.

TI  == effect of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria starters on health-promoting and sensory properties of tomato juices.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus plantarum, weissella cibaria/confusa, lactobacillus brevis, pediococcus pentosaceous, lactobacillus sp. and enterococcus faecium/faecalis were identified from raw tomatoes by biolog system, partial 16s  rrna gene sequence and subjected to typing by random amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr) analysis. ten autochthonous strains were singly used to ferment tomato juice (tj) via a protocol which included fermentation at 25 degrees c for 17 h and further storage at 4 degrees c for 40 days. unstarted tj and tj fermented with an allochthonous strain of l. plantarum  were used as the controls. all autochthonous strains grew well in tj reaching cell densities ca. 10,000 and 10 times higher than unstarted tj and tj fermented  with the allochthonous strain. viscosity of tjs fermented with autochthonous strains was generally the highest, especially when started with w. cibaria/confusa which synthesized exo-polysaccharides. overall, unstarted tj and  tj fermented with the allochthonous strain showed marked decreases of ascorbic acid (asc), glutathione (gsh) and total antioxidant activity (tta) during storage. on the contrary, several tjs fermented with autochthonous strains, especially with l. plantarum pom1 and pom 35, maintained elevated values of asc,  gsh and taa. the variation of color indexes mirrored the above behavior. tjs fermented with the above two autochthonous strains were compared to controls based on volatile components through purge and trap or solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pt or spme-gc/ms) analysis. as shown by principal component analysis a large number of volatiles belonging to various chemical classes markedly differentiated tjs fermented with autochthonous strains with respect to controls.

TI  == identification of enterococcal, streptococcal and weissella species in the faecal flora of individually owned dogs.
AB  == aims: to improve the limited information on the composition of the faecal gram-positive coccal flora of healthy dogs by the use of a molecular identification method. methods and results: faecal swabs were collected for the selective isolation of gram-positive coccal strains. colonies with enterococcal-  and streptococcal-like morphology were identified by trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr). fourteen known species belonging to three genera (enterococcus, streptococcus and weissella) and one alleged new enterococcal species were found. conclusions: the faecal flora of dogs comprises  an unusually broad diversity of culturable gram-positive coccal species with enterococcus faecalis being most frequently present followed by not less than six other species of about equal importance. significance and impact of the study: many human- and animal-associated enterococci and streptococci are also present in dog faeces together with the largely uncharacterized weissella cibaria and a group of strains resembling enterococcus dispar, but representing a distinct and  hitherto unknown species. phenotypic characteristics of the latter two species were determined and the test results were compared with the species descriptions  of w. cibaria and e. dispar respectively.
