TI  == effects of two whole-grain barley varieties on caecal scfa, gut microbiota and plasma inflammatory markers in rats consuming low- and high-fat diets.
AB  == mixed-linkage beta-glucans are fermented by the colon microbiota that give rise to scfa. propionic and butyric acids have been found to play an important role in colonic health, as well as they may have extraintestinal metabolic effects. the aim of the present study was to investigate how two whole-grain barley varieties  differing in dietary fibre and beta-glucan content affected caecal scfa, gut microbiota and some plasma inflammatory markers in rats consuming low-fat (lf) or high-fat (hf) diets. barley increased the caecal pool of scfa in rats fed the lf  and hf diets compared with those fed the control diet, and the effect was generally dependent on fibre content, an exception was butyric acid in the lf setting. furthermore, whole-grain barley reduced plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, increased the caecal abundance of lactobacillus and decreased the bacteroides fragilis group, but increased the number of bifidobacterium only when dietary fat was consumed at a low level. fat content influenced the effects of barley: rats fed the hf diets had a higher caecal pool of acetic and propionic acids, higher concentrations of amino acids and higher amounts of lipids in the portal plasma and liver than rats fed the lf diets; however, less amounts of butyric acid were  generally formed. interestingly, there was an increase in the caecal abundance of akkermansia and the caecal pool of succinic acid, and a decrease in the proportion of bifidobacterium and the clostridium leptum group. in summary, whole-grain barley decreased hf diet-induced inflammation, which was possibly related to the formation of scfa and changes in microbiota composition. high beta-glucan content in the diet was associated with reduced plasma cholesterol levels.

TI  == comparative analysis of gastrointestinal microbiota between normal and caudal-related homeobox 2 (cdx2) transgenic mice.
AB  == background/aims: caudal-related homeobox 2 (cdx2) is expressed in the human intestinal metaplastic mucosa and induces intestinal metaplastic mucosa in the cdx2 transgenic mouse stomach. atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia commonly lead to gastric achlorhydria, which predisposes the stomach to bacterial overgrowth. in the present study, we determined the differences in gut microbiota between normal and cdx2 transgenic mice, using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr). methods: twelve normal (control) and 12 cdx2 transgenic mice were sacrificed, and the gastric, jejunal,  ileac, cecal and colonic mucosa, and feces were collected. to quantitate bacterial microbiota, we used real-time qrtpcr with 16s rrna gene-targeted, species-specific primers. results: the total numbers of bacteria in the gastric,  jejunal, ileac, cecal, and colonic mucosa of the cdx2 transgenic mice were significantly higher than those of the normal mice. the bacteroides fragilis group and also prevotella were not detected in the stomach of the normal mice, although they were detected in the cdx2 transgenic mice. moreover, the clostridium coccoides group, clostridium leptum subgroup, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella were not detected in the jejunum or ileum of the normal mice, although they were detected in the cdx2 transgenic mice. the fecal microbiota of the normal mice was similar to that of the cdx2 transgenic mice. conclusions: our results showed the differences in composition of gut microbiota  between normal and cdx2 transgenic mice, which may be caused by the development of gastric achlorhydria and intestinal metaplasia in cdx2 transgenic mice.

TI  == characterization of the gut microbiota of papua new guineans using reverse transcription quantitative pcr.
AB  == there has been considerable interest in composition of gut microbiota in recent years, leading to a better understanding of the role the gut microbiota plays in  health and disease. most studies have been limited in their geographical and socioeconomic diversity to high-income settings, and have been conducted using small sample sizes. to date, few analyses have been conducted in low-income settings, where a better understanding of the gut microbiome could lead to the greatest return in terms of health benefits. here, we have used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting dominant and sub-dominant groups of microorganisms associated with human gut microbiome in 115 people living a subsistence lifestyle in rural areas of papua new guinea. quantification of clostridium coccoides group, c. leptum subgroup, c. perfringens, bacteroides fragilis group, bifidobacterium, atopobium cluster, prevotella, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, staphylococcus, and lactobacillus spp. was conducted. principle coordinates analysis (pcoa) revealed two dimensions with prevotella, clostridia, atopobium, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus and staphylococcus grouping in one dimension, while b. fragilis, bifidobacterium and  lactobacillus grouping in the second dimension. highland people had higher numbers of most groups of bacteria detected, and this is likely a key factor for  the differences revealed by pcoa between highland and lowland study participants. age and sex were not major determinants in microbial population composition. the  study demonstrates a gut microbial composition with some similarities to those observed in other low-income settings where traditional diets are consumed, which have previously been suggested to favor energy extraction from a carbohydrate rich diet.

TI  == distinct gut microbiota of healthy children from two different geographic regions of thailand.
AB  == in thailand, food consumption by people from each region is different. this can be an important environmental factor which shapes the gut microbiota further affecting their health. this study aimed to use quantitative pcr (qpcr) to investigate the intestinal microbial community in 60 healthy children (aged 8-11  years) living in specific areas, namely central (ct) and northeastern (ne) thailand where each region has its own typical food consumption. the children from ne had significantly higher consumption frequency of meat (chicken and beef), a wide variety of carbohydrate sources (noodle, fermented rice and sweet potato) including vegetables and fruit, while in ct, there was a significant preference for rice, breakfast cereal and cow milk. the qpcr analysis resulted in significantly higher abundance of lactobacilli, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, clostridium leptum, prevotella and bacteroides fragilis in children from the ne region. however, no significant difference in the count of bifidobacterium spp., enterobacteriaceae and methanogens was observed. considering the correlation of food sources and microbial groups, the consumption frequency of vegetables showed a moderately positive correlation coefficient of 0.42 and 0.34  to the lactobacillus group (p = 0.001) and the prevotella group (p = 0.008), respectively, while a diet of fish and beef showed a moderately negative correlation coefficient of -0.41 (p = 0.001) and -0.33 (p = 0.09) to bifidobacterium spp., respectively. our results suggested that high frequency consumption of varieties of carbohydrates, protein sources, fruits and vegetables by the ne children promoted a high abundance of bacterial species in the phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes.

TI  == molecular monitoring of the development of intestinal microbiota in japanese infants.
AB  == the faecal microbiota of 166 healthy japanese newborns was analysed periodically  from day 1 after birth until the age of 3 years by using the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr. faecal ph and the organic acid concentration were also examined. colonisation by both facultative anaerobes and strict anaerobes was confirmed in 95% of the meconium tested. bifidobacterium-predominant microbiota was established subsequently in most of the infants by 3 months after  birth. bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium catenulatum group and bifidobacterium bifidum were the species mainly detected. intergroup correlation analysis revealed that the bifidobacterial population levels, but not other strict anaerobe groups, were found to be negatively correlated with those of the enterobacteriaceae from 7 days until 3 months after birth. faecal ph was maintained at about 6 until 6 months after birth and reached 6.6 at 3 years after birth. the initial concentration of faecal organic acids (19 mum/g of faeces) just after birth increased until 3 years after birth to the level of 111 mum/g of faeces. early start of feeding formula milk promoted colonisation by obligate anaerobes such as the clostridium coccoides group, the clostridium leptum subgroup, prevotella, and atopobium cluster during the 3 months after birth. population levels of the bifidobacteria until 1 month after birth and those of the bacteroides fragilis group until 6 months after birth were lower in infants delivered by caesarean section than in those delivered normally. the results suggested that both earlier start of feeding of formula milk and the mode of infant delivery were found to be important in the development of intestinal microbiota in early infancy.

TI  == a shift from colon- to ileum-predominant bacteria in ileal-pouch feces following  total proctocolectomy.
AB  == background: we previously investigated fecal flora of the pouch after total proctocolectomy using terminal restriction fragment polymorphism analysis. although the results of the cluster analysis demonstrated clearly that bacterial  populations, including an unidentified bacteria generating a 213-bp pcr fragment, moved toward a colon-like community in the pouch, it did not track changes in the individual species of fecal bacteria. aims: the aim of the present study was to estimate genome copy number of ten bacterial species, clusters, groups, or subgroups (including the bacteria generating 213-bp fragment in the previous study) in feces samples from pouches at various times following ileostomy closure. methods: a total of 117 stool samples were collected from patients with  ulcerative colitis after surgery as well as healthy volunteers. we used real-time polymerase chain reaction of the 16s rrna gene to estimate genome copy numbers for the nine bacterial populations and the bacteria generating 213-bp fragment after identification by dna sequencing. results: we demonstrated a time-dependent increase in the number of anaerobic and colon-predominant bacteria (such as clostridium coccoides, c. leptum, bacteroides fragilis and atopobium) present in  proctocolectomy patients after stoma closure. in contrast, numbers of ileum-predominant bacterial species (such as lactobacillus and enterococcus faecalis) declined. conclusions: our data confirm previous findings that fecal flora in the pouch after total proctocolectomy changes significantly, and further demonstrate that the number and diversity of ileal bacteria decreases while a more colon-like community develops. the present data are essential for the future analysis of pathological conditions in the ileal pouch.

TI  == interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the international obesity task force bmi criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr before and after the intervention. a group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant bmi (p=0.030) and bmi z-score (p=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. no significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. in the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased bacteroides fragilis group (p=0.001) and lactobacillus group (p=0.030) counts, and to decreased clostridium coccoides group (p=0.028), bifidobacterium longum (p=0.031), and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p=0.044) counts. in the high weight-loss group, b. fragilis group and lactobacillus group counts also increased (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively), whereas c. coccoides group and b. longum counts decreased (p=0.001 and p=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. total bacteria, b. fragilis group and clostridium leptum group, and bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts  were significantly higher (p<0.001-0.036) while levels of c. coccoides group, lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  bifidum were significantly lower (p<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. these findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be  influenced by the individual's microbiota.

TI  == establishment of an analytical system for the human fecal microbiota, based on reverse transcription-quantitative pcr targeting of multicopy rrna molecules.
AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) was established for the precise evaluation of human intestinal microbiota. group- and species-specific primer sets for clostridium perfringens,  lactobacillus spp. (six subgroups and three species), enterococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. targeting 16s rrna gene sequences were newly developed for the quantitative analysis of such subdominant populations in human intestines. they were used together with previously reported group-specific primer sets for enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp., and six predominant bacterial groups (the clostridium coccoides group, the clostridium leptum subgroup, the bacteroides fragilis group, bifidobacterium spp., the atopobium cluster, and prevotella spp.) for the examination of fecal samples from 40 healthy adults by rt-qpcr with lower detection limits of 10(2) to 10(4) cells per g of feces. the rt-qpcr method gave  data equivalent to those yielded by qpcr for predominant populations of more than 10(8) cells per g of feces and could quantify bacterial populations that were not detectable (staphylococcus and pseudomonas) or those only detected at lower incidences (prevotella, c. perfringens, lactobacillus, and enterococcus) by qpcr  or the culture method. the rt-qpcr analysis of lactobacillus spp. at the subgroup level revealed that a subject has a mean of 4.6 subgroups, with an average count  of log(10)(6.3 +/- 1.5) cells per g of feces. these results suggest that rt-qpcr  is effective for the accurate enumeration of human intestinal microbiota, especially the entire analysis of both predominant and subdominant populations.

TI  == imbalance in intestinal microflora constitution could be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == since genetically engineered animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) do not develop colitis under germ-free conditions, the intestinal microflora is thought to be one of the most important environmental factors associated with ibd. to understand the involvement of intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of ibd, we analyzed the constituents of intestinal microflora in ibd. faecal samples from 73 patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) and 23 patients with crohn's disease (cd) were analyzed by quantitative pcr using 16s rrna gene-targeted group-specific primers for bacteroides fragilis group, bifidobacterium, clostridium coccoides groups, clostridium leptum subgroup, atopobium cluster, and seven species of bacteroides. we analyzed the distribution of the predominant microflora by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) using  group-specific probes. we also examined the concentration of faecal organic acids produced by intestinal microflora. contrary to previous reports, we found that the b. fragilis group was significantly decreased in the faeces of patients with  ibd. moreover, b. vulgatus was the predominant microflora in healthy controls and relatively decreased among ibd patients. most of the microflora adhering to the colonic mucosa surrounding the mucus layer comprised c. coccoides group and bifidobacterium. b. fragilis group mainly inhabited the faeces, but did not adhere to or invade the mucosa. the concentrations of propionic and butyric acids in the faeces were significantly decreased in patients with ibd. these findings indicate that ibd is not caused by a specific intestinal bacterial cluster or species and that disordered intestinal microflora could be involved in the pathogenesis of ibd.

TI  == use of 16s rrna gene-targeted group-specific primers for real-time pcr analysis of predominant bacteria in human feces.
AB  == 16s rrna gene-targeted group-specific primers were designed and validated for specific detection and quantification of the clostridium leptum subgroup and the  atopobium cluster. to monitor the predominant bacteria in human feces by real-time pcr, we used these specific primers together with four sets of group-specific primers for the clostridium coccoides group, the bacteroides fragilis group, bifidobacterium, and prevotella developed in a previous study (t. matsuki, k. watanabe, j. fujimoto, y. miyamoto, t. takada, k. matsumoto, h. oyaizu, and r. tanaka, appl. environ. microbiol. 68:5445-5451, 2002). examination of dna extracted from the feces of 46 healthy adults showed that the c. coccoides group was present in the greatest numbers (log10 10.3 +/- 0.3 cells per g [wet weight] [average +/- standard deviation]), followed by the c. leptum subgroup (log10 9.9 +/- 0.7 cells per g [wet weight]), the b. fragilis group (log10 9.9 +/- 0.3 cells per g [wet weight]), bifidobacterium (log10 9.4 +/- 0.7 cells per g [wet weight]), and the atopobium cluster (log10 9.3 +/- 0.7 cells per g [wet weight]). these five bacterial groups were detected in all 46 volunteers. prevotella was found in only 46% of the subjects at a level of log10 9.7 +/- 0.8  cells per g (wet weight). examination of changes in the population and the composition of the intestinal flora for six healthy adults over an 8-month period revealed that the composition of the flora of each volunteer remained stable throughout the test period.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == development of 16s rrna-gene-targeted group-specific primers for the detection and identification of predominant bacteria in human feces.
AB  == for the detection and identification of predominant bacteria in human feces, 16s  rrna-gene-targeted group-specific primers for the bacteroides fragilis group, bifidobacterium, the clostridium coccoides group, and prevotella were designed and evaluated. the specificity of these primers was confirmed by using dna extracted from 90 species that are commonly found in the human intestinal microflora. the group-specific primers were then used for identification of 300 isolates from feces of six healthy volunteers. the isolates were clearly identified as 117 isolates of the b. fragilis group, 22 isolates of bifidobacterium, 65 isolates of the c. coccoides group, and 17 isolates of prevotella, indicating that 74% of the isolates were identified with the four pairs of primers. the remaining 79 isolates were identified by 16s ribosomal dna  sequence analysis and consisted of 40 isolates of collinsella, 24 isolates of the clostridium leptum subgroup, and 15 isolates of disparate clusters. in addition,  qualitative detection of these bacterial groups was accomplished without cultivation by using dna extracted from the fecal samples. the goal for this specific pcr technique is to develop a procedure for quantitative detection of these bacterial groups, and a real-time quantitative pcr for detection of bifidobacterium is now being investigated (t. requena, j. burton, t. matsuki, k.  munro, m. a. simon, r. tanaka, k. watanabe, and g. w. tannock, appl. environ. microbiol. 68:2420-2427, 2002). therefore, the approaches used to detect and identify predominant bacteria with the group-specific primers described here should contribute to future studies of the composition and dynamics of the intestinal microflora.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
