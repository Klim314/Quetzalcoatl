antimicrobial activity of the pleuromutilin antibiotic bc-3781 against bacterial  pathogens isolated in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program in 2010.
bc-3781 is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. bc-3781 has completed a phase 2 clinical trial in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi). its antibacterial spectrum additionally covers the predominant pathogens causing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). in this study, the antibacterial activity of bc-3781 was evaluated against a contemporary collection of 10,035 bacterial isolates predominately causing absssi and cabp, among other infections, collected within the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program worldwide in 2010. bc-3781 exhibited potent activity against organisms commonly isolated from absssi such as staphylococcus aureus (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 99.8% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic50/90, 0.03/0.03 mug/ml; 99.3% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml; 97.8% inhibited at </=1 mug/ml). bc-3781 displayed similar mic distributions among methicillin-susceptible (mssa) and methicillin-resistant (mrsa) s. aureus strains. bc-3781 was also active against enterococcus faecium, with 76.3% of vancomycin-susceptible and 97.0% of vancomycin-resistant isolates being inhibited at bc-3781 concentrations of </=1 mug/ml. beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci were highly susceptible to bc-3781, with 99.3% and 96.7% of isolates inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml, respectively. further, activity of bc-3781 against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic50/90, 1/2 mug/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) was not negatively influenced by beta-lactamase production or resistance to other antimicrobial classes tested. in all, bc-3781 displayed a very potent antibacterial profile including the most prevalent bacterial pathogens causing absssi and cabp, thus warranting further clinical development of this antibiotic in these and possibly other indications.
performance accuracy of antibacterial and antifungal susceptibility test methods: report from the college of american pathologists microbiology surveys program (2001-2003).
context: the college of american pathologists microbiology surveys program provides external proficiency samples that monitor the performance of nearly 3000 laboratories that perform and report antimicrobial susceptibility tests. objective: to summarize results obtained with bacterial and yeast challenge samples (2001 through 2003). design: one organism every 4 months was tested by surveys participants against antibacterials/antifungals by routinely used methods. reports were graded by interpretive category (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) based on an 80% consensus of referees/participants. results: the most common antibacterial test methods/systems were vitek (38%-43%), microscan (39%-43%), and the disk diffusion test (14%-15%), although etest was most used for fastidious species. yeastone was the dominant antifungal test (50%-55%). antifungal results demonstrated continuous, improved accuracy (83%-88%), highest for yeastone (96%) and broth microdilution (95%) methods. antibacterial test accuracy was consistently greater than 97% against gram-positive organism challenges and greater than 98% against gram-negative challenges. for gram-negative strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms, the accuracy by method was disk diffusion greater than broth microdilution greater than automated systems. major problems identified were (1) haemophilus influenzae control ranges require re-evaluation, (2) overuse of beta-lactamase tests, (3) errors among enterococcus faecium against penicillins (vitek 2, microscan), (4) false-susceptible results with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole against coagulase-negative staphylococci (microscan), (5) macrolide false-susceptibility for beta-hemolytic streptococcus (microscan), (6) flawed reporting for antimicrobials not active at the infection site, (7) use of outdated interpretive criteria, and (8) failure to follow clinical and laboratory standards institute testing/reporting recommendations. conclusions: susceptibility tests were generally performing satisfactorily as measured by the surveys, but serious errors were identified with some drug/organism combinations that may require action by the clinical and laboratory standards institute and/or the food and drug administration.
antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, lbm415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
objectives: to evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of lbm415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (pdfi) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (ussti), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. methods: a total of 21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons); resistance to penicillin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) among 18.0% of streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of haemophilus influenzae. results: lbm415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus faecium and moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/l; 97.0% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of h. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. seventy-seven percent of burkholderia cepacia and 82.0% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/l. no differences in lbm415 activity against s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and h. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. while regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to lbm415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. one isolate of s. aureus displayed high-level resistance to lbm415 owing to multiple sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defb and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. this isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. conclusions: with few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first pdfi class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. these compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. given the detection of a pre-existing pdfi-resistant isolate of s. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the pdfi-targeted pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will be an important component of future studies.
increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in korea: konsar study in 2001.
the 5th year konsar surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. it was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. resistance rates of gram-positive cocci were: 70% of staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. seventy-two percent of pneumococci were nonsusceptible to penicillin. the resistance rates of enterobacteriaceae were: escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. with the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.
in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in italy.
objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis in taiwan.
background: over the past decade, resistance of gram-positive cocci to common antibiotics has steadily increased. new antibacterial agents that are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens are urgently needed for the treatment of these pathogens. we conducted an in vitro study on the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics against common clinical isolates of the gram-positive cocci, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis. methods: the agar dilution method described by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of bacterial isolates from clinical specimens obtained from patients in a medical center. results: all staphylococcus aureus isolates were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin (< or = 2 micrograms/ml). the mic90s were 1 mg/ml for both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s aureus. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited streptococci at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml or less. the mic90s were 1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, s pyogenes and viridans streptococci. ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml, with an mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. h influenzae was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml, with an mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. b catarrhalis was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml, with an mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. conclusions: we found that quinupristin/dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against staphylococci, streptococci and b catarrhalis but less in vitro activity against h influenzae.
[nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for s. aureus and cns.
comparative in vitro activity of clarithromycin. spanish collaborative group.
the activity in vitro of clarithromycin, a new macrolide, was compared to that of various antibiotics in tests using 3,880 clinical isolates. clarithromycin was two times more active than erythromycin against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococci of groups c, g and f, brucella melitensis, legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma spp., 16 times more active against ureaplasma urealyticum and 2 to 4 times less active against campylobacter spp. in general, clarithromycin showed intrinsic activity 2 to 4 times higher than that of roxithromycin and 4 to 8 times higher than that of miocamycin. cross-resistance was found between the macrolides. clarithromycin was bactericidal against streptococcus spp. and haemophilus influenzae.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
comparative in vitro activity of win 57273, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent.
the in vitro activity of win 57273, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent, was evaluated against approximately 600 bacterial isolates. the new drug was 4- to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against a broad range of gram-positive organisms, with the new drug inhibiting 90% of strains of each species except enterococcus faecium at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. win 57273 was four- to eightfold less active than ciprofloxacin against many members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but the mics of the new drug for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) were less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml (range, 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml) for all species. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and legionella spp. were highly susceptible (mic90s, less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml). win 57273 demonstrated excellent activity against anaerobes (mic90s, less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml), and the drug was also more active than ciprofloxacin against 30 strains of mycobacterium avium-m. intracellulare (mic, 0.1 to 1.0 microgram/ml). the activity of win 57273 against gram-positive organisms was minimally affected by ph and increased at low ph (5.4) against gram-negative organisms. the bactericidal activity of win 57273 was demonstrated by time-kill techniques against selected organisms. the frequencies of spontaneous resistance to the new agent were low, but resistant colonies could be selected after serial passage of initially susceptible organisms through incremental concentrations of the drug.
comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
we have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. in-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. although pristinamycin's mean mic for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (mic greater than or equal to 3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin showed poor activity against haemophilus influenzae (mode mic 1.56 and mic90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin inhibited all nine clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. it was less effective against the bacteroides fragilis group: (mic90 3.12 mg/l). pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.
