TI  == emergence of coryneform bacteria as pathogens in nosocomial surgical site infections in a tertiary care hospital of north india.
AB  == purpose: a prospective study was conducted to assess the role of coryneform bacteria in surgical site infections among obstetric and gynecological patients undergoing surgery. materials and methods: the surgery was graded according to the degree of contamination, and surgical site infections (ssis) were classified  as superficial or deep. pus samples were collected from ssis according to rigorous aseptic precautions, and the quality of specimens was assessed by q-score. a detailed clinical and treatment history was elicited from all patients. the samples were processed using standard protocols. coryneform bacteria were considered significant pathogens only if they fulfilled rigorous clinical and microbiological criteria. antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the kirby-bauer method according to the clsi guidelines. results: in total, 127 patients developed ssis among 882 postoperative patients. of these, 89 (70.1%) were culture positive: 40 (44.9%) were gram-positive cocci, 27 (30.3%) were coryneform, and 22 (24.7%) were gram-negative bacilli. all coryneform-infected patients had fever and post-operative wound dehiscence leading to a prolonged hospital stay. the most commonly isolated organism was staphylococcus aureus (33.7%), followed by corynebacterium amycolatum (11.2%), escherichia coli (8.9%), citrobacter spp. (7.8%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (6.7%). in our study, 45.5% were esbl producers, 18.2% were amp c producers, and 40% were mrsa. all the coryneform bacteria were multidrug resistant, and 51.8% of isolates were sensitive to only gatifloxacin and vancomycin. symptomatic improvement was observed in all coryneform-infected patients after the administration of appropriate therapy. conclusion: coryneform  bacteria appear to be emerging as significant nosocomial surgical site pathogens. the high level of multidrug resistance observed in coryneform bacteria in our study is cause for alarm.

TI  == [etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia at the cardiovascular surgery clinic of iasi].
AB  == aim: we want to assess the etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and  emergence of resistant phenotypes for greater efficiency of the first-line antimicrobial treatment post-cardiac surgery. the study focuses on patients with  vap post-cardiac surgery at the institute of cardiovascular surgery between april 2nd 2002 and august 27th 2008, divided in two groups, before and after june 14th, 2005. material and methods: the tracheal aspirates were examined quantitatively (microscopy, culture). the isolates with clinical significance (> or = 106 cfu/ml) were identified by standard methods and tested by disk difussion or with  the breakpoints method for susceptibility to antibiotics. results: among the 1527 operated patients, 28 of them were diagnosed with vap through the clinical pulmonary infection score > or = 6. the 9 most common pathogens in vap etiology were pseudomonas aeruginosa 23.81%, acinetobacter baumannii 19.05%, stenotrophomonas maltophilia 11.91%, candida albicans 9.53%, while klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium striatum/amycolatum, pneumocystis jirovecii amounted 4.76% each. acinetobacter baumannii and s.maltophilia appear starting with june 15th, 2005. from that moment on we isolated with a higher frequency the gram-negative bacilli which produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases 15.62%, with multidrug resistance (mdr) 46.86%. the mdr phenotype was more frequent at a.baumannii (15.62%), s. maltophilia (15.62%) and p. aeruginosa (12.50%) compared to k .pneumoniae (3.12%) or e. coli (0%). methicillin-resistant s. aureus was isolated with a 6.25% frequency. conclusions: the most common etiologic agents of ventilator-associated pneumonia post-cardiac surgery are pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and candida albicans. the large use of antibiotics selects infectious agents with intrinsic resistance and multiresistant
