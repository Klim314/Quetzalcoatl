TI  == microbiological and chemical characteristics of taruba, an indigenous beverage produced from solid cassava fermentation.
AB  == the aim of this work was to identify and characterize the microbiota present during fermentation and in the final beverage, taruba, by culture-dependent and -independent methods. in addition, target chemical compounds (carbohydrates, organic acids, and ethanol) were evaluated. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and mesophilic bacteria were the predominant microorganisms. among them, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus subtilis were frequently isolated and detected by dgge analysis. torulaspora delbrueckii was the dominant yeast species. yeast isolates pichia exigua, candida rugosa, t. delbrueckii, candida tropicalis, pichia kudriavzevii,  wickerhamomyces anomalus, and candida ethanolica and bacteria isolates lb. plantarum, bacillus subtilis, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus sp., and chitinophaga terrae showed amylolytic activity. only isolates of p. exigua and t. delbrueckii and all species of the genus bacillus identified  in this work exhibited proteolytic activity. all microbial isolates grew at 38 degrees c, and only the isolates belonging to hanseniaspora uvarum species did not grow at 42 degrees c. these characteristics are important for further development of starter cultures; isolates of t. delbrueckii, p. exigua, and bacillus species identified in this work displayed all of these properties and are potential strains for use as starter culture in cassava fermented food.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from water-buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == this study evaluated the probiotic properties (stability at different ph values and bile salt concentration, auto-aggregation and co-aggregation, survival in the presence of antibiotics and commercial drugs, study of beta-galactosidase production, evaluation of the presence of genes encoding mapa and mub adhesion proteins and ef-tu elongation factor, and the presence of genes encoding virulence factor) of four lab strains (lactobacillus casei sjrp35, leuconostoc citreum sjrp44, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus sjrp57 and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides sjrp58) which produced antimicrobial substances (antimicrobial peptides). the strains survived the simulated git modeled in mrs broth, whole and skim milk. in addition, auto-aggregation and the cell surface hydrophobicity of all strains were high, and various degrees of co-aggregation were observed with indicator strains. all strains presented low resistance to several antibiotics and survived in the presence of commercial drugs. only the strain sjrp44 did not produce the beta-galactosidase enzyme. moreover, the strain sjrp57 did not show the presence  of any genes encoding virulence factors; however, the strain sjrp35 presented vancomycin resistance and adhesion of collagen genes, the strain sjrp44 harbored  the ornithine decarboxylase gene and the strain sjrp58 generated positive results for aggregation substance and histidine decarboxylase genes. in conclusion, the strain sjrp57 was considered the best candidate as probiotic cultures for further in vivo studies and functional food products development.

TI  == diversity of the lactic acid bacterium and yeast microbiota in the switch from firm- to liquid-sourdough fermentation.
AB  == four traditional type i sourdoughs were comparatively propagated (28 days) under  firm (dough yield, 160) and liquid (dough yield, 280) conditions to mimic the alternative technology options frequently used for making baked goods. after 28 days of propagation, liquid sourdoughs had the lowest ph and total titratable acidity (tta), the lowest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids and free amino acids, and the most stable density of presumptive lactic acid bacteria. the cell density of yeasts was the highest in liquid sourdoughs. liquid sourdoughs showed simplified microbial diversity and harbored a low number of strains, which were persistent. lactobacillus plantarum dominated firm sourdoughs over time. leuconostoc lactis and lactobacillus brevis dominated only some firm sourdoughs,  and lactobacillus sanfranciscensis persisted for some time only in some firm sourdoughs. leuconostoc citreum persisted in all firm and liquid sourdoughs, and  it was the only species detected in liquid sourdoughs at all times; it was flanked by leuconostoc mesenteroides in some sourdoughs. saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida humilis, saccharomyces servazzii, saccharomyces bayanus-kazachstania sp., and torulaspora delbrueckii were variously identified in firm and liquid sourdoughs. a total of 197 volatile components were identified through purge and trap-/solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pt-/spme-gc-ms). aldehydes, several alcohols, and some esters were  at the highest levels in liquid sourdoughs. firm sourdoughs mainly contained ethyl acetate, acetic acid, some sulfur compounds, and terpenes. the use of liquid fermentation would change the main microbial and biochemical features of traditional baked goods, which have been manufactured under firm conditions for a long time.

TI  == in vivo application and dynamics of lactic acid bacteria for the four-season production of vastedda-like cheese.
AB  == twelve lactic acid bacteria (lab), previously selected in vitro (gaglio et al., 2014), were evaluated in situ for their potential to act as starter cultures for  the continuous four-season production of vastedda-like cheese, made with raw ewes' milk. the strains belonged to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and streptococcus thermophilus. lab were first inoculated in multiple-strain combinations on the basis of their optimal growth temperatures in three process conditions which differed for milk treatment and medium for strain development: process 1, growth  of strains in the optimal synthetic media and pasteurised milk; process 2, growth of strains in whey based medium (wbm) and pasteurised milk; and process 3, growth of strains in wbm and raw milk. the strains that acidified the curds in short time, as shown by a ph drop, were all mesophilic and were then tested in a single inoculum through process 3. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis applied to the colonies isolated from the highest dilutions of samples confirmed the dominance of the added strains after curd acidification, stretching and storage. after 15days of refrigerated storage, the decrease in ph values showed an activity of the mesophilic strains at low temperatures, but only lc. lactis subsp. cremoris pon153, ln. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides pon259 and  pon559 increased their number during the 15days at 7 degrees c. a sensory evaluation indicated that the cheeses obtained by applying protocol 3 and by inoculation with lactococci are the most similar to the protected denomination of origin (pdo) cheese and received the best scores by the judges. thus, the experimental cheeses obtained with raw milk and inoculated with single and multiple combinations of lactococci were subjected to the analysis of the volatile organic compounds (vocs) carried out by a headspace solid phase microextraction (spme) technique coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (gc/ms). the dominance of lactococci over thermophilic lab of raw milk was verified during summer production and, based on the combination of voc profiles and sensory evaluation of the final cheeses, the multi-strain lactococcus culture resulted in the most suitable starter preparation for the full-year production of vastedda-like cheese.

TI  == microbial biodiversity in cheese consortia and comparative listeria growth on surfaces of uncooked pressed cheeses.
AB  == the study set out to determine how changes in the microbial diversity of a complex antilisterial consortium from the surface of st-nectaire cheese modify its antilisterial activities. on the basis of the microbial composition of a natural complex consortium named tr15 (truefood consortium 15), three new consortia of different species and strain compositions were defined: tr15-sc (58  isolates from tr15 collection), tr15-m (pools of isolates from selective counting media) and tr15-bhi (pools of isolates from bhi medium). their antilisterial activities on the surfaces of uncooked pressed cheese made with pasteurised milk  were compared with the activity of complex consortium tr15 and a control cheese inoculated only with starter culture (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii). the natural consortium tr15 was the most inhibitory, followed by reconstituted consortium tr15-bhi. the dynamics of the cheese rind microbial flora were monitored by counting on media and by isolate identification using 16s rdna sequencing and direct 16s rdna single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. the combination of these methods showed that rind with natural consortium tr15 had greater microbial diversity and different microbial dynamics  than cheese rinds with reconstituted consortia. cheese rind with the natural consortium showed higher citrate consumption and the highest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids, connected with high levels of lactic acid bacteria such  as carnobacterium maltaromaticum, vagococcus fluvialis, enterococcus gilvus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, brochothrix thermosphacta and lactococcus lactis, ripening bacteria such as arthrobacter nicotianae/arilaitensis, and gram negative bacteria (pseudomonas psychrophila and enterobacter spp.). the highest l. monocytogenes count was on rind with tr15-m and was positively associated with the highest ph value, high succinic and citric acid contents, and the highest levels of marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans and gram positive catalase positive bacteria represented by staphylococcus vitulinus, brevibacterium linens, microbacterium gubbeenense and brachybacterium tyrofermentans. the results show that the species composition of consortium is more important than the number of species. it is likely that inhibition mechanisms differ from one consortium to another; investigating gene expression will be an effective way to elucidate microbial interactions in cheese.

TI  == the influences of fish infusion broth on the biogenic amines formation by lactic  acid bacteria.
AB  == the influences of fish infusion decarboxylase broth (idb) on biogenic amines (ba) formation by lactic acid bacteria (lab) were investigated. ba productions by single lab strains were tested in five different fish (anchovy, mackerel, white shark, sardine and gilthead seabream) idb. the result of the study showed that significant differences in ammonia (amn) and ba production were observed among the lab strains in fish idb (p < 0.05). the highest amn and tma production by lab strains were observed for white shark idb. the all tested bacteria had decarboxylation activity in fish idb. the uppermost accumulated amines by lab strains were tyramine (tym), dopamine, serotonin and spermidine. the maximum histamine production was observed in sardine (101.69 mg/l) and mackerel (100.84 mg/l) idb by leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris and pediococcus acidophilus, respectively. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and pediococcus acidophilus had a high tym producing capability (2943 mg/l and 1157 mg/l) in sardine idb.

TI  == evaluation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast diversity in traditional white pickled and fresh soft cheeses from the mountain regions of serbia and lowland regions of croatia.
AB  == the goal of this study was the characterisation of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts isolated from nine white pickled (bg) and nine fresh soft (zg) artisanal cheeses collected in serbia and croatia. while lab were present in all of the cheeses collected, yeasts were found in all bg cheeses but  only in three zg cheese samples. high lab and yeast species diversity was determined (average h'(l)=0.4 and h'(y)=0.8, respectively). the predominant lab species in white pickled (bg) cheeses were lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, while in fresh soft (zg) cheeses the most dominant lab species were l. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and leuconostoc  pseudomesenteroides. among the 20 yeast species found, debaryomyces hansenii, candida zeylanoides, and torulaspora delbrueckii were found to be predominant in  bg cheeses, while yarrowia lipolytica was predominant in zg cheeses. the characterisation of metabolic and technological potentials revealed that 53.4% of lab isolates produced antimicrobial compounds, 44.3% of lab strains showed proteolytic activity, while most of the yeast species possessed either lipolytic  or proteolytic activity. in conclusion, the results obtained in this study showed that the composition of lab and yeast populations in white pickled and fresh soft cheeses is region specific. the knowledge gained in this study could eventually be used to select region specific lab and yeast strains for the production of white pickled and fresh soft artisanal cheeses with geographically specific origins under controlled conditions.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == identification of the agent from lactobacillus plantarum kfri464 that enhances bacteriocin production by leuconostoc citreum gj7.
AB  == aim: to provide evidence that the production of bacteriocin by lactic acid bacteria can be enhanced by the presence of a bacteriocin-sensitive strain and identify the agent that is responsible for enhancing bacteriocin production. methods and results: one bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacterium was isolated from kimchi. the strain gj7 was designated as leuconostoc citreum gj7 based on gram staining, biochemical properties, and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the isolate  produced a heat- and ph-stable bacteriocin (kimchicin gj7), which has antagonistic activity against a broad spectrum of micro-organisms. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified kimchicin gj7 showed a single band of molecular weight c. 3500 da. cultures of leuc. citreum gj7 in the presence of thermally inactivated kimchicin gj7-sensitive strains, lactobacillus plantarum kfri 464, lactobacillus delbrueckii kfri 347, or leuconostoc mesenteroides kctc 1628, increased bacteriocin production. this inducing factor was characterized and purified from lact. plantarum kfri 464, which showed the greatest enhancement of kimchicin gj7 activity. the inducing factor was purified using a deae (diethyl aminoethyl)-sephacel column and high-performance liquid chromatography, and yielded a single band of c. 6500 da.  n-terminal sequencing of the inducing factor identified 16 amino acids. the n-terminal sequence of the inducing factor was synthesized and examined for the induction of kimchicin gj7 activity, and was found to induce activity, but at a level about 10% lower than that of the entire molecule. conclusions: the presence of a bacteriocin-sensitive strain, lact. plantarum kfri 464, acts as an environmental stimulus to activate the production of kimchicin gj7 by leuc. citreum gj7. the inducing factor from lact. plantarum kfri 464 is highly homologous to the 30s ribosomal protein s16 from various micro-organisms. the n-terminal sequence of the inducing factor examined in this study is a very important sequence related to the inducing activity. nevertheless, the inducing factor may not be part of the ribosomal protein s16 itself. significance and impact of the study: we believe that the present study is the first to identify an agent that is produced by one micro-organism and influences bacteriocin production in another. the bacteriocin-enhancing system described in this study could be effectively used to control the growth of other micro-organisms (sensitive cells) in food systems. moreover, this enhancement of bacteriocin production can be applied usefully in industrial production of natural food preservatives.

TI  == characterisation of the microflora of attieke, a fermented cassava product, during traditional small-scale preparation.
AB  == attieke is a fermented cassava product consumed mainly in cote d'ivoire. the aim  of this study was to characterise the attieke fermentation by examining products  from 15 small-scale production sites at various stages of its preparation. for the preparation of attieke, fresh cassava is grated to a pulp and inoculated with 10% of a spontaneous traditional inoculum. the inocula contained aerobic mesophiles at mean numbers of 8.2 x 10(7) cfu/g and lactic and acetic acids at mean concentrations of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. the mean ph was 5.0. lactic acid bacteria were the dominant microorganisms in cassava pulp throughout fermentation with the mean numbers being 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/g after 15 h. the identification to the species level of microorganisms from one representative attieke production of good quality showed that, at the start of fermentation, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides was present in the highest numbers, accounting for 20% of all lactic acid bacteria. as the fermentation proceeded, this species was replaced by homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, present at 20% and 16%, respectively, and obligate heterofermentatives, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus confusus at 12% and 10%, respectively,  of total lactic acid bacteria in the flora at the end of fermentation. high numbers of acid-sensitive microorganisms, bacillus circulans, bacillus lentus, enterobacter sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, were transferred to the pulp in the inocula, but acidification to a mean ph of 4.4 with mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.59% and 0.2%, respectively, prevented their growth and reduced their numbers to less than 10(2) cfu/g at the end of fermentation. the mean numbers of candida tropicalis, the main yeast present, remained relatively constant at about 10(5) cfu/g throughout  attieke production. the mean numbers of aerobic mesophiles decreased to below 10(2) cfu/g as a result of the steaming process. the finished attieke had a mean  ph of 4.4 and mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == a new mobile genetic element in lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  == a new is element (isl3) was discovered in lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during the characterization of the linkage relationships between the two genes important for milk fermentation, beta-galactosidase (lacz) and the cell-wall associated protease (prtp). isl3 is a 1494 bp element, flanked by 38 bp imperfect inverted repeats, and generates an 8 bp target duplication upon insertion. it contains one open reading frame, encoding a potential polypeptide of 434 amino acids, which shows significant homology (34% identity) to the transposase of the leuconostoc mesenteroides element is1165. molecular analysis of spontaneous lacz mutants revealed some strains that had sustained deletions of 7 to 30 kb in size, centered on and eliminating the copy of isl3 next to lacz. other deletion endpoints were identified as located immediately adjacent to isl3. furthermore, genetic translocations that had occurred via transposition of isl3 were observed fortuitously in cultures screened for deletion mutants. isl3 can be found in one to several copies in various strains of l. delbrueckii. however, it  was not present in other dairy lactic acid bacteria tested.
