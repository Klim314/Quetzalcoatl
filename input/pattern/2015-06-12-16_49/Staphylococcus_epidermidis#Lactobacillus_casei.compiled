TI  - Lactic Acid Bacteria and Bifidobacteria-Inhibited Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria are able to produce antimicrobial compounds to inhibit opportunisticwounding skin pathogen. The antimicrobial compounds produced are organic acids, putative bacteriocin, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl. Staphylococcus epidermidis is well-known as an opportunistic wounding skin pathogen in wound infections related to implanted medical devices. OBJECTIVE: To screen 87 strains of LAB and 3 strains of bifidobacteria for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis.Additionally, this study sought to determine and quantify types of antimicrobial compounds produced by LAB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inhibitory activity of LAB and bifidobacteria on S. epidermidis was assessed with the spectrophotometric method using a 96-well microplate reader. Characterization of cell-free supernatant (CFS) was done using analytical methods. Lactobacillus fermentum (collected by the Bioprocess Department at the Universiti Sains Malaysia [BD]) 1912d, Lactobacillus casei BD 1415b, Lactobacillus fermentum BD 8313a, Pediococcus pentosaceus BD 1913b, and Weissella cibaria (collected by the Food Technology Department at the Universiti Sains Malaysia [FTDC]) 8643 with high percentage of inhibition (P < 0.05), ranging from 73.7% to 88.2%, as compared to the control, were selected for subsequent analyses. Upon neutralization, the antimicrobial activity showed a drastic drop (P < 0.05) in the percentage of inhibition. Concentrations of the inhibitive metabolites were produced in varying amounts and were strain dependent. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that lactic acid in all strains was produced in a more predominant amount than acetic acid. Protein concentration production ranged from 0.081-0.215 mg/mL. L. fermentum BD 1912d yielded as much as 0.014 mg/mL hydrogen peroxide, which was significantly higher than other strains studied. Diacetyl was produced in a higher concentration by Weissella cibaria FTDC 8643 at 2.884 ng/mL; the lowest concentration of 0.465 ng/mL was produced by Ped. pentosaceus BD 1913b. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial metabolites from CFS of lactic acid bacteria were effective in repressing the growth of opportunistic wounding dermal pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - A sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium Bacillus sp. YAS 1 strain.
AB  - Bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. The present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as Bacillus sp. YAS 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. A sequential statistical approach (Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (BAC YAS 1) production. Using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in BAC YAS 1 level (470 AU/mL arbitrary units against Erwinia amylovora). BAC YAS 1 showed activity over a wide range of pH (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees C). A wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of BAC YAS 1 against the human pathogens (Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus sp., Proteus sp., Klebsiella sp., and Salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (E. amylovora), and the food spoiler (Listeria innocua) was demonstrated. On top and above, BAC YAS 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. lactis, and L. reuteri). Promising characteristics of BAC YAS 1 prompt its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.
TI  - Characterization of novel glycolipid antigens with an alpha-galactose epitope in  lactobacilli detected with rabbit anti-Lactobacillus antisera and occurrence of antibodies against them in human sera.
AB  - Anti-Lactobacillus johnsonii (LJ) antisera generated by immunization of rabbits with LJ reacted with glyceroglycolipids in LJ, i.e. dihexaosyl diacylglycerol (DH-DG), trihexaosyl DG (TH-DG) and tetrahexaosyl DG (TetH-DG), whose reactivities with antisera increased proportionally with longer carbohydrate chains of glycolipids. Structural analyses of glycolipids from LJ revealed that DH-DG was Galalpha1-2Glcalpha1-3'DG, and TH-DG and TetH-DG were novel derivatives of it with alpha-Gal at the non-reducing terminal, i.e. Galalpha1-6Galalpha1-2Glcalpha1-3'DG and Galalpha1-6Galalpha1-6Galalpha1-2Glcalpha1-3'DG, respectively. DH-DG was commonly present in several lactobacilli examined, but TetH-DG was restricted to LJ, L. intestinalis and L. reuteri, while the TH-DGs from L. casei were Glc1-6Galalpha1-2Glcalpha1-3'DG and an esterified derivative of it, Glc1-6Galalpha1-2Glc(6-fatty acid)alpha1-3'DG, as reported in the literature. Anti-LJ antisera reacted with TH-DG and esterified TH-DG from L. casei to lesser extents, but not at all with gentibiosyl DG from Staphylococcus epidermidis or kojibiosyl DG from Streptococcus salivalis or sphingoglycolipids containing alpha-Gal residues. The major molecular species of glycolipids obtained from lactobacilli were 11-octadecenoic and 11,12-methylene-octadecanoic acids-containing ones. Also, human IgM antibodies against TH-DG and TetH-DG from LJ were detected in human sera, with various antibody titres, indicating that an immune reaction to symbiotic lactobacilli occurs against their glycolipid antigens, TH-DG and TetH-DG.
TI  - Typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR to assess genetic diversity.
AB  - The recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. The current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified DNA, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. We have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. Initially, purified DNA and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. The conditions that were found to be optimal 8 muM of 10-mer primers, 3 muM magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The RAPD genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) PFU mL(-1) were highly reproducible. Clustering by the Pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar DNA restriction pattern were indistinguishable. The results support the use of RAPD-PCR for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of their genetic diversity bypassing tedious DNA purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of culture fluid components of Lactobacillus fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3, and their capacity to modulate adhesion of Candida albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - Antagonistic activities of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21), L. casei ATCC 27216, and L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 and bactericidal activity of lactobacillus culture fluid towards E. coli strain K12, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis test cultures were studied. The bactericidal effect of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation (pH 6.0) on the test cultures was dose-dependent. Adhesion of C. albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epitheliocytes was more pronounced for strains isolated from women with asymptomatic infection than for strains isolated from women with manifest forms. L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation modulated adhesion of yeast-like fungi only if the fungal strain was initially highly adherent.
TI  - Stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  - The microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of breeding conditions on their composition. The diversity of microbial communities was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16S and 18S rDNA sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16S rDNA from clone libraries (six milks). The stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of variable region V3 of the 16S rRNA gene and variable region V4 of the 18S rRNA gene. One hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. Wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. In addition to species commonly encountered in milk, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus caprae, Staphylococcus equorum, Micrococcus sp., Kocuria sp., Pantoea agglomerans and Pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as Corynebacterium variabile, Arthrobacter sp., Brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, Clostridium sp. and Rothia sp. Several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, Salinicoccus sp., Dietza maris, Exiguobacterium, Ornithinicoccus sp. and Hahella chejuensis. The yeast community was composed of Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Trichosporon beigelii, Rhodotorula glutinis, Rhodotorula minuta, Candida pararugosa, Candida intermedia, Candida inconspicua, Cryptococcus curvatus and Cryptococcus magnus. The analyses of microbial counts and microbial SSCP profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding regime. The microbial community was stable within each period. Milks from winter were characterized by Lactococcus and Pseudomonas, those from summer by P. agglomerans and Klebsiella and those from autumn by Chryseobacterium indologenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria and yeasts. However, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. This study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.
TI  - Antibacterial agent discovery using thymidylate synthase biolibrary screening.
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS, ThyA) catalyzes the reductive methylation of 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate to 2'-deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate, an essential precursor for DNA synthesis. A specific inhibition of this enzyme induces bacterial cell death. As a second round lead optimization design, new 1,2-naphthalein derivatives have been synthesized and tested against a TS-based biolibrary, including human thymidylate synthase (hTS). Docking studies have been performed to rationalize the experimentally observed affinity profiles of 1,2-naphthalein compounds toward Lactobacillus casei TS and hTS. The best TS inhibitors have been tested against a number of clinical isolates of Gram-positive-resistant bacterial strains. Compound 3,3-bis(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1H,3H-naphtho[1,2-c]furan-1-one (5) showed significant antibacterial activity, no in vitro toxicity, and dose-response effects against Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC=0.5-2.5 microg/mL) clinical isolate strains, which are resistant to at least 17 of the best known antibacterial agents, including vancomycin. So far this compound can be regarded as a leading antibacterial agent.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - Verbalactone, a new macrocyclic dimer lactone from the roots of Verbascum undulatum with antibacterial activity.
AB  - A novel macrocyclic dimer lactone, named verbalactone, was isolated from the roots of Verbascum undulatum and exhibited interesting antibacterial activity. It is the first time that 1,7-dioxacyclododecane is reported as the ring system of a natural product. The structure and the absolute stereochemistry of the new compound were determined by spectral methods and chemical correlation.
TI  - Effects of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin on physicochemical surface properties of  Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Under clinical conditions, during antibiotic treatment, micro-organisms often grow at sub-inhibitory concentrations. This may lead to altered adhesive cell surface properties and to a disruption of the indigenous microflora, in addition to the creation of a more pathogenic biofilm. The effects of growing Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and lactobacilli in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin were determined. Growing the cells under antibiotic burden sometimes led to altered cell surface hydrophobicity (by adhesion to hexadecane), changes in the pH-dependence of zeta potentials, and elemental surface compositions or in different SDS-PAGE protein profiles. For several isolates only one of the surface properties was altered by the presence of an antibiotic in the growth medium and no systematic effects were observed for all isolates representing a certain species or even strain. The important conclusion to be drawn from the results of this study is that the effects of growing cells under antibiotic burden on their adhesive cell surface properties can only be established when using a variety of techniques.
TI  - The microbial ecology of soybean soaking for tempe production.
AB  - Soybeans soaked in tap water for 24 to 36 h at 20, 30 or 37 degrees C underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/ml (depending on temperature) and a reduction of pH from 6.5 to 4.5. Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae dominated the fermentation but, significant contributions were also made by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter diversus and Bacillus brevis, and the yeasts Pichia burtonii, Candida didensiae and Rhodotorula rubra. Fermentation of surface-decontaminated beans in sterile water with pure cultures of these isolates showed L. casei, Strep. faecium and Staph. epidermidis to be the main species responsible for the pH reduction. Soybeans were the main source of microorganisms for the fermentation. Boiled beans did not undergo an acid fermentation.
TI  - Arginolytic and ureolytic activities of pure cultures of human oral bacteria and  their effects on the pH response of salivary sediment and dental plaque in vitro.
AB  - Thirty-nine different microorganisms commonly found in supragingival plaque and salivary sediment were screened for their ability to raise the pH by producing base from arginine, lysylarginine and urea. Only Actinomyces naeslundii and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant pH-rise activity with all three compounds. Eleven bacteria demonstrated such activity with arginine and lysylarginine but not with urea. Only one, Actinomyces viscosus, produced a pH-rise with urea but not with the two arginine compounds. The remaining 26 bacteria showed little or no base-forming activity with any of the three test substrates. The ability of the different oral bacteria to produce base (especially from urea) was a less universal function than their ability to produce acid from fermentable carbohydrate. Substituting pure cultures of arginolytic or non-arginolytic bacteria for portions of the mixed bacterial populations of plaque or sediment in test incubations containing glucose and arginine altered their ability to produce pH-fall-pH-rise responses shaped like those of the Stephen curve in vivo. In general, addition of arginolytic bacteria made these in vitro pH responses less acidic, whereas addition of non-arginolytic bacteria made the responses more acidic. Because of the relatively high arginolytic activity of the plaque harvested in this study, the effect of adding non-arginolytic bacteria was more readily seen than the converse. Similar changes in levels of ureolytic microorganisms and incubation with glucose and urea had little effect on sediment or plaque being able to produce a pH-fall-pH-rise type of response. When increasing proportions of the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment were replaced with the highly cariogenic Lactobacillus casei or Streptococcus mutans, the pH minimum became slightly more acidic and then slightly more alkaline, whereas the pH-rise became progressively and significantly less. Thus arginolytic bacteria have a different and greater effect on shaping the pH response of plaque or sediment than ureolytic bacteria. A large change in the proportions of arginolytic or non-arginolytic microorganisms may be needed to make a plaque microflora potentially non-cariogenic or cariogenic, respectively.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
