interactive effects of ph and temperature on the bacteriocin stability by response surface analysis.
the combined influence of ph and temperature on bacteriocins produced by three lactic acid bacteria, pediococcus pentosaceus mmz26, enterococcus faecium mmz17 and lactococcus lactis mmz25, isolated from tunisian traditional dry fermented meat was studied using a second order orthogonal factorial design and response-surface methodology (rsm). this method allows estimating the interactive effects of ph and temperature on the stability of each bacteriocin. the high heat stability of the three bacteriocins was demonstrated, with optimum values at light acidic ph around 5.0, temperature below 90 degrees c and short incubation times. this study contributes to a better understanding of relation between bacteriocins production and stability in order to enhance their, in situ, application as a food and feed biopreservative in fermented and/or heated food products.
susceptibility of pediococcus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
aim: to investigate the susceptibility of pediococcus species to antimicrobial agents. methods and results: the susceptibility to 14 antimicrobial agents of 31 genotypically distinct strains of six pediococcus species was assessed by using etests on iso-sensitest agar supplemented with horse blood. the species included were pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus damnosus, pediococcus dextrinicus, pediococcus inopinatus, pediococcus parvulus and pediococcus pentosaceus. for several antimicrobial agents, some species were more susceptible than others. the two industrially important species, p. acidilactici and p. pentosaceus, differed with respect to erythromycin and trovafloxacin susceptibility, and in general both species had higher minimum inhibitory concentrations than the other species. in an erythromycin-resistant p. acidilactici, an erythromycin resistance methylase b [erm(b)] gene was identified by pcr. using a plasmid preparation from strain p. acidilactici 6990, a previously erythromycin-sensitive lactococcus lactis strain was made resistant. transformants harboured a single plasmid, sized at 11.6 kb through sequence analysis. in addition, the erm(b) gene was identified within the plasmid sequence. conclusions: the phenotypic test indicated the absence of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in 30 of the strains. significance and impact of the study: these results will help in selection of the best pediococcus strains for use as starter cultures.
purification and genetic characterization of plantaricin nc8, a novel coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin from lactobacillus plantarum nc8.
a new, coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin named plantaricin nc8 (plnc8)  was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum nc8 cultures which had been induced with lactococcus lactis mg1363 or pediococcus pentosaceus fbb63. this bacteriocin consists of two distinct peptides, named alpha and beta, which were separated by c(2)-c(18) reverse-phase chromatography and whose complementary action is necessary for full plantaricin nc8 activity. n-terminal sequencing of both purified peptides showed 28 and 34 amino acids residues for plnc8 alpha and plnc8 beta, respectively, which showed no sequence similarity to other known bacteriocins. mass spectrometry analysis showed molecular masses of 3,587 da (alpha) and 4,000 da (beta). the corresponding genes, designated plnc8a and plnc8b, were sequenced, and their nucleotide sequences revealed that both peptides are produced as bacteriocin precursors of 47 and 55 amino acids, respectively, which include n-terminal leader sequences of the double-glycine type. the mature alpha and beta peptides contain 29 and 34 amino acids, respectively. an open reading frame, orfc, which encodes a putative immunity protein was found downstream of plnc8b and overlapping plnc8a. upstream of the putative -35 region of plnc8b, two direct repeats of 9 bp were identified, which agrees with the consensus sequence and structure of promoters of class ii bacteriocin operons whose expression is dependent on an autoinduction mechanism.
monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassay for pediocins of pediococcus acidilactici.
monoclonal antibody (mab) r2-ar against pediocin rs2 was developed. mice were immunized for 12 weeks with pediocin rs2 conjugated to a polyacrylamide gel. two hybridoma fusions yielded an mab that in western blots (immunoblots) reacted only with pediocins rs2 and ach (3 kda) from pediococcus acidilactici rs2 and h, respectively, and did not react with any other bacteriocin, including sakacin a from lactobacillus sake lb 706, leuconocin lcm1 from leuconostoc carnosum lm1, nisin from lactococcus lactis atcc 11454, and pediocin a from pediococcus pentosaceus fbb61. each of the bacteriocin bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels was confirmed to be biologically active by a gel overlay test performed with sensitive indicator organisms. in dot immunoblot assays, the mab could detect a minimum of 32,000 arbitrary units of pediocin rs2 or ach per ml. in colony immunoblot assays, the mab was used successfully to differentiate bac+ and bac- variants of p. acidilactici rs2 strains.
bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of clostridium botulinum spores by lactic acid bacteria at refrigeration and abuse temperatures.
the bacteriocinogenicity of lactococcus lactis atcc 11454, pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 43200, p. pentosaceus atcc 43201, lactobacillus plantarum bn, l. plantarum lb592, l. plantarum lb75, and lactobacillus acidophilus n2 against clostridium botulinum spores at 4, 10, 15, and 35 degrees c was investigated by modified deferred and simultaneous antagonism methods. all the strains, except l. acidophilus n2, produced inhibition zones on lawns of c. botulinum spores at 30 degrees c. l. plantarum bn, l. lactis atcc 11454, and p. pentosaceus atcc 43200 and 43201 were bacteriocinogenic at 4, 10, and 15 degrees c. supplementation of brain heart infusion agar with 0 to 5% nacl increased the radii of inhibition zones during simultaneous antagonism assays. detectable bacteriocin activities were extracted from freeze-thawed agar cultures of l. plantarum bn and l. lactis atcc 11454 which had been grown at 4 and 10 degrees c. these results suggest that low levels of l. plantarum bn or l. lactis atcc 11454, in the presence of 3 or 4% nacl, could be formulated into minimally processed refrigerated food products for protection against possible botulism hazards.
