TI  == microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  == nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. all the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (control). all the interventions had a duration of 30 days. the dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. the supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). the total genome counts  from the control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). after 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis. other major periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels.  the toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts  in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.
