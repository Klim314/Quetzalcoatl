TI == acute-phase responses in cattle infected with hydatid cysts and microbial agents.
AB == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hydatid cysts and microbial agents on the acute-phase response in cattle. twenty-seven cattle with hydatid cysts and eight apparently healthy cattle comprised the study and control groups, respectively. parasitological, microbiological, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the liver and lungs were undertaken, and 49 of these organs were infected with cysts. in 14 of 31 (45.1%) livers and 10 of 18 (55.5%) lungs microbial growth was observed. the most frequent species occurring in the liver were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter spp., whereas in the lungs the most common species was candida spp., followed by streptococcus spp., mannheimia haemolytica, corynebacterium spp., micrococcus spp. and s. aureus. the concentration of serum interleukin (il-6) in infected cattle, 455.35 +/- 39.68 pg/ml, was significantly higher than that of 83.02 +/- 17.87 pg/ml in the control group (p0.05). the highest concentrations of il-6 were detected in serum of the cattle where microbial growth had been detected, followed by cattle infected with bacteria + trichostrongylus sp. (p< 0.001). consequently, saa showed an important increase in the group infected with hydatid cysts, whereas haptoglobin level decreased. it was noticed that il-6, like saa, had a significant role in hydatid cyst infection. therefore il-6 and saa appear to be major markers in the detection of infection of cattle with hydatid cysts.

TI == growth of mannheimia haemolytica: inhibitory agents and putative mechanism of inhibition.
AB == leukotoxin-producing mannheimia haemolytica consistently causes fatal pneumonia in bighorn sheep (bhs) under experimental conditions. surprisingly, by culture methods, it has been isolated from pneumonic bhs lungs less frequently than other bacteria. however, in one study pcr assays detected m. haemolytica from over 70% of the pneumonic lung samples that were negative for this organism by culture, suggesting that the growth of m. haemolytica is inhibited by other bacteria. previously, we have shown that bibersteinia trehalosi inhibits the growth of m. haemolytica. herein we report that 100% of a diverse panel of b. trehalosi isolates (n=55) tested in a bacterial competition assay inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica, suggesting that the inhibitory phenotype is conserved. further, no plasmids were isolated from any of the 30 b. trehalosi isolates tested, suggesting that the effectors are chromosomally encoded. an earlier study by us showed that pasteurella multocida also inhibits the growth of m. haemolytica. however, m. haemolytica has not been isolated even from pneumonic bhs lungs that did not carry b. trehalosi or p. multocida. consequently, we tested staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., and escherichia coli, the bacteria that have been detected frequently in pneumonic bhs lungs, for possible inhibition of m. haemolytica. neither the staphylococcus spp. nor the streptococcus sp. strains inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica. e. coli inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica by a proximity-dependent mechanism. growth inhibition of m. haemolytica by several bacterial species is likely to contribute to the infrequent detection of this bacterium from pneumonic bhs lungs by culture.

TI == antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring of respiratory tract pathogens isolated from diseased cattle and pigs across europe: the vetpath study.
AB == vetpath is an ongoing pan-european antibiotic susceptibility monitoring programme collecting pathogens from diseased antimicrobial non-treated cattle, pigs and poultry. in the current study, 1001 isolates from cattle and pig respiratory tract infections were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities. non-replicate lung samples or nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs were collected from animals with acute clinical signs in 11 countries during 2002-2006. pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica from cattle and p. multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and streptococcus suis from pigs were isolated by standard methods. s. suis was also isolated from meningitis cases. mics of 16 antibiotics were assessed centrally by broth microdilution following clsi recommendations. results were interpreted using clsi breakpoints where available. p. multocida (231) and m. haemolytica (138) isolates were all susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. resistance to florfenicol and spectinomycin was 0.4% and 3.5% in p. multocida, respectively, and absent in m. haemolytica isolates. tetracycline resistance was 5.7% and 14.6% for p. multocida and m. haemolytica. in pigs, 230 p. multocida, 220 a. pleuropneumoniae and 182 s. suis isolates were recovered. resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, tiamulin and tilmicosin was absent or <1%. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance was 3-6% and tetracycline resistance varied from 14.7% in a. pleuropneumoniae to 81.8% in s. suis. in conclusion, low resistance to antibiotics with defined clinical breakpoints, except for tetracycline, was observed among the major respiratory tract pathogens recovered from cattle and pigs. since for approximately half of the antibiotics in this panel no clsi-defined breakpoints were available, setting of the missing veterinary breakpoints is important.

TI == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI == diversity of bacterial species in the nasal cavity of sheep in the highlands of ethiopia and first report of histophilus somni in the country.
AB == a study was conducted to isolate bacterial species/pathogens from the nasal cavity of apparently healthy and pneumonic sheep. nasal swabs were collected aseptically, transported in tryptose soya broth and incubated for 24 h. then, each swab was streaked onto chocolate and blood agar for culture. bacterial species were identified following standard bacteriological procedures. accordingly, a total of 1,556 bacteria were isolated from 960 nasal swabs collected from three different highland areas of ethiopia, namely debre berhan, asella, and gimba. in debre berhan, 140 mannheimia haemolytica, 81 histophilus somni, 57 staphylococcus species, and 52 bibersteinia trehalosi were isolated. while from gimba m. haemolytica, staphylococcus, streptococcus, and h. somni were isolated at rates of 25.2, 15.9, 11.4, and 5.9 %, respectively, of the total 647 bacterial species. in asella from 352 bacterial species isolated, 93 (26.4 %) were m. haemolytica, 48 (13.6 %) were staphylococcus species, 26 (7.4 %) were b. trehalosi, and 17 (4.8 %) h. somni were recognized. further identification and characterization using biolog identification system enterococcus avium and sphingomonas sanguinis were identified at 100 % probability, while, h. somni and actinobacillus lignerisii were suggested by the system. the study showed that a variety of bacterial species colonize the nasal cavity of the ethiopian highland sheep with variable proportion between healthy and pneumonic ones. to our knowledge, this is the first report on isolation of h. somni, an important pathogen in cattle, from the respiratory tract of a ruminant species in the country.

TI == survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in europe.
AB == a monitoring programme conducted in europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (brd) cases between 2002 and 2008. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. for respiratory pathogens, pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (mic</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of m haemolytica strains were resistant (mic>/=4 microg/ml). histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). mycoplasma bovis mic (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. for mastitis pathogens, the majority of escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568 and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with mic centred on 0.25 microg/ml. streptococcus uberis and streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with mic centred on 1 microg/ml. marbofloxacin mic for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published mic results.

TI == risk factors and impacts of clinical and subclinical mastitis in commercial meat-producing sheep flocks in quebec, canada.
AB == we conducted a prospective observational study on clinical and subclinical mastitis in 30 commercial meat-producing sheep flocks from 2 regions of the province of quebec, canada. a total of 2,792 ewes selected in late gestation were followed from lambing to weaning of lambs. the incidence of clinical mastitis for the total lactation period (average of 58 days) ranged among flocks from 0 to 6.6%, with a median of 1.2%. the most frequently isolated bacteria from the cases of clinical mastitis, in pure or mixed culture, were mannheimia haemolytica (26%), staphylococcus aureus (23%), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (17%). incidence of clinical mastitis was higher in ewes that gave birth to 3 or more lambs and from the estrie region, and was associated with an increase in ewe mortality, an increase in lamb mortality at the litter level, and a decrease in lamb's weaning weight for lambs born in multiple litter size or from ewes >or=4 years old. among 354 selected ewes with clinically normal udder at the end of lactation, 28.8% had potentially pathogenic bacteria isolated from milk. the most prevalent bacteria were s. aureus (9.3%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (9.3%). the risk of having a positive culture in at least one half was different between the two regions. prevalence of ewes (n=261) with california mastitis test (cmt) positive result in at least one half was 24.1 and 14.9% using a cut-off of >or=1+ and >or=2+, respectively. prevalence of culture-positive udder halves was 11.7% for cmt-negative compared with 53.6% for cmt 3+ halves. cmt status was positively associated with the isolation of coagulase-negative staphylococci, m. haemolytica, s. aureus, and various streptococcus species, but not with other isolated bacteria. additionally, prevalence of cmt-positive halves was higher in ewes from the estrie region, aged of >or=4 years versus 1 year, having clinical mastitis previously detected in the lactation and/or with low body condition score. lamb weaning weight was associated with cmt status of ewes, while weaning weight was not associated with milk culture results. more research is needed to understand the dynamic of milk scc and imi in ewes from meat-producing flocks, its economical impact and best ways to control it.

TI == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle in different european countries: 2002-2004.
AB == background: the project "antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal origin - ii" (arbao-ii) was funded by the european union (fair5-qlk2-2002-01146) for the period 2003-2005, with the aim to establish a continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility among veterinary laboratories in european countries based on validated and harmonised methodologies. available summary data of the susceptibility testing of the bacterial pathogens from the different laboratories were collected. method: antimicrobial susceptibility data for several bovine pathogens were obtained over a three year period (2002-2004). each year the participating laboratories were requested to fill in excel-file templates with national summary data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance from different bacterial species.a proficiency test (eqas - external quality assurance system) for antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted each year to test the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the participating laboratories. the data from this testing demonstrated that for the species included in the eqas the results are comparable between countries. results: data from 25,241 isolates were collected from 13 european countries. for staphylococcus aureus from bovine mastitis major differences were apparent in the occurrence of resistance between countries and between the different antimicrobial agents tested. the highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin. for mannheimia haemolytica resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphonamide were observed in france, the netherlands and portugal. all isolates of pasteurella multocida isolated in finland and most of those from denmark, england (and wales), italy and sweden were susceptible to the majority of the antimicrobials. streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis isolates from sweden were fully susceptible. for the other countries some resistance was observed to tetracycline, gentamicin and erythromycin. more resistance and variation of the resistance levels between countries were observed for escherichia coli compared to the other bacterial species investigated. conclusion: in general, isolates from denmark, england (and wales), the netherlands, norway, sweden and switzerland showed low frequencies of resistance, whereas many isolates from belgium, france, italy, latvia and spain were resistant to most antimicrobials tested. in the future, data on the prevalence of resistance should be used to develop guidelines for appropriate antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine.

TI == clinical mastitis in ewes; bacteriology, epidemiology and clinical features.
AB == background: clinical mastitis is an important disease in sheep. the objective of  this work was to identify causal bacteria and study certain epidemiological and clinical features of clinical mastitis in ewes kept for meat and wool production. methods: the study included 509 ewes with clinical mastitis from 353 flocks located in 14 of the 19 counties in norway. clinical examination and collection of udder secretions were carried out by veterinarians. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) was performed on 92 staphylococcus aureus isolates from 64 ewes. results and conclusion: s. aureus was recovered from 65.3% of 547 clinically affected mammary glands, coagulase-negative staphylococci from 2.9%, enterobacteria, mainly escherichia coli, from 7.3%, streptococcus spp. from 4.6%, mannheimia haemolytica from 1.8% and various other bacteria from 4.9%, while no bacteria were cultured from 13.2% of the samples. forty percent of the ewes with unilateral clinical s. aureus mastitis also had a subclinical s. aureus infection in the other mammary gland. twenty-four of 28 (86%) pairs of s. aureus isolates obtained from clinically and subclinically affected mammary glands of the same ewe were indistinguishable by pfge. the number of identical pairs was significantly greater than expected, based on the distribution of different s. aureus types within the flocks. one-third of the cases occurred during the first week after lambing, while a second peak was observed in the third week of lactation. gangrene was present in 8.8% of the clinically affected glands; s. aureus was recovered from 72.9%, clostridium perfringens from 6.3% and e. coli from 6.3% of the secretions from such glands. this study shows that s. aureus predominates as a cause of clinical ovine mastitis in norway, also in very severe cases. results also indicate that s. aureus is frequently spread between udder halves of infected ewes.

TI == potential pathogens carried by spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern spain.
AB == the spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. we sampled 321 ibex (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with sarcoptes scabiei. a total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with s. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. infections with mycoplasma agalactiae and mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. with escherichia coli, mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida biotype a, and staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher isolation rates were associated with adults. the isolation frequency for e. coli was higher in females, whereas moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated with males. the presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and m. haemolytica. the geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of branhamella ovis, m. agalactiae, and all pasteurella sp. isolations of m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, e. coli, and b. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging rather than captive animals. of the gram-positive bacteria, s. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. mycoplasma agalactiae and m. arginini were the predominant mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. the most frequently isolated gram-negative bacteria included e. coli, m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, and b. ovis. isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. in nasal samples, m. haemolytica and p. multocida biotype a were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, b. ovis and e. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.

TI == results of the antimicrobial agent susceptibility study raised in a representative, cross-sectional monitoring study on a national basis.
AB == the use of antimicrobial substances in human and veterinary medicine inevitably results in a selection pressure for drug resistance in exposed bacteria. preventive measures, apt to avoid the consequent development of new resistances and selection for existing ones, respectively, have to be elaborated. moreover, it has to be ensured that neither resistant bacteria nor resistance genes are spread to and consequently via the food chain. respiratory diseases as well as mastitis in dairy cattle belong to the most frequently occurring diseases in food-producing animals. for the first time in germany, a comprehensive, cross-sectional study into the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria associated with these disease patterns in food-producing animals was conducted by the federal office of consumer protection and food safety (bvl) in 2001. the selection of examined bacterial species comprised pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica associated with respiratory disease in pigs, and escherichia coli, streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. causing mastitis in dairy cattle. bacterial strains were collected following a representative sampling scheme, taking into account the total number of animals in the individual german federal lander. in an analogous study conducted in 2002/2003, this selection was extended by the indication respiratory disease in juvenile cattle, caused by p. multocida and m. haemolytica, respectively. in comparison with data from 2001, mic values determined in 2002/2003 suggested significantly lower or higher degrees of drug susceptibility only for a few antimicrobial agents. comparison was carried out on the basis of bacterial species and individual federal lander, respectively. overall, the data raised in both studies revealed substantially lower resistance rates than published for germany so far. this is particularly true for results from those lander, whose animal health services had implemented preventive strategies to control infectious diseases. no correlation could be established between differing animal population densities and differences in the prevalence of resistance in corresponding lander. however, the geographical distribution of occurrence of resistance against beta-lactam antimicrobial agents suggests different therapeutic strategies employed in different sized animal flocks. in federal lander marked by large-scale livestock farming, significantly higher resistance values could be measured for cephalosporins than for penicillins, whereas in lander with rather traditional farming structures, resistance to penicillins was predominant. assuming otherwise similar factors of influence on the emergence of resistance, this pattern suggests that cephalosporins are preferably used in large enterprises and penicillins in smaller farms, respectively. currently, mechanisms effecting changes in antimicrobial resistance are being further investigated in a successive study.

TI == monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria from livestock animals.
AB == facing the problem of development and spreading of bacterial resistance, preventive strategies are considered the most appropriate means to counteract. the establishment of corresponding management options relies on scientifically defensible efforts to obtain objective data on the prevalence of bacterial resistance in healthy and diseased livestock. additionally, detailed statistics are needed on the overall amount of antimicrobial agents dispensed in germany. the collection of valid data on the prevalence of resistance requires representative and cross-sectional studies. the german national antimicrobial resistance monitoring of the federal office of consumer protection and food safety (bvl) determines the current quantitative resistance level of life-stock pathogens, in order to permit the evaluation and surveillance of the distribution of resistances on a valid basis. essential key features determining the design of these studies comprise (1) a statistically valid sampling program. this incorporates regional differences in animal population density, (2) the avoidance of "copy strains", (3) testing of no more than two bacterial strains belonging to one species per herd, (4) testing only if no antimicrobial therapy preceded sample collection, and (5) the use of standardized methods [e.g. microdilution broth method to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)]. the analysis and interpretation of this data permits reliable identification and definition of epidemiological characteristics of resistance and its development in animal associated bacteria, such as geographically and time wise differentiated profiles on its prevalence, the emergence of unknown phenotypes of resistance and an assessment of the threat resistant bacteria from animals pose for humans. in applied antimicrobial therapy, the data can serve as a decision guidance in choosing the antimicrobial agent most adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation. the susceptibility testing performed by the bvl suggests substantially lower degrees of resistance in bacteria isolated from cattle (mastitis: escherichia coli, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp.; respiratory disease: pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica) and pigs (respiratory disease: pasteurella multocida, bordetella bronchiseptica) in comparison to data published for germany so far. this includes results for substances that have given cause for frequent debate. only rare cases of resistance to enrofloxacin (fluoroquinolone) could be detected, and only 3% of bacterial strains tested proved resistant to 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, including substances prescribed in human medicine.

TI == clinical evaluation of postpartum vaginal mucus reflects uterine bacterial infection and the immune response in cattle.
AB == bacteria contaminate the uterus of most dairy cattle after parturition and endometritis causes infertility. an endometritis score can be ascribed based on the vaginal mucus character and odour but it is not clear if the clinical score reflects the number of uterine bacteria or the inflammatory response. the present study tested the hypothesis that clinical evaluation of endometritis reflects the number of bacteria present in the uterus, and the acute phase protein response. swabs (n = 328) were collected from the uterine lumen of dairy cattle, 21 and 28 days postpartum, vaginal mucus was scored for character and odour, and blood samples collected for acute phase protein measurement. bacteria were identified following aerobic and anaerobic culture, and the bacterial growth density was scored semi-quantitatively. when bacteria were categorised by their expected pathogenic potential in the uterus, purulent or fetid odour vaginal mucus was associated with the growth density of pathogenic bacteria but not opportunist contaminants. when bacteria were analysed independently, arcanobacterium pyogenes, proteus and fusobacterium necrophorum growth densities were associated with mucopurulent or purulent vaginal mucus. the bacterial growth densities for a. pyogenes, escherichia coli, non-hemolytic streptococci, and mannheimia haemolytica were associated with a fetid mucus odour. peripheral plasma concentrations of alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein were higher if there was a fetid compared with a normal vaginal mucus odour (1.50 +/- 0.09 mg/ml versus 1.05 +/- 0.02 mg/ml, p < 0.001), but did not differ significantly between vaginal mucus character scores. the evaluation of the character and odour of vaginal mucus reflects the number of bacteria in the uterus, and the acute phase protein response.

AB == this study was conducted from 1994 to 2001 to determine the susceptibility of bovine pathogenic bacteria to marbofloxacin (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). strains originated in bovine diseases from eight european countries. they were isolated from gut infections (escherichia coli, salmonellae), mastitis (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae) and respiratory diseases (mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus somnus). there was no change in the mic distributions for each species after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1997. in e. coli, a resistant population was present before the use of marbofloxacin having been induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. over this period the only a significant change seen was an increase in mic(90) of e. coli from the gut (1.275 microg/ml in 1994/1995 to 5.098 microg/ml in 2001). all the salmonellae were susceptible to marbofloxacin with a mic(90) = 0.073 microg/ml in 2001 without development of high level resistance. the use of marbofloxacin seems not to have favoured a significant increase and spreading of resistant bacteria.

TI == otitis in cattle, an aetiological review.
AB == otitis externa in cattle has a significant impact in tropical and subtropical regions, and the aetiological agents are predominantly rhabditiform nematodes and mites of the genus raillietia. its prevalence is higher in mature and zebu cattle. in advanced clinical cases there can be irreversible and fatal neural lesions. ear infection in calves has been associated with concurrent respiratory diseases and mixed infection. the principal reported agents of otitis in calves are bacteria such as actinomyces spp., corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, escherichia coli, haemophilus somnus, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas spp., streptococcus spp. and mycoplasma bovis. the control and treatment of bovine otitis is not standardized and there is little evidence-based support for the diverse treatments available in the literature.

TI == in vitro activities of florfenicol against bovine and porcine respiratory tract pathogens.
AB == florfenicol in vitro activities for a total of 756 bacterial isolates from respiratory tract infections of cattle and swine were comparatively investigated by the agar diffusion method and the microdilution broth method. florfenicol showed high in vitro activity against pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and streptococcus suis, with all of the isolates inhibited by </=2 micro g of florfenicol per ml.

TI == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
AB == aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.

TI == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI == [pneumonia in calves: characterization of the bacterial spectrum and the resistance patterns to antimicrobial drugs].
AB == the population under study included young calves with pneumonia (group a, n = 13) and their controls (group b, n = 9), as well as older calves from which the lungs with (group c, n = 90) or without (group d, n = 10) lesions were collected after slaughter. arcanobacterium pyogenes was the organism most commonly isolated from calves in group a (46%), followed by haemophilus somnus (23%), mannheimia haemolytica (15%), streptococcus suis and pasteurella multocida (7.7% each). only s. suis (22%) and p. multocida (11%) were found in group b. p. multocida was isolated from 32% group c calves, h. somnus from 11%, a. pyogenes from 7.8%, m. haemolytica from 2.2% and s. suis from 1.1%. no specific pathogens were isolated in group d. prevalence of mycoplasma bovis infection was 69% in group a and 37% in group c. ninety-eight strains were tested for resistance to antibiotics. resistance to penicillin and ampicillin was present only in m. haemolytica (46%). high percentages of resistant strains were observed for streptomycin (48-100%), tetracycline (15-43%), sulfonamides alone (14-100%) or in combination with trimethoprim (0-100%). therapeutic approaches to bacterial calf pneumonia in the area under study should be modified according to the isolated bacterial population, the observed antimicrobial resistances and the growing importance of mycoplasma bovis.

TI == development and characterisation of a model of bovine inflammation.
AB == two dialysis sacs each containing 50 ml dextran sulphate solution were implanted  into the peritoneal cavities of five three month-old calves. one sac was inoculated with pasteurella haemolytica or streptococcus uberis and the second sac served as an uninoculated control. samples of sac fluid removed after 0, four, six, eight, 15, 24, 36 and 48 hours and then at 24 hour intervals after inoculation revealed bacterial growth up to 9.0 log10 cfu ml-1 by two to three days after inoculation. concentrations of 25 to 48 ng ml-1 of the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin e2 (pge2) were detected six to 96 hours after inoculation, similar amounts being generated in sacs inoculated with either bacterium, but the concentrations in control sacs remained below 10 ng ml-4 over the seven day experiment. post mortem, a tissue cast invested each of the inoculated sacs. histologically, the reaction was an acute inflammatory response similar to that evoked by each bacterium in the target organ.

TI == aortic graft infection due to pasteurella haemolytica and group c beta-hemolytic  streptococcus.
AB == although infection is a rare complication of aortic bypass grafting, we treated a 50-year-old patient who developed aortic graft infection due to pasteurella haemolytica and group c beta-hemolytic streptococcus. the source of the infection could not be verified; however, after removal of the infected graft and administration of a 6-week course of intravenous ampicillin, he recovered fully. we discuss the etiology and pathogenesis of this rare infection.
