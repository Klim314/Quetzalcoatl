TI  == microbial diversity and flavor formation in onion fermentation.
AB  == fermented onion products are popular in many countries. we conducted fermentation with and without salt to identify the microorganisms responsible for onion fermentation and the unique taste of fermented onion. the results of pcr-dgge (polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) revealed that lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus zymae, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum), acetic acid bacteria (acetobacter pasteurianus, a. orientalis), citric acid bacteria (citrobacter sp., c. freundii), and yeasts (candida humilis, kazachstania exigua, saccharomyces boulardii) were the dominant microorganisms involved in onion fermentation. organic acid analysis indicated that lactic acid  and acetic acid significantly increased after fermentation. there were no significant changes in the types of amino acids after fermentation, but the total concentration of amino acids significantly decreased after fermentation with salt. the increase in esters, alcohols, and aldehydes after fermentation was responsible for the unique flavor of fermented onion. fermentation with salt inhibited the accumulation of organic acids and limited the conversion of proteins into amino acids but maintained the unique odor of onion by limiting the degradation of sulfur-containing compounds.

TI  == bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes from a greek vineyard.
AB  == grape bacterial microbiota plays central roles in the quality of grapes and wine, yet its diversity remains poorly described. in the present study, bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes of two cultivars originating from the same vineyard were assessed. isolates were identified by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and sequence analysis of partial 16s rrna gene. comparable counts were recorded between botrytis-infected  and sound grape samples. in all cases, the majority of isolates belonged to different species of enterobacteriaceae. the dominant species in the vineyard was klebsiella oxytoca that was found in different combinations with citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., erwinia sp., pantoea dispersa, tatumella ptyseos or  other species. in fermenting musts, those populations declined while other species evolved, like lactobacillus plantarum and enterobacter ludwigii. populations in botrytised samples persisted longer during spontaneous fermentations. present study suggests that bacterial diversity on grapes may be wider than previously described.
