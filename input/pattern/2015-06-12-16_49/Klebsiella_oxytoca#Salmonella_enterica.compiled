TI  - Removal of pathogenic bacterial biofilms by combinations of oxidizing compounds.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are commonly formed on medical devices and food processing surfaces. The antimicrobials used have limited efficacy against the biofilms; therefore, new strategies to prevent and remove these structures are needed. Here, the effectiveness of brief oxidative treatments, based on the combination of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of copper sulfate (CuSO4), were evaluated against bacterial laboratory strains and clinical isolates, both in planktonic and biofilm states. Simultaneous application of oxidants synergistically inactivated planktonic cells and prevented biofilm formation of laboratory Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus strains, as well as clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, Klebsiella oxytoca, and uropathogenic E. coli. In addition, preformed biofilms of E. coli C, Salmonella Typhimurium, K. pneumoniae, and Salmonella enterica exposed to treatments were removed by applying 12 mg/L NaClO, 0.1 mmol/L CuSO4, and 350 mmol/L H2O2 for 5 min. Klebsiella oxytoca and Staphylococcus aureus required a 5-fold increase in NaClO concentration, and the E. coli clinical isolate remained unremovable unless treatments were applied on biofilms formed within 24 h instead of 48 h. The application of treatments that last a few minutes using oxidizing compounds at low concentrations represents an interesting disinfection strategy against pathogens associated with medical and industrial settings.
TI  - Characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  - A total of 788 clinical Enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (AME genes) and to characterize the plasmids that carry these genes. Among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 Escherichia coli (80%), 33 Proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six K. oxytoca (1.8%), five Enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three Morganella morganii (0.9%), three Providencia stuartii (0.9%), two Salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each Citrobacter freundii, C. koseri, Proteus vulgaris, and Shigella sonnei. The most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). The AME genes found were aph(3'')-Ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-Ia (37.5%), aph(3')-Ia (13.9%), aac(3)-IIa (12.4%), aac(6')-Ib (4.2%), ant(2'')-Ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-IIa (1.2%). Thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. The most frequent association was ant(3'')-Ia plus aph(3'')-Ib (35 strains). From 66 selected AME genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-IIa, six aph(3')-Ia, three ant(3'')-Ia, two ant(2'')-Ia, and one aac(6')-Ib. These genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups F, FIA, FIB, or HI2. In conclusion, the AME genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib, and ant(2'')-Ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
TI  - Detection of Enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a DNA microarray.
AB  - Pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (PIF). An obstacle associated with PIF microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. We have developed a rapid, DNA microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with PIF contamination based on the 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences and wzy (O antigen polymerase) gene. Using this procedure, Enterobacter sakazakii, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli O157 were identified. One hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). Twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic DNA or 10(4) CFU/ml). Twenty-one real PIF samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. The data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.
TI  - CMY-31 and CMY-36 cephalosporinases encoded by ColE1-like plasmids.
AB  - Two CMY-2 derivatives, CMY-31 (Gln(215)-->Arg) from Salmonella enterica serotype  Newport and CMY-36 (Ala(77)-->Cys and Gln(193)-->Glu) from Klebsiella pneumoniae, were characterized. Both cephalosporinases functionally resembled CMY-2. bla(CMY) alleles occurred as parts of a putative transposon comprising ISEcp1B and a Citrobacter freundii-derived sequence carried by ColE1-like plasmids similar to CMY-5-encoding pTKH11 from Klebsiella oxytoca.
TI  - Prevalence of clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. producing multiple extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - Eleven thousand two hundred seventy-two Escherichia coli, 1109 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1124 Salmonella enterica, and 602 Klebsiella oxytoca unrelated clinical isolates were obtained between 2001 and 2004 in a university hospital in Salamanca, Spain. One hundred thirteen E. coli (1%), 32 K. pneumoniae (2.9%), 4 K. oxytoca (0.66%), and 5 S. enterica (0.44%) isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). We obtained 42.2% of the ESBL-producing isolates from outpatients and 57.8% from inpatients. The most commonly detected ESBLs were CTX-M 14 (43.5% of ESBL-producing isolates), TEM-116 (22.1%), and SHV-2 (15.6%). A CTX-M 27-producing E. coli is 1st reported in Spain in this study. Two (20 isolates, 13%) or 3 (7 isolates, 4.5%) ESBLs were produced by 17.5% of ESBL-producing isolates (27 isolates). The most frequent combinations were CTX-M 14 + TEM-116 (5.7%), SHV-12 + TEM-116 (2.6%), and SHV-2 + CTX-M 14 + TEM-116 (2.6%). Clonal diversity was high even between isolates producing the same combinations of 2 or 3 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Replicon typing of plasmids encoding resistance to newer beta-lactams.
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction-based replicon typing represents a novel method to describe the dissemination and follow the evolution of resistance plasmids. We used this approach to study 26 epidemiologically unrelated Enterobacteriaceae and demonstrate the dominance of incompatibility (Inc) A/C or Inc N-related plasmids carrying some emerging resistance determinants to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems.
TI  - Emergence of DHA-1-producing Klebsiella spp. in the Parisian region: genetic organization of the ampC and ampR genes originating from Morganella morganii.
AB  - Eleven Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates and one Klebsiella oxytoca clinical isolate showing various pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types and producing an inducible DHA-1 class C beta-lactamase were isolated in the Parisian region between 1998 and 2003. The aim of this study was to compare the genetic organization of the bla(DHA-1) genes in this collection of clinical isolates. In four isolates, the Morganella morganii-derived genomic region containing bla(DHA-1) was inserted in an entire complex sul1-type integron, including a region common to In6-In7 (CR1), as previously described in a bla(DHA-1)-producing Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis KF92 isolate from Saudi Arabia in 1992. Different gene cassette arrays were characterized in each of these integrons. In two of them, an additional 10-kb fragment was inserted between the CR1 and the M. morganii-derived region and was similar to the sap (ABC transporter family) and psp (phage shock protein) operons originated from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The length of the M. morganii region was variable, suggesting that several independent recombination events have occurred and that open reading frame orf513 encodes a recombinase involved in the mobilization of the resistance genes. The genetic organization of bla(DHA-1) was identical in the eight other isolates. This structure is likely derived from a complex integron following the insertion of IS26, leading to the deletion of the first part of integron. The horizontal transfer of one plasmid carrying that truncated integron was shown for seven of these isolates.
TI  - Six groups of the OXY beta-Lactamase evolved over millions of years in Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - The diversity and evolution of the class A OXY beta-lactamase from Klebsiella oxytoca were investigated and compared to housekeeping gene diversity. The entire bla(OXY) coding region was sequenced in 18 clinical isolates representative of the four K. oxytoca beta-lactamase gene groups bla(OXY-1) to bla(OXY-4) and of two new groups identified here, bla(OXY-5) (with four isolates with pI 7.2 and one with pI 7.7) and bla(OXY-6) (with four isolates with pI 7.75 and three with pI 8.1). Genes bla(OXY-5) and bla(OXY-6) showed 99.8% within-group nucleotide similarity but differed from each other by 4.2% and from bla(OXY-1), their closest relative, by 2.5% and 2.9%, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility to beta-lactams was similar among OXY groups. Nucleotide sequence diversity of the 16S rRNA (1,454 bp), rpoB (940 bp), gyrA (383 bp), and gapDH (573 bp) genes was in agreement with the beta-lactamase gene phylogeny. Strains with bla(OXY-1), bla(OXY-2), bla(OXY-3), bla(OXY-4), and bla(OXY-6) genes formed five phylogenetic groups, named KoI, KoII, KoIII, KoIV, and KoVI, respectively. Isolates harboring bla(OXY-5) appeared to represent an emerging lineage within KoI. We estimated that the bla(OXY) gene has been evolving within K. oxytoca for approximately 100 million years, using as calibration the 140-million-year estimation of the Escherichia coli-Salmonella enterica split. These results show that the bla(OXY) gene has diversified along K. oxytoca phylogenetic lines over long periods of time without concomitant evolution of the antimicrobial resistance phenotype.
TI  - DNA sequence analysis of regions surrounding blaCMY-2 from multiple Salmonella plasmid backbones.
AB  - The emergence in the United States of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) within the salmonellae has been associated primarily with three large (>100-kb) plasmids (designated types A, B, and C) and one 10.1-kb plasmid (type D) that carry the blaCMY-2 gene. In the present study, the distribution of these four known blaCMY-2-carrying plasmids among 35 ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella isolates obtained from 1998 to 2001 was examined. Twenty-three of these isolates were Salmonella enterica serotype Newport, 10 were Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, 1 was Salmonella enterica serotype Agona, and 1 was Salmonella enterica serotype Reading. All 23 serotype Newport isolates carried a type C plasmid, and 5, 4, and 1 serovar Typhimurium isolate carried type B, A, and C plasmids, respectively. Both the serotype Agona and serotype Reading isolates carried type A plasmids. None of the isolates carried a type D plasmid. Hybridization data suggested that plasmid types A and C were highly related replicons. DNA sequencing revealed that the region surrounding blaCMY-2 was highly conserved in all three plasmid types analyzed (types B, C, and D) and was related to a region surrounding blaCMY-5 from the Klebsiella oxytoca plasmid pTKH11. These findings are consistent with a model in which blaCMY-2 has been disseminated primarily through plasmid transfer, and not by mobilization of the gene itself, to multiple Salmonella chromosomal backbones.
TI  - The genes and enzymes for the catabolism of galactitol, D-tagatose, and related carbohydrates in Klebsiella oxytoca M5a1 and other enteric bacteria display convergent evolution.
AB  - Enteric bacteria (Enteriobacteriaceae) carry on their single chromosome about 4000 genes that all strains have in common (referred to here as "obligatory genes"), and up to 1300 "facultative" genes that vary from strain to strain and from species to species. In closely related species, obligatory and facultative genes are orthologous genes that are found at similar loci. We have analyzed a set of facultative genes involved in the degradation of the carbohydrates galactitol, D-tagatose, D-galactosamine and N-acetyl-galactosamine in various pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of these bacteria. The four carbohydrates are transported into the cell by phosphotransferase (PTS) uptake systems, and are metabolized by closely related or even identical catabolic enzymes via pathways that share several intermediates. In about 60% of Escherichia coli strains the genes for galactitol degradation map to a gat operon at 46.8 min. In strains of Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, the corresponding gat genes, although orthologous to their E. coli counterparts, are found at 70.7 min, clustered in a regulon together with three tag genes for the degradation of D-tagatose, an isomer of D-fructose. In contrast, in all the E. coli strains tested, this chromosomal site was found to be occupied by an aga/kba gene cluster for the degradation of D-galactosamine and N-acetyl-galactosamine. The aga/kba and the tag genes were paralogous either to the gat cluster or to the fru genes for degradation of D-fructose. Finally, in more then 90% of strains of both Klebsiella species, and in about 5% of the E. coli strains, two operons were found at 46.8 min that comprise paralogous genes for catabolism of the isomers D-arabinitol (genes atl or dal) and ribitol (genes rtl or rbt). In these strains gat genes were invariably absent from this location, and they were totally absent in S. enterica. These results strongly indicate that these various gene clusters and metabolic pathways have been subject to convergent evolution among the Enterobacteriaceae. This apparently involved recent horizontal gene transfer and recombination events, as indicated by major chromosomal rearrangements found in their immediate vicinity.
TI  - [Alteration of phagocyte functional activity depending on the presence of pR50 plasmid in bacteria].
AB  - The relationship between the presence, or the absence, of conjugative plasmid pR50 detected in Klebsiella oxytoca 89, in the isogenic pairs of attenuated strains Shigella flexneri 2a 516 Near and Salmonella typhimurium 129 Rifr and the regeneration of the active forms of oxygen by mouse peritoneal phagocytizing cells was studied. As indicated by the data obtained in the course of the experiment, plasmids pR50 could influence the chemiluminescent response of phagocytes. The inhibition of the synthesis of oxygen metabolites was found to occur at the primary stage of the infectious process, that later this synthesis increased, that facilitated the survival of the animals infected with the cultures carrying plasmid pR50.
TI  - Structural requirements of the mRNA for intracistronic translation initiation of  the enterobacterial infB gene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gene infB encodes the prokaryotic translation initiation factor IF2, a central macromolecular component in the formation of the ribosomal 70S initiation complex. In Escherichia coli, infB encodes three forms of IF2: IF2alpha, IF2beta and IF2gamma. The expression of IF2beta and IF2gamma is a tandem translation from intact infB mRNA and not merely a translation of post-transcriptionally truncated mRNA. The molecular mechanism responsible for the ribosomal recognition of the two intracistronic translation initiation sites in E. coli infB is not well characterized. RESULTS: We found three different forms of IF2 in Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella typhimurium, and two different forms in Proteus vulgaris. We identified the intracistronic translation initiation sites of the mRNA by isolation and N-terminal sequencing of the shorter isoforms of IF2 in S. enterica and S. typhimurium. A further search in the readily available public sequence databases revealed that infB from Yersinia pestis also contains an intracistronic in-frame initiation site used for the translation of IF2beta. The base composition in a part of the 5' end of the DNA coding strand of the enterobacterial infB gene shows a strong preference for adenine (A) over thymine (T) with a maximum ratio of A-to-T around the intracistronic initiation sites. We demonstrate that the mRNA has an open structure around the ribosomal binding region. CONCLUSION: Efficient intracistronic translation initiation of the infB gene is suggested to require an mRNA with this special base composition that results in an open, single-stranded structure at the ribosomal binding region.
TI  - Characterisation of the diol dehydratase pdu operon of Lactobacillus collinoides.
AB  - The three genes (pduCDE) encoding the diol dehydratase of Lactobacillus collinoides were sequenced. They exhibited strong identities with the ddrABC and pduCDE genes of Klebsiella oxytoca and Salmonella enterica, respectively. These genes are part of a putative operon with at least four other genes. An eighth open reading frame was identified as homologous to the pocR gene (encoding the operon regulatory protein). Although the enzyme was detected in exponential growth phase, PduCDE activity was increased at the end of exponential phase in presence of 1,2-propanediol.
TI  - CMY-2-producing Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains isolated in Spain (October 1999-December 2000).
AB  - CMY-2 plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (CMY-2) was detected in 21 isolates from two hospitals located in different geographical regions of Spain between October 1999 and December 2000. The isolates comprised two Salmonella enterica serovars (Mikawasima and Montevideo), 16 Escherichia coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Klebsiella oxytoca and one Proteus mirabilis. In addition to the expected resistance to beta-lactams, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins and cefoxitin, all isolates showed a broad spectrum of associated resistance. All were resistant to sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and streptomycin, and all but two were also resistant to gentamicin. Five isolates were studied in detail and all transferred CMY-2 and other resistance determinants by conjugation. Genomic DNA restriction pattern analysis of the E. coli isolates excluded the dissemination of a single clone. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that CMY-2 has been detected in P. mirabilis, K. oxytoca and S. enterica serovars Mikawasima and Montevideo. It is also the first time that CMY-2 has been described in Spain.
TI  - Transposition of IS1397 in the family Enterobacteriaceae and first characterization of ISKpn1, a new insertion sequence associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae palindromic units.
AB  - IS1397 and ISKpn1 are IS3 family members which are specifically inserted into the loop of palindromic units (PUs). IS1397 is shown to transpose into PUs with sequences close or identical to the Escherichia coli consensus, even in other enterobacteria (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca). Moreover, we show that homologous intergenic regions containing PUs constitute IS1397 transpositional hot spots, despite bacterial interspersed mosaic element structures that differ among the three species. ISKpn1, described here for the first time, is specific for PUs from K. pneumoniae, in which we discovered it. A sequence comparison between the two insertion sequences allowed us to define a motif possibly accounting for their specificity.
TI  - Identification and functional characterization of arylamine N-acetyltransferases  in eubacteria: evidence for highly selective acetylation of 5-aminosalicylic acid.
AB  - Arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity has been described in various bacterial species. Bacterial N-acetyltransferases, including those from bacteria of the gut flora, may be involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, thereby exerting physiopathological effects. We characterized these enzymes further by steady-state kinetics, time-dependent inhibition, and DNA hybridization in 40 species, mostly from the human intestinal microflora. We report for the first time N-acetyltransferase activity in 11 species of Proteobacteriaceae from seven genera: Citrobacter amalonaticus, Citrobacter farmeri, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella ozaenae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Shigella flexneri, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Vibrio cholerae. We estimated apparent kinetic parameters and found that 5-aminosalicylic acid, a compound efficient in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, was acetylated with a catalytic efficiency 27 to 645 times higher than that for its isomer, 4-aminosalicylic acid. In contrast, para-aminobenzoic acid, a folate precursor in bacteria, was poorly acetylated. Of the wild-type strains studied, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the best acetylator in terms of both substrate spectrum and catalytic efficiency. DNA hybridization with a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-derived probe suggested the presence of this enzyme in eight proteobacterial and four gram-positive species. Molecular aspects together with the kinetic data suggest distinct functional features for this class of microbial enzymes.
TI  - Identification of a non-haem catalase in Salmonella and its regulation by RpoS (sigmaS).
AB  - We report the identification and functional analysis of katN, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. katN, which is not present in Escherichia coli, is located between the yciGFE and yciD E. coli homologues in the Salmonella genome. Its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 Da and is similar to the Mn-catalases of Lactobacillus plantarum and Thermus spp. Its product, KatN, was visualized as a 37 kDa protein in E. coli maxicells. A KatN recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its C-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. KatN was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. Its expression was shown to be regulated by growth phase and rpoS. Northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream yciGFE genes. A putative rpoS-regulated promoter was identified upstream of yciG. Southern blotting revealed that katN is conserved within Salmonella serovars. katN homologues were found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. A katN mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) response of Salmonella. However, the expression of katN increased the H2O2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpoS mutants in stationary phase. Thus, KatN may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in Salmonella in certain environmental conditions.
TI  - Two novel plasmid-mediated cefotaxime-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases (CTX-M-5 and CTX-M-6) from Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Two novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (CTX-M-5 and CTX-M-6) produced by Salmonella typhimurium clinical strains were characterized. The enzymes exhibited a pI of 8.4, hydrolyzed oxyimino-beta-lactams and were susceptible to mechanism-based beta-lactamase inhibitors. The respective bla genes were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences showed a high degree of homology with those of the previously described plasmid class A CTX-M-type enzymes and appeared related to the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella oxytoca.
TI  - Sequence of the gene encoding a plasmid-mediated cefotaxime-hydrolyzing class A beta-lactamase (CTX-M-4): involvement of serine 237 in cephalosporin hydrolysis.
AB  - The sequence of the gene encoding a novel cefotaxime-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase (CTX-M-4) was determined. It was located in a plasmid harbored by a Salmonella typhimurium strain. CTX-M-4 was similar to the plasmidic cefotaxime-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases CTX-M-2 and Toho-1 and related to the chromosomal beta-lactamase of Klebsiella oxytoca. A Ser-237-->Ala substitution, introduced by site-directed mutagenesis, caused minor alterations in the interaction of CTX-M-4 with beta-lactams, reducing slightly the relative hydrolytic activity against cefotaxime and the susceptibility to inhibition by clavulanate.
TI  - Propanediol utilization genes (pdu) of Salmonella typhimurium: three genes for the propanediol dehydratase.
AB  - The propanediol utilization (pdu) operon of Salmonella typhimurium encodes proteins required for the catabolism of propanediol, including a coenzyme B12-dependent propanediol dehydratase. A clone that expresses propanediol dehydratase activity was isolated from a Salmonella genomic library. DNA sequence analysis showed that the clone included part of the pduF gene, the pduABCDE genes, and a long partial open reading frame (ORF1). The clone included 3.9 kbp of pdu DNA which had not been previously sequenced. Complementation and expression studies with subclones constructed via PCR showed that three genes (pduCDE) are necessary and sufficient for propanediol dehydratase activity. The function of ORF1 was not determined. Analyses showed that the S. typhimurium propanediol dehydratase was related to coenzyme B12-dependent glycerol dehydratases from Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Unexpectedly, the S. typhimurium propanediol dehydratase was found to be 98% identical in amino acid sequence to the Klebsiella oxytoca propanediol dehydratase; this is a much higher identity than expected, given the relationship between these organisms. DNA sequence analyses also supported previous studies indicating that the pdu operon was inherited along with the adjacent cobalamin biosynthesis operon by a single horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - Sequences of beta-lactamase genes encoding CTX-M-1 (MEN-1) and CTX-M-2 and relationship of their amino acid sequences with those of other beta-lactamases.
AB  - Amino acid sequences determined either by protein sequencing or by DNA sequencing are identical for cefotaximases CTX-M-1 and MEN-1, whereas CTX-M-2 is 84% identical to CTX-M-1/MEN-1. Both beta-lactamases are distantly related to other plasmidic class A enzymes (homology to TEM-1 is 38.1% for CTX-M-1/MEN-1 and 36.5% for CTX-M-2); the closest relationship was with the chromosomal beta-lactamase of Klebsiella oxytoca E23004 (homologies of 74.5% for CTX-M-1/MEN-1 and 77.9% for CTX-M-2). The cefotaximases CTX-M-1/MEN-1 and CTX-M-2 represent two members of a new subgroup of plasmidic class A beta-lactamases.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Thirty-two strains of Pseudomonas and 960 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Salmonella enterica). Tigemonam displayed good activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were as follows: MIC50S were 0.01 mg/L for P. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/L for S. marcescens, MIC90S were 0.03 mg/L for P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and 4 mg/L for Citrobacter freundii. Tigemonam inhibited E. coli and P. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. Despite MIC90S of 9.5 and 4 mg/L for Enterobacter and C. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. Tigemonam was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC50S and MIC90S higher than 128 mg/L (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/L). Tigemonam's activity was found to be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. Of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against P. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (MIC90, 8 mg/L for norfloxacin; MIC50, 8 mg/L and MIC90, 32 mg/L for aztreonam). Cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested.
