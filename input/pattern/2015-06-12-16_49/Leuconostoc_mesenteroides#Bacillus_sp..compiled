TI  - Microbiological and chemical characteristics of taruba, an indigenous beverage produced from solid cassava fermentation.
AB  - The aim of this work was to identify and characterize the microbiota present during fermentation and in the final beverage, taruba, by culture-dependent and -independent methods. In addition, target chemical compounds (carbohydrates, organic acids, and ethanol) were evaluated. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and mesophilic bacteria were the predominant microorganisms. Among them, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus subtilis were frequently isolated and detected by DGGE analysis. Torulaspora delbrueckii was the dominant yeast species. Yeast isolates Pichia exigua, Candida rugosa, T. delbrueckii, Candida tropicalis, Pichia kudriavzevii, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, and Candida ethanolica and bacteria isolates Lb. plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus sp., and Chitinophaga terrae showed amylolytic activity. Only isolates of P. exigua and T. delbrueckii and all species of the genus Bacillus identified in this work exhibited proteolytic activity. All microbial isolates grew at 38 degrees C, and only the isolates belonging to Hanseniaspora uvarum species did not grow at 42 degrees C. These characteristics are important for further development of starter cultures; isolates of T. delbrueckii, P. exigua, and Bacillus species identified in this work displayed all of these properties and are potential strains for use as starter culture in cassava fermented food.
TI  - Removal of odorous compounds from poultry manure by microorganisms on perlite--bentonite carrier.
AB  - Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted using poultry manure (PM) from a laying hen farm. Six strains of bacteria and one strain of yeast, selected on the base of the previous study, were investigated to evaluate their activity in the removal of odorous compounds from poultry manure: pure cultures of Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii LOCK 0272, Bacillus megaterium LOCK 0963, Pseudomonas sp. LOCK 0961, Psychrobacter faecalis LOCK 0965, Leuconostoc mesenteroides LOCK 0964, Streptomyces violaceoruber LOCK 0967, and Candida inconspicua LOCK 0272 were suspended in water solution and applied for PM deodorization. The most active strains in the removal of volatile odorous compounds (ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, isobutyric acid) belonged to B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii, L. mesenteroides, C. inconspicua, and P. faecalis. In the next series of experiments, a mixed culture of all tested strains was immobilized on a mineral carrier being a mixture of perlite and bentonite (20:80 by weight). That mixed culture applied for PM deodorization was particularly active against ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which were removed from the exhaust gas by 20.8% and 17.5%, respectively. The experiments also showed that during deodorization the microorganisms could reduce the concentrations of proteins and amino acids in PM. In particular, the mixed culture was active against cysteine and methionine, which were removed from PM by around 45% within 24 h of deodorization.
TI  - Cultivable endophytic bacteria from leaf bases of Agave tequilana and their role  as plant growth promoters.
AB  - Agave tequilana Weber var. 'Azul' is grown for the production of tequila, inulin  and syrup. Diverse bacteria inhabit plant tissues and play a crucial role for plant health and growth. In this study culturable endophytic bacteria were extracted from leaf bases of 100 healthy Agave tequilana plants. In plant tissue bacteria occurred at mean population densities of 3 million CFU/g of fresh plant tissue. Three hundred endophytic strains were isolated and 16s rDNA sequences grouped the bacteria into eight different taxa that shared high homology with other known sequences. Bacterial endophytes were identified as Acinectobacter sp., A. baumanii, A. bereziniae, Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter hormaechei, Bacillus sp. Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus casseliflavus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and Gluconobacter oxydans. Isolates were confirmed to be plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) by their capacities for nitrogen fixation, auxin production, phosphate solubilization, or antagonism against Fusarium oxysporum AC132. E. casseliflavus JM47 and K. oxytoca JM26 secreted the highest concentrations of IAA. The endophyte Acinectobacter sp. JM58 exhibited the maximum values for nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization index (PSI). Inhibition of fungi was found in Pseudomonas sp. JM9p and K. oxytoca JM26. Bacterial endophytes show promise for use as bio-inoculants for agave cultivation. Use of endophytes to enhance cultivation of agave may be particularly important for plants produced by micropropagation techniques, where native endophytes may have been lost.
TI  - Application of universal stress proteins in probing the dynamics of potent degraders in complex terephthalate metagenome.
AB  - The culture-independent strategies to study microbial diversity and function have led to a revolution in environmental genomics, enabling fundamental questions about the distribution of microbes and their influence on bioremediation to be addressed. In this research we used the expression of universal stress proteins as a probe to determine the changes in degrading microbial population from a highly toxic terephthalate wastewater to a less toxic activated sludge bioreactor. The impact of relative toxicities was significantly elaborated at the levels of genus and species. The results indicated that 23 similar prokaryotic phyla were represented in both metagenomes irrespective of their relative abundance. Furthermore, the following bacteria taxa Micromonosporaceae, Streptomyces, Cyanothece sp. PCC 7822, Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius, Bacillus halodurans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactococcus garvieae, Brucellaceae, Ralstonia solanacearum, Verminephrobacter eiseniae, Azoarcus, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Francisella tularensis, Methanothermus fervidus, and Methanocorpusculum labreanum were represented only in the activated sludge bioreactor. These highly dynamic microbes could serve as taxonomic biomarkers for toxic thresholds related to terephthalate and its derivatives. This paper, highlights the application of universal stress proteins in metagenomics analysis. Dynamics of microbial consortium of this nature can have future in biotechnological applications in bioremediation of toxic chemicals and radionuclides.
TI  - Combined effect of dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) and nisin on indigenous microorganisms of litchi juice and its microbial shelf life.
AB  - The individual and combined influences of dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) and nisin (200 IU/mL) at mild heat on the inactivation of indigenous microorganisms in litchi juice, including bacteria, molds and yeasts (M&Y), were investigated. The fresh litchi juice with or without nisin were exposed to 250 mg/L DMDC at 30, 40, or 45 degrees C for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 h. A complete inactivation of M&Y in the litchi juice with or without nisin was achieved as exposed to 250 mg/L DMDC at 30, 40, or 45 degrees C for 0.5 h. The bacteria, especially Bacillus sp. and Leuconstoc mesenteroides showed higher resistance than M&Y in the litchi juice. Bacillus sp. and Leuconstoc mesenteroides in the litchi juice was not completely inactivated by 250 mg/L DMDC at 30, 40, or 45 degrees C. However, nisin addition can enhanced the inactivation of these bacteria by DMDC, and nisin and DMDC also showed a synergistic effect on the inactivation of bacteria. M&Y and bacteria were not detected in the litchi juice added with 200 IU/mL nisin as exposed to 250 mg/L DMDC at 45 degrees C for 3 h. In addition, microbial shelf life of the litchi juice during storage at 4 degrees C also was evaluated as treated by 250 mg/L DMDC or combination with nisin at 45 degrees C for 3 h.
TI  - Identification and characterization of leucocyclicin Q, a novel cyclic bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides TK41401.
AB  - The culture supernatant of Leuconostoc mesenteroides TK41401, isolated from Japanese pickles, possessed antimicrobial activity against broad range of a bacterial genera and particularly strong activity against Bacillus coagulans, the major contaminant of pickles. An antimicrobial peptide was purified in three chromatographic steps, and its molecular mass was determined to be 6,115.59 Da by electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF MS). The primary structure of this peptide was determined by amino acid and DNA sequencing, and these analyses revealed that it was translated as a 63-residue precursor. This precursor showed high similarity to the precursor of lactocyclicin Q, a cyclic bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. strain QU 12. The molecular weight calculated after cyclization, which was presumed to involve the same process as in lactocyclicin Q (between L3 and W63), agreed with that estimated by ESI-TOF MS. This peptide was proved to be a novel cyclic bacteriocin, and it was termed leucocyclicin Q. The antimicrobial spectrum of this bacteriocin clearly differed from that of lactocyclicin Q, even though their primary structures were quite similar. This is the first report of a cyclic bacteriocin produced by a strain of the genus Leuconostoc.
TI  - Chlorine dioxide against bacteria and yeasts from the alcoholic fermentation.
AB  - The ethanol production in Brazil is carried out by fed-batch or continuous process with cell recycle, in such way that bacterial contaminants are also recycled and may be troublesome due to the substrate competition. Addition of sulphuric acid when inoculum cells are washed can control the bacterial growth or alternatively biocides are used. This work aimed to verify the effect of chlorine dioxide, a well-known biocide for bacterial decontamination of water and equipments, against contaminant bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) from alcoholic fermentation, through the method of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), as well as its effect on the industrial yeast inoculum. Lower MIC was found for B. subtilis (10 ppm) and Leuconostoc mesenteroides (50 ppm) than for Lactobacillus fermentum (75 ppm) and Lactobacillus plantarum (125 ppm). Additionally, these concentrations of chlorine dioxide had similar effects on bacteria as 3 ppm of Kamoran(R) (recommended dosage for fermentation tanks), exception for B. subtilis, which could not be controlled at this Kamoran(R) dosage. The growth of industrial yeasts was affected when the concentration of chlorine dioxide was higher than 50 ppm, but the effect was slightly dependent on the type of yeast strain. Smooth yeast colonies (dispersed cells) seemed to be more sensitive than wrinkled yeast colonies (clustered cells/pseudohyphal growth), both isolated from an alcohol-producing unit during the 2006/2007 sugar cane harvest. The main advantage in the usage of chlorine dioxide that it can replace antibiotics, avoiding the selection of resistant populations of microorganisms.
TI  - Purification of alternanase by affinity chromatography.
AB  - The enzyme alternanase, produced by Bacillus sp. NRRL B-21195, hydrolyzes alternan, a polysaccharide produced by certain strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides that consists of glucose linked by alternating alpha(1-->6), alpha(1-->3) linkages. The main product of enzymatic hydrolysis by alternanase is a novel cyclic tetrasaccharide of glucose that also has alternating linkages between the glucose moieties. An improved purification scheme for alternanase has been developed that incorporates the use of isomaltosyl units linked to agarose for selectively binding the alternanase enzyme. Bound enzyme was eluted with 0.5 M sodium chloride and was nearly pure after this procedure. When followed by preparative isoelectric focusing, a single band of 117 kDa was measured when the purified protein was analyzed by HPLC size-exclusion chromatography/multiangle light scattering. The purification procedure can be scaled to permit large quantities of enzyme to be purified in high (36%) yield.
TI  - Distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  - Mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in January, April, July, and October from 1984 to 1989. Unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the Jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. Of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. From the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forPseudomonas syringae, followed byXanthomonas campestris (6.7%),Erwinia herbicola (6%),Acetobacter aceti (4.7%),Gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),Pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),Bacillus megaterium (3.8%),Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),Lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),Curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),Micrococcus luteus (2.2%),Arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),Klebsiella planticola (1.2%),Streptococcus faecium (1.2%),Clavibacter sp. (0.98%),Micrococcus sp. (0.82%),Serratia marcescens (0.81%),Bacillus subtilis (0.57%),Cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),Erwinia sp. (0.37%),Zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),Bacillus sp. (0.29%),Alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),Erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andPseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). Bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. Communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. The communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.
