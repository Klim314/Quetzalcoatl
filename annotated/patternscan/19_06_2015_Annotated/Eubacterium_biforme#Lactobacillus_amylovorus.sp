TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.

TI  == identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (trfps): a rapid, pcr-based method.
AB  == identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. we have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of a 16s rrna gene fragment using a pair of universal pcr primers.  the forward pcr primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-fam)  fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the pcr products after digestion with restriction enzymes. the pcr products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an  automated dna sequencer. the data was analysed with genescan software 2.1. eleven bacteria (eubacterium biforme, e. limosum, peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, c. perfringens and escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were  successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. this protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.

TI  == pcr detection and quantitation of predominant anaerobic bacteria in human and animal fecal samples.
AB  == pcr procedures based on 16s rrna gene sequences specific for 12 anaerobic bacteria that predominate in the human intestinal tract were developed and used for quantitative detection of these species in human (adult and baby) feces and animal (rat, mouse, cat, dog, monkey, and rabbit) feces. fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, and clostridium clostridiiforme had high pcr titers (the maximum dilutions for positive pcr results ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-8)) in all of the human and animal fecal samples tested. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, and eubacterium limosum also  showed higher pcr titers (10(-2) to 10(-6)) in adult human feces. the other bacteria tested, including escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, eubacterium biforme, and bacteroides distasonis, were either at low pcr titers (less than 10(-2)) or not detected by pcr. the reported pcr procedure including the fecal sample preparation method is simplified and rapid and eliminates the dna isolation steps.
