TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == production of wheat bread without preservatives using sourdough starters.
AB  == in order for the beneficial effects of sourdough application in breadmaking to take place a proper selection of lactic acid bacteria species and strains, an appropriate technology and effective control of the purity and activity of the selected cultures. four symbiotic starters for sourdough for the production of bread were developed and probated in a production laboratory using the selected strains lactobacillus brevis lbrz7, l. buchneri lbrz6, l. plantarum x2, l. paracasei rn5, l. sanfranciscensis r and l. fermentum lbrh10 and the probiotic strain propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327. the starter sourdoughs that include propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327 had greater antimicrobial activity against saprophytic microorganisms: bacillus subtilis, b. mesentericus, aspergillus niger, penicillium sp. and rhizopus sp., but none of them inhibited the growth of bakery yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae. it was established that in order to prevent bacterial spoilage 10% of the selected starter sourdoughs had to be added in the breadmaking process, while for prevention of mold spoilage the necessary amount of starter sourdough had to be between 15% and 20%.the application of the developed starters for the production of wheat bread guarantees longer shelf life and no adverse alterations in the features of the final bread.

TI  == examination of the technological properties of newly isolated strains of the genus and possibilities for their application in the composition of starters.
AB  == the ability of four lactobacillus strains - lactobacillus brevis lbrz7 (isolated  from fermented cabbage), lactobacillus plantarum lbrz12 (isolated from fermented  cabbage), lactobacillus fermentum lbrh9 (of human origin) and lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus lbrc11 (isolated from home-made cheese) - to grow in flour/water environment and to accumulate high concentrations of viable cells was examined. two starters for sourdough were created for lab-scale production of wheat bread:  a two-strain starter and a four-strain starter. wheat bread with improved properties - greater loaf volume, enhanced flavour and softer and brighter crumb  - was obtained from the 7% four-strain starter sourdough. the addition of sourdough in the production of wheat bread affected positively the technological  and organoleptic characteristics of the final bread by inhibiting the growth of wild yeasts and mold and bacillus spores without the addition of preservatives. the inclusion of 15% of the four-strain starter sourdough in the bread-making process led to enhanced safety and longer shelf life of the baked bread.

TI  == phenotypic identification and technological attributes of native lactic acid bacteria present in fermented bamboo shoot products from north-east india.
AB  == fermented bamboo shoots such as soibum, soidon, eup, hirring, hecche and ekung etc. are non-salted acidic products obtained by natural fermentation predominantly with lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, we have characterized 11-representative lab that includes, lactobacillus sp. (n = 2), lactobacillus plantarum (n = 3), and one each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus sp., lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, leuconostoc sp. and lactobacillus xylosus. subsequently, these cultures were studied for their technological and functional properties. different isolates exhibited variation in their activities. l. brevis showed maximum phytic acid degradation ability (19.33 u ml (-1) ). l. xylosus had highest protease activity (64.2 nmol/ml) and also exhibited lipolytic activity. in addition, degree of cell hydrophobicity among these cultures ranged between 12.5 and 93.48 % with l. plantarum (sm2) showing highest degree of activity. lactobacillus plantarum was the most common species found in the product studied. results indicated that most of the labs showed putative probiotic as well as antagonistic properties against the selected pathogenic bacteria. characteristic aroma, flavour and texture in the fermented bamboo shoot products could be attributed to presence of these new lab isolates.

TI  == fermented fruits and vegetables of asia: a potential source of probiotics.
AB  == as world population increases, lactic acid fermentation is expected to become an  important role in preserving fresh vegetables, fruits, and other food items for feeding humanity in developing countries. however, several fermented fruits and vegetables products (sauerkraut, kimchi, gundruk, khalpi, sinki, etc.) have a long history in human nutrition from ancient ages and are associated with the several social aspects of different communities. among the food items, fruits and vegetables are easily perishable commodities due to their high water activity and nutritive values. these conditions are more critical in tropical and subtropical  countries which favour the growth of spoilage causing microorganisms. lactic acid fermentation increases shelf life of fruits and vegetables and also enhances several beneficial properties, including nutritive value and flavours, and reduces toxicity. fermented fruits and vegetables can be used as a potential source of probiotics as they harbour several lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, l. pentosus, l. brevis, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, leuconostoc fallax, and l. mesenteroides. as a whole, the traditionally fermented fruits and vegetables not only serve as food supplements but also attribute towards health benefits. this review aims to describe some important asian fermented fruits and vegetables and their significance as a potential source of probiotics.

TI  == hydroxycinnamic acids used as external acceptors of electrons: an energetic advantage for strictly heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the metabolism of hydroxycinnamic acids by strictly heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (19 strains) was investigated as a potential alternative energy route. lactobacillus curvatus pe5 was the most tolerant to hydroxycinnamic acids, followed by strains of weissella spp., lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, for which the mic values were the same. the highest sensitivity was found for lactobacillus rossiae strains. during growth in mrs broth, lactic acid bacteria reduced caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids into dihydrocaffeic, phloretic, and dihydroferulic acids, respectively, or decarboxylated hydroxycinnamic acids into the corresponding vinyl derivatives and then reduced the latter compounds to ethyl compounds. reductase activities mainly emerged, and the activities of selected strains were  further investigated in chemically defined basal medium (cdm) under anaerobic conditions. the end products of carbon metabolism were quantified, as were the levels of intracellular atp and the nad(+)/nadh ratio. electron and carbon balances and theoretical atp/glucose yields were also estimated. when cdm was supplemented with hydroxycinnamic acids, the synthesis of ethanol decreased and the concentration of acetic acid increased. the levels of these metabolites reflected on the alcohol dehydrogenase and acetate kinase activities. overall, some biochemical traits distinguished the common metabolism of strictly heterofermentative strains: main reductase activity toward hydroxycinnamic acids, a shift from alcohol dehydrogenase to acetate kinase activities, an increase in the nad(+)/nadh ratio, and the accumulation of supplementary intracellular atp. taken together, the above-described metabolic responses suggest that strictly heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria mainly use hydroxycinnamic acids as external acceptors of electrons.

TI  == inhibitors of biofilm formation by biofuel fermentation contaminants.
AB  == biofuel fermentation contaminants such as lactobacillus sp. may persist in production facilities by forming recalcitrant biofilms. in this study, biofilm-forming strains of lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus plantarum were isolated and characterized from a dry-grind fuel ethanol plant. a variety of potential biofilm inhibitors were tested, including microbial polysaccharides, commercial enzymes, ferric ammonium citrate, liamocins, phage endolysin, xylitol, and culture supernatants from bacillus sp. a commercial enzyme mixture (novozyme 188) and culture supernatants from bacillus subtilis strains alt3a and rpt-82412 were identified as the most promising biofilm inhibitors. in biofilm flow cells, these inhibitors reduced the density of viable biofilm cells by 0.8-0.9 log cfu/cm(2). unlike b. subtilis strain rpt-82412, b. subtilis strain alt3a and novozyme 188 did not inhibit planktonic growth of lactobacillus sp. maldi-tof mass spectra showed the production of surfactin-like molecules by both b. subtilis strains, and the coproduction of iturin-like molecules by strain rpt-82412.

TI  == use of sourdough fermentation and mixture of wheat, chickpea, lentil and bean flours for enhancing the nutritional, texture and sensory characteristics of white bread.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the addition of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours to wheat flour bread. type i sourdough containing legumes or wheat-legume flours were prepared and propagated (back slopped) in laboratory, according to traditional protocols that are routinely used for making typical italian breads. based on kinetic of acidification and culture-dependent data, the wheat-legume sourdough was further characterized and selected for bread making. as determined by rapd-pcr and partial sequencing of 16s rdna gene analyses, lactic acid bacteria in wheat-legume sourdough included lactobacillus plantarum,  lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus coryneformis, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus paraplantarum. two breads containing 15% (w/w) of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours were produced using selected wheat-legume sourdough (wlsb) and traditional wheat sourdough (wsb). compared to wheat yeasted bread (wyb), the level of total free amino acids (faa) was higher in wsb and wlsb. phytase and antioxidant activities were the highest in wlsb. compared to bread wyb, the addition of legume flours decreased the in vitro protein digestibility (ivpd) (wyb versus wsb). however, the dough fermentation with wslb favored an increase of ivpd. according to the levels of carbohydrates, dietary fibers and resistant starch, wsb and wlsb showed lower values of hydrolysis index (hi) compared to wyb. as showed by texture and image analyses and sensory evaluation of breads, a good acceptability was found for wsb and, especially, wlsb breads.

TI  == molecular identification of lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  == puba or carima is a brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. a total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de man, rogosa and sharpe agar (mrs); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. in all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 cfu/g). 16s-23s rrna ardra pattern assigned 116 isolates to the lactobacillus genus, represented by the species lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). reca gene-multiplex pcr analysis revealed that l. plantarum group isolates belonged to lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based pcr using the primer eric2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). the lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. all the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. this antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. this study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of lactobacillus spp. of puba.

TI  == strain-specific probiotics properties of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis isolates from brazilian food products.
AB  == a total of 234 lab isolates from brazilian food products were initially screened  for their ability to survive at ph 2.0. fifty one of the isolates survived and were selected. they were characterized by phenotypic methods, rep-pcr and identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus fermentum (34 isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (10) and lactobacillus brevis (7). based on being either highly tolerant to bile, showing an ability for auto-aggregation and/or hydrophobic properties, one l. fermentum (ch58), three l. plantarum (ch3,  ch41 and sau96) and two l. brevis (sau105 and ffc199) were selected. the highest  co-aggregation ability with escherichia coli was observed to l. plantarum ch41. l. brevis sau105 and ffc199 and l. fermentum ch58 exhibited antagonistic activity towards the pathogens listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 and l. brevis ffc199 showed adhesion ability to caco-2 cells (1.6, 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively) similar to the commercial probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (1.5%). they were able to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) of caco-2 cells over 24 h (p < 0.05). the present work showed that the probiotic characteristics were strain-specific and that the  isolates l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 (cocoa) and l. brevis ffc199 (cauim) exhibited potential probiotics properties.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == a description of the lactic acid bacteria microbiota associated with the production of traditional fermented vegetables in vietnam.
AB  == an important part of the daily nourishment in vietnam constitutes of fermented vegetables. bacteria and especially lactic acid bacteria play a central role in the production of many fermented vegetables. the current study was conducted to investigate the diversity of native lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations in 'dua muoi' (mustard and beet fermentation) and 'ca muoi' (eggplant fermentation), three types of popular traditional fermented vegetables of vietnamese origin. to  this end a polyphasic approach combining matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and phes gene sequence analysis was used. in addition, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed as a culture-independent method to complement the observed culturable diversity data. a total of 881 lab isolates were recovered from 21 different samples. predominant lab associated with 'dua muoi' and 'ca muoi' were identified as lactobacillus fermentum (56.6%), lactobacillus pentosus  (24.4%) and lactobacillus plantarum (17.1%). less abundant species were pediococcus pentosaceus (1.0%) and lactobacillus brevis (0.5%). species present less than 0.1% included lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus pantheris and pediococcus acidilactici. in contrast to fermented mustard and beet with the highest prevalence of l. fermentum, the species most recovered from fermented eggplant samples was l. pentosus. in addition, an important degree of genetic variability within the different predominant species was observed and strain dependency correlating with the type of fermented vegetable or location of production could be demonstrated using multivariate statistics. this research gives an extensive and detailed inventory of the lab diversity associated with the production of diverse vietnamese fermented vegetables and demonstrates the influence of type of raw material and/or production location and conditions on this diversity.

TI  == alleviating effects of lactobacillus strains on pathogenic vibrio parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fluid accumulation in the mouse model.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic effects of lactobacillus strains against vibrio parahaemolyticus causing gastroenteritis. six-week-old icr mice were pretreated with four lactobacillus strains at three dosages, and then challenged with v. parahaemolyticus tgqx01 (serotype o3:k6). the results showed that v. parahaemolyticus tgqx01 caused severe intestinal fluid accumulation (fa)  and villi damage in control mice which were pretreated with phosphate-buffered saline. in contrast, significant alleviation of fa was seen in mice pretreated by with a high dose of lactobacillus strains (p < 0.05, n = 6) but not in mice that  received low-dose pretreatments. among middle-dose treatments, two highly adhesive strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus h15 and lactobacillus brevis y29-4, significantly decreased intestinal fa and villi damage in treated mice (p < 0.05). two low-adhesive strains, lactobacillus acidophilus y14-3 and lactobacillus fermentum f16-6, had no significant alleviating effects. at the same dosing levels, no significant differences in fa were observed in mice pretreated with strains with similar adhesive abilities but different antagonistic activities. our findings suggest that lactobacillus strains can alleviate v. parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fa in mice, and the doses required for in vivo efficacy depend more on adhesive ability than on the antibacterial activity of strains.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == an in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  == a method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. the novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic lactobacillus strains. only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. the application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic lactobacillus strains  belonging to lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus vaginalis species. even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up  makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == randomly-amplified microsatellite polymorphism for preliminary typing of lactic acid bacteria from bryndza cheese.
AB  == a high-throughput, medium-discrimination method for preliminary typing and selecting non-identical isolates of lactic acid bacteria in cheeses was developed. ramp, a pcr with one microsatellite-targeted and one random primer, was used for preliminary typing of 1119 isolates of lactic acid bacteria from slovak bryndza cheese. a total of 59 genotypes were identified based on ramp profiles consisting of 12-23 dna fragments of 150-3000 bp. for example, 18, 17, 13 and 7 different ramp-types were identified in lactobacillus brevis, l. plantarum, l. paracasei and l. fermentum, respectively. the method facilitated well reproducible, medium-discrimination typing of lactobacillus spp. and pediococcus spp. at a subspecies level and proved to be suitable for preliminary  typing of lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheese.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == effects of ensilage on storage and enzymatic degradability of sugar beet pulp.
AB  == ensiling was investigated for the long-term storage of sugar beet pulp (sbp). eight strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and a non-inoculated control were screened based on their ability to rapidly reduce ph, produce a large amount of lactic acid and inhibit undesirable fermentations. lactobacillus brevis b-1836 (lab #120), lactobacillus fermentum nrrl b-4524 (lab #137) and a non-inoculated control were selected for further research to determine the effects of lab inoculation level and packing density on sbp silage quality and sugar yield upon  enzymatic hydrolysis. both sbp preservation and prevention of cellulose and hemicellulose loss were better when sbp was treated with lab #137 compared to lab #120 and the non-inoculated control. additionally, the ensiling process was found to significantly improve the enzymatic digestibility of sbp by as much as 35%. the results suggest that ensiling may be a promising technology for sbp stabilization and pretreatment for bioconversion to products.

TI  == glycemic index and phenolics of partially-baked frozen bread with sourdough.
AB  == different lactic acid bacteria starters were used to prepare sourdough to make partially-baked frozen wholemeal wheat bread. the sourdough was prepared with a pure culture of lactobacillus plantarum or with commercial starters containing lactobacillus brevis combined with saccharomyces cerevisiae var. chevalieri (lv4), lactobacillus fermentum (pl1), or lactobacillus fermentum with phytase (pl3). we determined the acetic and lactic acid concentrations in sourdough, bread chemical composition, total phenolics content and glycemic index (gi) in vivo. depending on the starter, the lactic to acetic acid ratio in the sourdough  was significantly different. the gi of control bread without sourdough (70) was significantly higher than that of bread containing sourdough prepared with lv4 starter (50), pl1 starter (56) or pl3 starter (56), but not from bread with l. plantarum sourdough (60). the addition of 10% sourdough with a lower molar ratio  of lactic to acetic acid ( </= 4) and higher total phenolics content is preferable for generating bread with medium and low gi.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of phenolic acids against commensal, probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. as an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml, whereas pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. the genetically manipulated e. coli lpxc/tolc strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. the growth of lactobacilli (lactobacillus paraplantarum lch7, lactobacillus plantarum lch17, lactobacillus fermentum lph1, l. fermentum cect 5716, lactobacillus brevis lch23, and lactobacillus coryniformis cect 5711) and pathogens (s. aureus ep167 and c. albicans my1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. only p. aeruginosa pao1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. the antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.

TI  == determination of dynamic characteristics of microbiota in a fermented beverage produced by brazilian amerindians using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == cauim is a fermented beverages prepared by tapirape amerindians in brazil from substrates such as cassava, rice, peanuts, pumpkin, cotton seed and maize. here we study the microorganisms associated with peanut and rice fermentation using a  combination of culture-dependent and -independent methods. the bacterial population varied from 7.4 to 8.4 log cfu/ml. the yeast population varied from 4.0 to 6.6 log cfu/ml. a total of 297 bacteria and yeasts strains were isolated during fermentation, with 198 bacteria and 99 yeast. the lactobacillus genus was  dominant throughout fermentation. bacteria and yeast community dynamics during the fermentation process were monitored by pcr-dgge analysis. both culture-dependent and -independent methods indicated that the bacterial species l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. paracasei and l. brevis as well as the yeast species p. guilliermondii, k. lactis, candida sp, r. toruloides and saccharomyces cerevisiae, were dominant during fermentation. multivariate analysis of microorganisms during beverage fermentation showed that the microbial community changed during the fermentation process.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == characterization of a cryptic plasmid pd403 from lactobacillus plantarum and construction of shuttle vectors based on its replicon.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid pd403 was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum d403 derived from fermented dairy products. it was 2,791 bp in size with a g+c content of 37%. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. orf1 (318 amino acids) was identified as a replication protein (repa). orf2 (137  amino acids) shared 31% similarity with the transcriptional regulator of ralstonia pickettii 12d. functional investigation indicated that orf2 (tra) had the ability of improving the transformation efficiency. the origin of replication was predicted, suggesting that pd403 was a rolling-circle-replication (rcr) plasmid. an escherichia coli/lactobacillus shuttle vector pcd4032 was constructed based on the pd403 replicon, and proved to be successfully transformed into various lactobacilli including lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus brevis. the transformation efficiencies were ranged from 1.3 x 10(2) to 7 x 10(4) transformants per microgram dna. furthermore, an expression vector pcd4033 was developed with the promoter of the lactate dehydrogenase from lactobacillus delbrueckii 11842. the green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a reporter was expressed successfully in various lactobacilli tested, suggesting that the expression vector pcd4033 had the potential to be used as a molecular tool for heterologous gene cloning and expression in lactobacilli.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular identification of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal secretions.
AB  == background and purpose: twenty lactobacilli isolated from vaginal samples of healthy volunteers were characterized according to polyphasic taxonomy. a broad spectrum of activity and protective properties of these vaginal isolates has been reported. methods: phenotypic and genotypic methods such as random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd), species-specific and box polymerase chain reaction (pcr), amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), and 16s rrna sequence analyses were applied for lactobacillus spp. identification. results: on the basis of carbohydrate utilization profiles using api 50 chl kits (fermentation pattern), the strains were divided into 7 groups. rapd- and box-pcr analyses revealed heterogeneity within the established phenotypic groups and discriminated successfully between the vaginal strains. the combination of species-specific pcr, ardra, and 16s rrna sequence analyses allowed the species identification of  7 strains as lactobacillus fermentum, 2 as lactobacillus gasseri, 1 as lactobacillus brevis, and 1 as lactobacillus salivarius. these results were not in agreement with data obtained by classical and molecular methods for some clinical isolates. conclusion: this is the first polyphasic taxonomy study on vaginal lactobacilli from bulgarian women of reproductive age. these data add to  the limited information existing in bulgaria on the true identity of lactobacillus spp. in the vaginal microbiota.

AB  == the effects of 3 different methods for removing the initial air on the properties of fermented plant beverages produced from phom-nang seaweed (gracilaria fisheri) and wild forest noni (morinda coreia ham.) were investigated. only method m which covered the space above the fermentation liquid with a water filled plastic bag produced no surface film of yeast, had the highest acidity and also antibacterial activity from both plants after 90 days of fermentation. however, the yeast count still exceeded the standard guidelines for plant beverages. the fermented beverage from wild forest noni showed more antibacterial activity against 3 of 4  pathogenic bacteria tested than that from the phomnang seaweed, probably for its  higher levels of acidity and ethanol content. lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the fermentation samples from days 1-5 using the method m from both fermented plant beverages were leuconostoc mesenteroides supsp. mesenteroides and leu. mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum while presence of lactobacilus plantarum was only recorded at days 4-5 in the wild forest noni beverage. from days 6-14 the isolates were lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus brevis from wild forest noni beverage, whereas only l. brevis was not detected in the seaweed beverage. during days 21-45 both beverages had a similar lab population of l. plantarum and l. brevis while l. coryniformis was only found in the wild forest noni beverage. between days 60-90 in both plant beverages only l. plantarum and lactobacillius sp. were detected.

TI  == a strategy to prevent the occurrence of lactobacillus strains using lactate-tolerant yeast candida glabrata in bioethanol production.
AB  == contamination of lactobacillus sp. in the fermentation broth of bioethanol production decreases ethanol production efficiency. although the addition of lactate to the broth can effectively inhibit the growth of lactobacillus sp., it  also greatly reduces the fermentation ability of saccharomyces cerevisiae. to overcome this conflict, lactate-tolerant yeast strains were screened. candida glabrata strain nfri 3164 was found to exhibit both higher levels of lactate tolerance and fermentation ability. co-cultivation of c. glabrata was performed with lactobacillus brevis and lb. fermentum, which were reported as major contaminating bacteria during bioethanol production, in culture medium containing 2% lactate. under these culture conditions, the growth of lactobacillus strains was greatly inhibited, but the ethanol production of c. glabrata was not significantly affected. our data show the possibility of designing an effective fuel ethanol production process that eliminates contamination by lactobacillus strains through the combined use of lactate addition and c. glabrata.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == rapid detection and quantification of tyrosine decarboxylase gene (tdc) and its expression in gram-positive bacteria associated with fermented foods using pcr-based methods.
AB  == in this study, pcr-based procedures were developed to detect the occurrence and quantify the expression of the tyrosine decarboxylase gene (tdc) in gram-positive bacteria associated with fermented foods. consensus primers were used in conventional and reverse transcription pcr to analyze a collection of 87 pure cultures of lactic acid bacteria and staphylococci. all enterococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, and lactobacillus fermentum strains and 1 of 10 staphylococcus xylosus strains produced amplification products with the primers dec5 and dec3 in accordance with results of the screening plate method and with previously reported result obtained with high-performance liquid chromatography. no amplicons were obtained  for tyramine-negative strains, confirming the high specificity of these new primers. a novel quantitative real-time pcr assay was successfully applied to quantify tdc and its transcript in pure cultures and in meat and meat products. this assay allowed estimation of the influence of different variables (ph, temperature, and nacl concentration) on the tdc expression of the tyraminogenic strain enterococcus faecalis ef37 after 72 h of growth in m17 medium. data obtained suggest that stressful conditions could induce greater tyrosine decarboxylase activity. the culture-independent pcr procedures developed here may be used for reliable and fast detection and quantification of bacterial tyraminogenic activity without the limitations of conventional techniques.

TI  == diversity of predominant lactic acid bacteria associated with cocoa fermentation  in nigeria.
AB  == the fermentation of cocoa relies on a complex succession of bacteria and filamentous fungi, all of which can have an impact on cocoa flavor. so far, few investigations have focused on the diversity of lactic acid bacteria involved in  cocoa fermentation, and many earlier investigations did not rely on polyphasic taxonomical approaches, which take both phenotypic and genotypic characterization techniques into account. in our study, we characterized predominant lactic acid bacteria from cocoa fermentations in nigeria, using a combination of phenotypic tests, repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr, and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene of representative strains for accurate species identification. thus, of a total of 193 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains isolated from common media used to cultivate lab, 40 (20.7%) were heterofermentative and consisted of either l. brevis or l. fermentum strains. the majority of the isolates were homofermentative rods (110 strains; 57% of isolates) which were characterized as  l. plantarum strains. the homofermentative cocci consisted predominantly of 35 (18.1% of isolates) pediococcus acidilactici strains. thus, the lab populations derived from these media in this study were accurately described. this can contribute to the further assessment of the effect of common lab strains on the flavor characteristics of fermenting cocoa in further studies.

TI  == population dynamics and metabolite target analysis of lactic acid bacteria during laboratory fermentations of wheat and spelt sourdoughs.
AB  == four laboratory sourdough fermentations, initiated with wheat or spelt flour and  without the addition of a starter culture, were prepared over a period of 10 days with daily back-slopping. samples taken at all refreshment steps were used for determination of the present microbiota. furthermore, an extensive metabolite target analysis of more than 100 different compounds was performed through a combination of various chromatographic methods including liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. the establishment of a stable microbial ecosystem occurred through a three-phase evolution within a week, as revealed by both microbiological and metabolite analyses. strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus paraplantarum were dominating some of the sourdough ecosystems. although the heterofermentative l. fermentum was dominating one of the wheat sourdoughs, all other sourdoughs were dominated by a combination of obligate and facultative heterofermentative taxa. strains of homofermentative species were not retrieved in the stable sourdough ecosystems. concentrations of sugar and amino acid metabolites hardly changed during the last days of fermentation. besides lactic acid, ethanol, and mannitol, the production of succinic acid, erythritol, and various amino acid metabolites,  such as phenyllactic acid, hydroxyphenyllactic acid, and indolelactic acid, was shown during fermentation. physiologically, they contributed to the equilibration of the redox balance. the biphasic approach of the present study allowed us to map some of the interactions taking place during sourdough fermentation and helped us to understand the fine-tuned metabolism of lactic acid bacteria, which  allows them to dominate a food ecosystem.

TI  == characterization of lactobacilli isolated from caper berry fermentations.
AB  == aims: to determine the metabolic and functional properties of lactobacilli isolated from caper fermentation. methods and results: a collection of 58 lactobacilli from fermentation of caper berries (including species of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus fermentum) was studied. strains were classified in different clusters according to sugar fermentation patterns. most strains of l. plantarum (the predominant species in the fermentation) clustered in a single group. analysis of enzymatic activities revealed a high incidence of  leucine aminopeptidase, acid phosphatase, beta-galactosidase and beta-glucosidase among the different strains of lactobacilli. a high number of strains were able to degrade raffinose and stachyose. phytase activity and bile salt hydrolase activity were only detected in certain strains of l. plantarum. conclusions: lactobacilli from caper fermentation are metabolically diverse, and some strains  display functional properties of interest. significance and impact of the study:  strains of lactobacilli with selected functional properties could be good candidates for future development of commercial starters for industrial caper fermentation.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == genetic diversity, dynamics, and activity of lactobacillus community involved in  traditional processing of artisanal manchego cheese.
AB  == a total of 248 strains of predominant lactobacilli isolated during the manufacture and ripening of artisanal manchego cheeses obtained from two dairies  were obtained and the genetic diversity of 197 investigated using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd-pcr). 51 isolates could not be lysed and were therefore not genotyped. forty-two distinct rapd patterns, grouped in six major clusters at a similarity level of 54%, were obtained. phenotypic characterization of isolates enabled their assignment to the species l. plantarum, l. brevis, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. pentosus, l. acidophilus and l. curvatus. in samples from both dairies, the species l. plantarum, l. brevis and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei dominated during ripening. three genotypes showed excellent physiological characteristics and were therefore proposed as adjunct cultures for manchego cheese manufacture.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  == background: lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producers. nonoxynol-9 (n-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. it immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. it is known that n-9 inhibits lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. purpose: the present study was conducted to identify the species of lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the h(2)o(2)-producing and n-9-resistant strains in an argentine population. results: we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, l. casei subsp. casei, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. in this argentine, south american population, 62% of women had h(2)o(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. we found a high number of sensitive  strains. sixty-two h(2)o(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to n-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of n-9. discussion: the vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among argentine women as in other countries,  and (2) n-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

AB  == a collection of lactobacilli comprising species of lactobacillus plantarum (43 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates) and lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates) obtained from spontaneous fermentations of capers (the fruits of capparis spinosa) were investigated for resistance to antimicrobial agents. all isolates were resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin (mic > 16 microg/ml). resistance to ciprofloxacin (mic > 2 microg/ml) was detected in all isolates of l. brevis and l. fermentum as well as in most isolates of l. plantarum, whilst resistance to levofloxacin showed a much lower incidence. among l. plantarum and  l. brevis isolates, low levels of resistance to tetracycline and/or nitrofurantoin were detected. higher resistance levels were also detected in some isolates. resistance to penicillin and rifampicin were also detected among l. plantarum isolates. all isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == [antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  == objective: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. design: review of literature. setting: charles university at prague, pharmaceutical faculty at hradec kralove. methods: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. conclusions: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. the efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of c. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. essential oils present in the cayenne pepper (capsodum  frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against c. albicans as well. clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. the effects of chinese leek are similar to garlic. propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the  yeast strains decreases in the following order: c. albicans > c. tropicalis > c.  crusei > c. guilliermondii. its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. tea trea oil (melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for c. crusei and c. norvengensis. in the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of lactobacilus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, b-54 may be recommended. moreover there are suitable strains  of l. brevis cd-2, l. salivarius fv-2, l. gasseri mb 335, l. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (l. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (l. gasseri). the strains of l. acidophilus crl 1294 and l. salivarius crl 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with candida. it should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of lactobacillus (especially l. casei and l. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract.  no protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin e, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and yeasts associated with spontaneous fermentations during  the production of sour cassava starch in brazil.
AB  == sour cassava starch is a traditional fermented food used in the preparation of fried foods and baked goods such as traditional cheese breads in brazil. thirty samples of sour cassava starch were collected from two factories in the state of  minas gerais. the samples were examined for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, mesophilic microorganisms, bacillus cereus and faecal coliforms. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolates were identified by biochemical tests, and the identities were confirmed by molecular methods. lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum were the prevalent lactic acid bacteria in product from both factories, at numbers between 6.0 and 9.0 log cfu g(-)(1). lactobacillus perolans and lactobacillus brevis were minor fractions of the population. galactomyces geothricum and issatchenkia sp. were the prevalent yeasts at numbers of 5.0 log cfu g(-)(1). a species similar to candida ethanolica was frequently isolated from one factory. mesophilic bacteria and amylolytic microorganisms were recovered in high numbers at all stages of the fermentation. b. cereus was found  at low numbers in product at both factories. the spontaneous fermentations associated with the production of sour cassava starch involve a few species of lactic acid bacteria at high numbers and a variety of yeasts at relatively low numbers.

TI  == diversity and technological properties of predominant lactic acid bacteria from fermented cassava used for the preparation of gari, a traditional african food.
AB  == traditional fermentation of cassava is dominated by a lactic acid bacteria (lab)  population. fermentation is important for improving product flavour and aroma as  well as safety, especially by reduction of its toxic cyanogenic glucosides. the production of gari from cassava in benin typically occurs on a household or small industrial scale, and consequently suffers from inconsistent product quality and  may not always be safe for consumption. therefore, the diversity of lab from a typical cassava fermentation for the preparation of gari, and their technologically relevant characteristics were investigated with a view towards selection of appropriate starter cultures. a total of 139 predominant strains isolated from fermenting cassava were identified using phenotypic tests and genotypic methods such as rep-pcr and rapd-pcr. dna-dna hybridisation and sequencing of the 16s rrna genes were done for selected strains. lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundantly isolated species (54.6% of isolates), followed  by leuconostoc fallax (22.3%) and lactobacillus fermentum (18.0%). lactobacillus  brevis, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides and weissella paramesenteroides were sporadically isolated. the l. plantarum strains were shown to be better acid producers and capable of faster acid production than the l. fallax or l. fermentum strains. the incidence of beta-glucosidase (linamarase) activity was also highest among strains of this species. production of antagonistic substances such as h2o2 and bacteriocins, however, was more common among l. fallax and l. fermentum strains. strains of all three species were capable of utilising the indigestible sugars raffinose and stachyose. therefore, a starter culture containing a mixture of strains from all three species was recommended.

TI  == plasmid profiling and curing of lactobacillus strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of chicken.
AB  == in this study, we assessed the susceptibility of 12 lactobacillus strains, all of which had been isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of chicken, to three antibiotics (chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline) used commonly as selective markers in transformation studies of lactic acid bacteria. among these  strains, 17%, 58%, and 25% were found to exhibit a high degree of resistance to 200 microg/ml of tetracycline, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol, respectively. seven of the 12 lactobacillus strains exhibiting resistance to at least 50 microg/ml of chloramphenicol or erythromycin, and five strains exhibiting resistance to at least 50 microg/ml of tetracycline, were subsequently subjected  to plasmid curing with chemical curing agents, such as novobiocin, acriflavin, sds, and ethidium bromide. in no cases did the antibiotic resistance of these strains prove to be curable, with the exception of the erythromycin resistance exhibited by five lactobacillus strains (l. acidophilus i16 and i26, l. fermentum i24 and c17, and l. brevis c10). analysis of the plasmid profiles of these five cured derivatives revealed that all of the derivatives, except for l. acidophilus i16, possessed profiles similar to those of wild-type strains. the curing of l. acidophilus i16 was accompanied by the loss of 4.4 kb, 6.1 kb, and 11.5 kb plasmids.

AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == antimicrobial interactions of microbial species involved in the fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima with particular reference to the inhibitory effect of lactic acid bacteria on enteric pathogens.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria, bacillus species and yeasts are involved in the fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima. microbial interactions within and between these groups of microorganisms were investigated in addition to the survival of five enteric pathogens inoculated into agbelima under various conditions. nine out of 10 cultures of lactic acid bacteria isolated at the end of agbelima fermentation showed inhibitory effect against 10 cultures of lactic acid bacteria isolated at the start of fermentation. only 3 out of 10 isolates of bacillus subtilis were inhibited by 10 isolates of lactic acid bacteria tested. no interactions were observed between yeasts and the lactic acid bacteria, whereas three of the bacillus isolates showed inhibitory effects against the yeasts. twelve isolates of lactobacillus plantarum tested inhibited the growth of an isolate each of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus brevis but none tested positive for bacteriocin production. the antimicrobial effect of the lactic acid bacteria was attributed to acid production. in fermenting cassava dough, enteric pathogens survived to different extents depending on ph and their  sensitivity to acids. vibrio cholerae c-230, salmonella typhimurium 9 and salmonella enteritidis 226 were not detectable in 10 g of sample after 4 h when inoculated into the 48-h fermented product, agbelima, whereas shigella dysenteriae 2357t and escherichia coli d2188 were detectable up to 8 h in the product.

TI  == the potential of dairy lactic acid bacteria to metabolise amino acids via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination.
AB  == the metabolism of amino acids by 22 starter and 49 non-starter lactic acid bacteria (lab) was studied in a system consisting of amino acids and non-growing  cells without added amino acceptors such as alpha-ketoglutarate. there were significant inter- and intra-species differences in the metabolism of amino acids. some amino acids such as alanine, arginine, aspartate, serine and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) were utilised, whereas other amino acids such as glycine, ornithine and citrulline were produced. alanine and aspartate were utilised by some lab and accumulated during  the incubation of other lab. arginine was degraded not only by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (the lactococcal subspecies known to catabolise arginine), but also by pediococci, heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus brevis and lb. fermentum) and some unidentified homofermentative lactobacilli. serine was utilised predominantly by homofermentative lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. rhamnosus and lb. plantarum. of the lab studied, lb. brevis and lb. fermentum were the most metabolically active, utilising alanine, arginine, aspartate, glutamate and branched-chain amino acids. leuconostocs were the least metabolically active, showing little potential to metabolise amino acids. the formation of ammonia and acetate from amino acid metabolism varied both between species and between strains within species. these findings suggest that the potential of lab for amino acid metabolism via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination will impact both on the physiology of lab and on cheese ripening, especially when transamination is rate-limiting in the absence of an exogenous amino acceptor such as alpha-ketoglutarate.

AB  == proteolytic activities were investigated in sorghum-based togwa prepared by natural fermentation and using starter cultures previously isolated from the native product, i.e., lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, and issatchenkia orientalis in coculture with either l. brevis or l. plantarum. both  proteinase and aminopeptidase activities were substantially higher in naturally fermented togwa than in those with starters (14-30%, 12-70%, respectively). a variable but substantial part of the proteinase activity followed the particulate fraction of togwa; aminopeptidase activity was mainly in that fraction. the breakdown of relatively high molecular mass protein (64 kda) in togwa was detected by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page); the products were mainly in the 14-30 kda range. reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography (rp-fplc)-protein/peptide patterns changed during fermentation with some variation between togwa of different cultures. supplementation of gruel with malt increased the concentration of total protein [from 9.5% to 11.0% (w/w) on dry weight basis)] and of most of the free amino acids. fermentation had no effect on total protein content; however, the concentration of most of the amino acids was reduced, except for the proline content that increased. natural fermentation also increased the concentration of  glutamic acid and ornithine. fermentation by p. pentosaceus increased aspartic acid, while l. cellobiosus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis in coculture with i. orientalis increased the concentration of citrulline.

TI  == use of starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in the preparation of  togwa, a tanzanian fermented food.
AB  == starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus) and yeasts (candida pelliculosa, candida tropicalis, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyes cerevisiae) isolated from native togwa were tested singly or in combination for their ability to ferment maize-sorghum gruel to produce togwa. all species of bacteria showed an ability to ferment the gruel as  judged by lowering the ph from 5.87 to 3.24-3.49 and increasing the titratable acidity from 0.08% to 0.30-0.44% (w/w, lactic acid) in 24 h. yeasts used singly showed little activity within 12 h, but lowered the ph to 3.57-4.81 and increased the acidity to 0.11-0.21% in 24 h. yeasts in co-culture with lactic acid bacteria (lab) had a modest effect on the final acidity (p<0.05). the number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts increased while the enterobacteriaceae decreased with fermentation time. the ph was lowered and lactic acid produced significantly (p<0.05) fastest in natural togwa fermentation and in samples fermented by l. plantarum or l. plantarum in co-culture with i. orientalis. the content of fermentable sugars was reduced during fermentation. most volatile flavour compounds were produced in samples from fermentation by p. pentosaceus and i. orientalis in co-culture with either l. plantarum or l. brevis.

TI  == evidence for chromosomal determination of fungicidal activity in strains of lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus fermentum isolated from fermented foods.
AB  == the genetic basis of the fungicidal activity of strains of lactobacillus brevis and l. fermentum isolated from indigenous fermented foods was determined. a 5.5-kb plasmid was isolated from l. brevis while l. fermentum was found to harbor no plasmid. plasmid curing indicated no correlation between the plasmid and the fungicidal activity of the lactobacillus species. the fungicidal activity of the  isolated organisms can be supposed to be mediated by the chromosome. no antibiotic resistance genetic markers were detected on the plasmid and hence it was classified as cryptic.

TI  == isolation, selection, and characterization of lactic acid bacteria for a competitive exclusion product to reduce shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 in cattle.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected on the basis of characteristics indicating that they would be good candidates for a competitive exclusion product (cep) that would inhibit escherichia coli o157:h7 in the intestinal tract of live cattle. fecal samples from cattle that were culture negative for e. coli o157:h7  were collected. lab were isolated from cattle feces by repeated plating on deman  rogosa sharpe agar and lactobacillus selection agar. six hundred eighty-six pure  colonies were isolated, and an agar spot test was used to test each isolate for its inhibition of a four-strain mixture of e. coli o157:h7. three hundred fifty-five isolates (52%) showed significant inhibition. seventy-five isolates showing maximum inhibition were screened for acid and bile tolerance. most isolates were tolerant of acid at ph levels of 2, 4, 5, and 7 and at bile levels  of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3% (oxgall) and were subsequently identified with the api system. lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus delbreukii, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, leuconostoc spp., and pediococcus acidilactici were the most commonly identified lab. nineteen strains were further tested for antibiotic resistance and inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 in manure and rumen fluid. four of these 19 strains showed susceptibility to all of the antibiotics, 13 significantly reduced e. coli counts in manure, and 15 significantly reduced e. coli counts in rumen fluid (p < 0.05) during at least one of the sampling periods. one of the strains, m35, was selected as the best candidate for a cep. a 16s rrna sequence analysis of m35 revealed its close homology to lactobacillus crispatus. the cep developed will be used in cattle-feeding trials.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria from spontaneous fermentation of 'almagro' eggplants by sds-page whole cell protein fingerprinting.
AB  == in order to complete the previously performed phenotypic identification [sanchez  et al., 2000. int. j. food microbiol. 59 (2000) 9], whole cell protein patterns obtained using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of 149 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains, isolated from 'almagro' eggplants spontaneous fermentation, were analysed. phenotypic identification of those strains had revealed the presence of the species lactobacillus (lb) plantarum, lb. pentosus, lb. brevis biotype 2, lb. brevis biotype 3, lb. fermentum, lactobacillus spp. and aerococcus viridans. the sds-page technique generated complex and stable patterns that were easy to interpret and compare with those of the 17 reference strains used in this study. after numerical analysis of the resulting electrophoretic protein patterns, six well-delineated clusters were discriminated that, with some exceptions, correlated well with the  different groups phenotypically found. only two strains showed unique protein patterns without meaningful homology to any of the reference strains used for this study and remained unidentified.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == microbiological and fermentation characteristics of togwa, a tanzanian fermented  food.
AB  == selected microbiological and metabolic characteristics of sorghum, maize, millet  and maize-sorghum togwa were investigated during natural fermentation for 24 h. the process was predominated by lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts. the mesophiles, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts increased and the enterobacteriaceae decreased to undetectable levels within 24 h. the isolated microorganisms were tentatively identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus cellobiosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, weissella confusa, issatchenkia orientalis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida pelliculosa and candida tropicalis. the ph decreased from 5.24-5.52 to 3.10-3.34. maltose increased initially and then decreased, fructose decreased and glucose levels increased during the first 12 h of fermentation. the organic acids detected during fermentation included dl-lactic, succinic, formic, pyruvic, citric, pyroglutamic and uric acid. lactate was the predominant acid and increased significantly with time. the volatile organic compounds (voc) detected  included acetaldehyde, 2-methyl-propanal, 2-methyl-butanal, 3-methyl-butanal, ethanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, diacetyl and acetoin. ethanol was the predominant voc and it increased significantly with  time.

TI  == effect of freezing on the spontaneous fermentation and sensory attributes of almagro eggplants.
AB  == a study of the physico-chemical and microbiological processes taking place during the spontaneous fermentation of eggplant fruits that had been frozen after blanching revealed a delay in the onset of the active fermentation stage, which has been ascribed to the adverse effect of the freezing temperature employed on the lactic acid bacteria involved in fermentation. the species most affected by freezing were l. fermentum and l. brevis biotype 2. despite this finding, the pattern of fermentation was similar to the fermentation process in unfrozen eggplants. freezing of the fruits did not significantly affect the sensory acceptability of the product and, in fact, in some cases, almagro eggplants made  from frozen fruits were preferred to commercially manufactured products.

TI  == evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  == the development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partial 16s rrna genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to streptococcus thermophilus or saccharococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus fermentum. the middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus paracasei, l. fermentum, and lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by dgge during this stage. bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of  residual maltooligosaccharides. by 70 h, two new pcr bands were detected on dgge  gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. the bacteria were phylogenetically related to lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had  previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in japan. these were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as mrs. their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.

TI  == characterisation and differentiation of lactobacilli by lectin typing.
AB  == lactobacillus isolates from healthy estonian and swedish children were characterised by a lectin typing technique; 56 isolates from six species (l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri) were tested. the typing system was based on an agglutination assay with a panel of six commercially available lectins, which were chosen on the basis of their carbohydrate specificities. the isolates were also subjected to proteolytic degradation before lectin typing to decrease auto-agglutination of whole cells in the assay. the 56 isolates were divided into 15 different lectin types by their lectin agglutination patterns. proteolytic treatment reduced auto-agglutination for the majority of species, apart from l. acidophilus, which remained predominantly auto-agglutinating (eight of nine strains). the system produced stable and reproducible results under standardised culture conditions. lactobacilli are important bacteria for use as probiotics and this system may supplement current molecular typing techniques and may help in identification of  strains that could be useful in this role.

AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) were isolated from 12 italian ewe cheeses representing six different types of cheese, which in several cases were produced by different manufacturers. a total of 400 presumptive lactobacillus isolates were obtained, and 123 isolates and 10 type strains were subjected to phenotypic, genetic, and cell wall protein characterization analyses. phenotypically, the cheese isolates included 32% lactobacillus plantarum isolates, 15% l. brevis isolates, 12% l. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, 9%  l. curvatus isolates, 6% l. fermentum isolates, 6% l. casei subsp. casei isolates, 5% l. pentosus isolates, 3% l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum isolates, and 1% l. rhamnosus isolates. eleven percent of the isolates were not phenotypically identified. although a randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis based on three primers and clustering by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (upgma) was useful for partially differentiating the 10 type strains, it did not provide a species-specific dna band or a combination of bands which permitted complete separation of all the species considered. in contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cell wall protein profiles clustered by upgma were species specific and resolved the nslab. the only exceptions were isolates phenotypically identified as l. plantarum and l. pentosus or as l. casei subsp. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, which were grouped together. based on protein profiles, italian ewe cheeses frequently contained four different species and 3 to 16 strains. in general, the cheeses produced from raw ewe milk contained a larger number of more diverse strains than the cheeses produced from pasteurized  milk. the same cheese produced in different factories contained different species, as well as strains that belonged to the same species but grouped in different rapd clusters.

TI  == characterization of lactobacilli from scotch malt whisky distilleries and description of lactobacillus ferintoshensis sp. nov., a new species isolated from malt whisky fermentations.
AB  == sixty-four strains of lactobacillus were isolated from fermentation samples from  23 malt whisky distilleries located in the major whisky producing regions of scotland. the strains were assigned to 26 ribotype patterns. strains of some ribotype patterns were widely distributed and recovered from distilleries throughout scotland, while strains representing other ribotypes were particular to a specific region or even a certain distillery. repeated sampling of a single  distillery over a 12 month period showed that the range of bacteria present, as indicated by ribotyping, was stable, but was influenced by changes in malt supply and the period of closure for annual maintenance. partial 16s rdna sequence analysis of ribotype representatives revealed lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus pentosus as the major species present in the distilleries; however, four isolates could not be identified by this procedure. determination of the full 16s rdna gene sequence from one of these isolates (strain r7-84) revealed >98.5% similarity to lactobacillus buchneri and its phylogenetic neighbours. dna from two other strains showed greater than 70% hybridization to dna from r7-84 under non-stringent renaturation conditions and dna from strain r7-84 shared less than  65% hybridization with members of the l. buchneri group. it is proposed that these three strains should be placed in a new species for which the name lactobacillus ferintoshensis represented by the type strain r7-84(t) is suggested.

TI  == decarboxylation of substituted cinnamic acids by lactic acid bacteria isolated during malt whisky fermentation.
AB  == seven strains of lactobacillus isolated from malt whisky fermentations and representing lactobacillus brevis, l. crispatus, l. fermentum, l. hilgardii, l. paracasei, l. pentosus, and l. plantarum contained genes for hydroxycinnamic acid (p-coumaric acid) decarboxylase. with the exception of l. hilgardii, these bacteria decarboxylated p-coumaric acid and/or ferulic acid, with the production  of 4-vinylphenol and/or 4-vinylguaiacol, respectively, although the relative activities on the two substrates varied between strains. the addition of p-coumaric acid or ferulic acid to cultures of l. pentosus in mrs broth induced hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase mrna within 5 min, and the gene was also induced by the indigenous components of malt wort. in a simulated distillery fermentation, a mixed culture of l. crispatus and l. pentosus in the presence of  saccharomyces cerevisiae decarboxylated added p-coumaric acid more rapidly than the yeast alone but had little activity on added ferulic acid. moreover, we were  able to demonstrate the induction of hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase mrna under these conditions. however, in fermentations with no additional hydroxycinnamic acid, the bacteria lowered the final concentration of 4-vinylphenol in the fermented wort compared to the level seen in a pure-yeast fermentation. it seems likely that the combined activities of bacteria and yeast  decarboxylate p-coumaric acid and then reduce 4-vinylphenol to 4-ethylphenol more effectively than either microorganism alone in pure cultures. although we have shown that lactobacilli participate in the metabolism of phenolic compounds during malt whisky fermentations, the net result is a reduction in the concentrations of 4-vinylphenol and 4-vinylguaiacol prior to distillation.

TI  == [cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == the possibility of using the genera lactobacillus and lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. the prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mrna, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). to prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. high copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in l. plantarum and l. pentosus strains. several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from staphylococcus aureus  plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. the vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including l. casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. but the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. l. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. in addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous  genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.

TI  == strain-dependent induction of cytokine profiles in the gut by orally administered lactobacillus strains.
AB  == different lactobacillus strains are frequently used in consumer food products. in addition, recombinant lactobacilli which contain novel expression vectors can now be used in immunotherapeutic applications such as oral vaccination strategies and in t cell tolerance induction approaches for autoimmune disease. both for food and clinical applications of lactobacilli, proper selection of wild type strains  is crucial. for that purpose, eight different common lactobacillus strains were analysed with respect to mucosal induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, iga-producing plasma cells in the gut, as well as systemic antibody responses against a parenterally administered antigen. immunohistochemical analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the gut villi showed no significant induction of the cytokines il-1alpha, ifn-gamma, il-4 or il-10 after oral administration of wild type lactobacillus strains. in contrast, oral administration of l. reuteri and l. brevis induced expression of the proinflammatory/th1 cytokines tnf-alpha, il-2 and/or il-1beta. oral administration of these two strains and l. fermentum also significantly enhanced  the igg response against parenterally administered haptenated chicken gamma globulin (tnp-cgg). the five other strains did not show this adjuvanticity. l. reuteri induced relatively high levels of igg2a compared to l. murines, a nonadjuving lactobacillus strain. these findings imply that different lactobacillus strains induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles and possess differential intrinsic adjuvanticity. this suggests that rational lactobacillus strain selection provides a strategy to influence cytokine expression and thereby influence immune responses.

AB  == sixty-five strains of obligately and facultatively heterofermentative sourdough lactic acid bacteria were screened for their capacity to grow optimally in the presence of arabinose, ribose and xylose as carbon sources. lactobacillus alimentarius 15f, lact. brevis 10a, lact. fermentum 1f and lact. plantarum 20b showed higher growth rate, cell yield, acidification rate and production of acetic acid when some pentoses instead of maltose were added to the sdb medium. lactobacillus plantarum 20b used arabinose also in a synthetic medium where complex growth factors such as yeast extract were omitted. other lact. plantarum  strains did not show the same property. pentosan extract was treated with alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase from aspergillus niger or endo-xylanase from bacillus subtilis to produce hydrolysates containing mainly arabinose and xylose, respectively. in particular, the hydrolysate containing arabinose substantiated the growth and the production of lactic acid and, especially, of acetic acid by lact. plantarum 20b. sourdough fermentation by lact. plantarum 20b with addition  of pentosan extract and alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase increased the acidification rate, titratable acidity and acetic acid content compared with traditional sourdough. a facultatively heterofermentative strain, lact. plantarum 20b, also produced a sourdough with an optimal fermentation quotient.

AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == microbial populations associated with the retting of melon pods (colocynthis citrullus l.) during seed recovery.
AB  == the traditional process for the retting of melon pulp and microbiological characteristics in the recovery of melon seeds (colocynthis citrullus l.) were investigated. melon pods were sliced open and exposed for seven days. the pulp underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/g. the ph fluctuated between 4.8 and 5.1 with  a lactic acid content of 0.72%. bacillus subtilis, b. polymyxa, lactobacillus fermentum, l. brevis and streptococcusfaecalis were the predominant microorganisms but, significant contributions were made by staphylococcus saprophyticus and enterobacter cloacae. penicillium, aspergillus and rhizopus species including the yeasts, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida krusei and deboromyces hansenii were isolated from the fermentation. growth of microorganisms was completely inhibited in antibiotic-treated samples indicating  that the melon pods were the main source of microorganisms for the fermentation.

TI  == lactobacilli counts in crop, ileum and caecum of growing broiler chickens fed on  practical diets containing whole or dehulled sweet lupin (lupinus angustifolius)  seed meal.
AB  == 1. four experiments with growing broiler chickens were carried out to study the effects of the inclusion in their diets of lupin (lupinus angustifolius) seed meal of e. coli and lactobacilli counts in crop, ileum and caecca at 3 or 4 weeks of age. 2. diets were formulated to contain the same amounts of metabolisable energy (12.55 mj/kg) and protein (210 g/kg). raw whole (heat-untreated) or dehulled sweet (low in alkaloids) lupin seed meal (400 and 320 g/kg respectively) were used to prepare the lupin-based diets, whose protein content was completed with either defatted soyabean meal or casein. 3. final body weight and food intake of chickens fed on whole lupin seed meal diets were lower than controls, but gain: food ratios were not different. however, birds given the diet with dehulled lupin seed meal had similar body weight, food intake and gain: food values as those of controls. 4. while e. coli counts were not affected, lactobacilli numbers were consistently increased compared to controls in all intestinal sections of chickens fed on the whole or dehulled lupin-based diets, irrespective of the age of the birds or the presence of soyabean meal or casein in the diet. the lactobacilli species isolated were: lactobacillus fermentum, l.  acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. brevis. 5. the results suggest that the use of  whole or dehulled sweet lupin seed meal in diets for growing broilers might enhance the growth of lactic acid--fermenting bacteria in the gut.

TI  == electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == influence of two infant formulas and human milk on the development of the faecal  flora in newborn infants.
AB  == the establishment of the faecal flora of 39 full-term infants fed exclusively on  breast milk (n = 20) or with two different modern adapted cow's milk formulas (n  = 19) was studied during the first 3 months of life. one formula investigated was based on 100% bovine casein as the protein source whereas the other formula contained bovine milk proteins with a whey/casein ratio of 60:40. a faecal flora  rich in bifidobacteria was found in all study groups; the growth of putrefactive  bacteria (especially bacteroides spp.), however, was limited. in formula-fed infants, significantly higher bacterial counts of enterococci and clostridia were detected compared to breast milk-fed infants. similarities and differences due to the feeding regimen were particularly reflected in the pattern of the anaerobic bacterial species. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis and b. breve constituted  the majority of the bifidobacterial flora independent of the type of milk feeding. other bifidobacterial species such as b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. parabifidum and b. pseudo-catenulatum were detected in high numbers and at low frequencies in breastfed infants. the latter three were observed in infants fed the whey/casein formula as well. it seems that infants fed a casein formula develop a faecal flora more like that of breastfed infants concerning lactobacillus spp. (especially l. fermentum and l. brevis).

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria from fermented maize (kenkey)  and their interactions during fermentation.
AB  == a total of 241 lactic acid bacteria belonging to lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus fermentum/reuteri and lactobacillus brevis from various processing stages of maize dough fermentation were investigated. results indicated that each processing stage has its own microenvironment with strong antimicrobial activity. about half of the lact. plantarum and practically  all of the lact. fermentum/reuteri investigated were shown to inhibit other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, explaining the elimination of these organisms during the initial processing stages. further, widespread microbial interactions amounting to 85% to 18% of all combinations tested were demonstrated amongst lactic acid bacteria within the various processing stages, i.e. raw material, steeping, 0 h and 48 h of fermentation, explaining the microbial succession taking place amongst lactic acid bacteria during fermentation. the antimicrobial effect was explained by the combined effect of acids, compounds sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and other compounds with antimicrobial activity  with the acid production being the most important factor. the pattern of antimicrobial factors was not species-specific and the safety and storage stability of fermented maize seem to depend on a mixed population of lactic acid  bacteria with different types of antimicrobial characteristics. this means that introduction of pure cultures as starters may impose a risk to the product.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli from sourdough and description of lactobacillus pontis sp. nov.
AB  == the microflora of sourdough preparations was investigated by examining the physiological characteristics, whole-cell protein patterns, and 16s rrna sequences of lactobacillus isolates. strains isolated from sourdough were placed  in the species lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus sanfrancisco, and lactobacillus reuteri. 16s rrna sequences were determined for l. brevis, lactobacillus fructivorans, lactobacillus fermentum, l. sanfrancisco, and l. reuteri, and oligonucleotide probes for fast specific identification of these sourdough lactobacilli were deduced. the physiological characteristics, protein patterns, and 16s rrna sequences of these organisms were compared with data for other sourdough lactobacilli and additional reference strains. strains of a lactobacillus species were isolated from rye sourdough; these strains may account for most of the flora in sourdough made from wheat or rye. these organisms were differentiated from other sourdough lactobacilli by their protein pattern, 16s rrna sequence, g + c content, and physiological properties. the 16s rrna sequence of this species was determined, and we constructed a phylogenetic tree which reflected the relationships of this species to other lactobacilli. this organism  is closely related to l. reuteri. a new lactobacillus species, lactobacillus pontis, is proposed. the type strain is l. pontis lth 2587 (= dsm 8475 = lmg 14187). we describe a general strategy in which a polyphasic approach was used to characterize a new species.

TI  == incompatibility of lactobacillus vectors with replicons derived from small cryptic lactobacillus plasmids and segregational instability of the introduced vectors.
AB  == three new lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. the shuttle vector plp3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from lactobacillus pentosus md353, an erythromycin resistance gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194, and puc19 as a replicon for escherichia coli. the vectors plpe317 and plpe323, which do not contain e. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pe194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from l. pentosus md353, respectively. these vectors and the shuttle vector plp825 (m. posno, r. j. leer, j. m. m. van rijn, b. c. lokman, and p. h. pouwels, p. 397-401, in a. t. ganesan and j. a. hoch, ed., genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into lactobacillus casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of dna. plasmid dna analysis of l. pentosus md353 transformants revealed that the introduction of plp3537 or plpe323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. remarkably, plpe317 could only be introduced into an l. pentosus md353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb  plasmid. the curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. however, plpe323 is stable in three of four lactobacillus strains tested so far.

TI  == the effect of ph on the sensitivity of species of lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, minocycline, and spiramycin, at a range of ph from 5.0 to 7.4. strains of streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. there were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. the strains tested were sensitive at ph 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/ml): l. casei (6 strains), 10-60; l. plantarum (4 strains), 40; l. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; l. brevis (1 strain), 10; and l. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. the streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/ml (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/ml (3 strains); and  10-20 micrograms/ml (2 strains). one strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/ml. chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower ph levels. the following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/ml) at ph 6.5 followed by sensitivity at ph 5.0: l. casei (atcc 15008), 40,60; l. plantarum (ch 374), 40,100; l. fermentum (ch 324) 10,40; l. acidophilus (atcc 4356), 10,40; and s. mutans (bm 52), 2,2. all of the strains of lactobacillus tested with spiramycin were resistant at ph 5.0. minocycline was less affected by changes in ph, but at ph 7.4 lactobacillus  strains were more resistant to minocycline as compared with spiramycin. both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. the lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.
