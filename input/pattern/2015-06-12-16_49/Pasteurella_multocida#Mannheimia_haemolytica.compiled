TI  - Emerging issues in antimicrobial resistance of bacteria from food-producing animals.
AB  - ABSTRACT During the last decade, antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food-producing animals has become a major research topic. In this review, different emerging resistance properties related to bacteria of food-producing animals are highlighted. These include: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae; carbapenemase-producing bacteria; bovine respiratory tract pathogens, such as Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica, which harbor the multiresistance mediating integrative and conjugative element ICEPmu1; Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that carry the multiresistance gene cfr; and the occurrence of numerous novel antimicrobial resistance genes in livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The emergence of the aforementioned resistance properties is mainly based on the exchange of mobile genetic elements that carry the respective resistance genes.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic integration and modelling of amoxicillin for the  calf pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of amoxicillin were determined for the bovine respiratory tract pathogens, Mannheima haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill curves were established. Pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling of the time-kill data, based on the sigmoidal Emax equation, generated parameters for three levels of efficacy, namely bacteriostatic, bactericidal (3log10 reduction) and 4log10 reduction in bacterial counts. For these levels, mean AUC(0-24 h) /MIC serum values for M. haemolytica were 29.1, 57.3 and 71.5 h, respectively, and corresponding values for P. multocida were 28.1, 44.9 and 59.5 h. Amoxicillin PK was determined in calf serum, inflamed (exudate) and noninflamed (transudate) tissue cage fluids, after intramuscular administration of a depot formulation at a dosage of 15 mg/kg. Mean residence times were 16.5 (serum), 29.6 (exudate) and 29.0 h (transudate). Based on serum MICs, integration of in vivo PK and in vitro PD data established maximum concentration (Cmax )/MIC ratios of 13.9:1 and 25.2:1, area under concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity )/MIC ratios of 179 and 325 h and T>MIC of 40.3 and 57.6 h for P. multocida and M. haemolytica, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations for a 90% target attainment rate predicted single dose to achieve bacteriostatic and bactericidal actions over 48 h of 17.7 and 28.3 mg/kg (M. haemolytica) and 17.7 and 34.9 mg/kg (P. multocida).
TI  - Respiratory pathogens in Quebec dairy calves and their relationship with clinical status, lung consolidation, and average daily gain.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is 1 of the 2 most important causes  of morbidity and mortality in dairy calves. Surprisingly, field data are scant concerning the prevalence of respiratory pathogens involved in BRD in preweaned dairy calves, especially in small herds. OBJECTIVES: To identify the main respiratory pathogens isolated from calves in Quebec dairy herds with a high incidence of BRD, and to determine if there is an association between the presence of these pathogens and clinical signs of pneumonia, lung consolidation, or average daily gain. ANIMALS: Cross-sectional study using a convenience sample of 95 preweaned dairy calves from 11 dairy herds. METHODS: At enrollment, calves were weighed, clinically examined, swabbed (nasal and nasopharyngeal), and lung ultrasonography was performed. One month later, all calves were reweighed. RESULTS: Twenty-two calves had clinical BRD and 49 had ultrasonographic evidence of lung consolidation. Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Histophilus somni were isolated in 54, 17, and 12 calves, respectively. Mycoplasma bovis was identified by PCR testing or culture in 19 calves, and 78 calves were found to be positive for Mycoplasma spp. Bovine coronavirus was detected in 38 calves and bovine respiratory syncytial virus in 1. Only the presence of M. bovis was associated with higher odds of clinical signs, lung consolidation, and lower average daily gain. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Results suggested that nasopharyngeal carriage of M. bovis was detrimental to health and growth of dairy calves in small herds with a high incidence of BRD.
TI  - Nasal isolation of Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida as predictors of respiratory disease in shipped calves.
AB  - Three hundred ninety five calves were purchased from sale barns and delivered to  the Willard Sparks Beef Research Center. Nasal swabs were collected to determine if presence of Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida in the upper respiratory tract (URT) can facilitate diagnosis of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Samples were collected at arrival and at treatment for BRD. Clinically healthy control calves were sampled at time of treatment of sick calves. M. haemolytica was more commonly isolated from calves at treatment than at time of arrival or from control calves. M. haemolytica was more common in calves requiring treatment than in those never treated. Need for treatment and number of treatments were negatively associated with average daily gain, supporting the accuracy of diagnosis. These results suggest that URT sampling, when combined with clinical diagnosis, may assist in providing greater diagnostic accuracy, improving ability to evaluate risk factors, interventions, and treatments.
TI  - Estimation of nasal shedding and seroprevalence of organisms known to be associated with bovine respiratory disease in Australian live export cattle.
AB  - The prevalence of organisms known to be associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) was investigated in cattle prior to export. A quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect nucleic acids from the following viruses and bacteria in nasal swab samples: Bovine coronavirus (BoCV; Betacoronavirus 1), Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), Bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida. Between 2010 and 2012, nasal swabs were collected from 1,484 apparently healthy cattle destined for export to the Middle East and Russian Federation. In addition, whole blood samples from 334 animals were tested for antibodies to BoHV-1, BRSV, BVDV-1, and BPIV-3 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The nasal prevalence of BoCV at the individual animal level was 40.1%. The nasal and seroprevalence of BoHV-1, BRSV, BVDV-1, and BPIV-3 was 1.0% and 39%, 1.2% and 46%, 3.0% and 56%, and 1.4% and 87%, respectively. The nasal prevalence of H. somni, M. bovis, M. haemolytica, and P. multocida was 42%, 4.8%, 13.4%, and 26%, respectively. Significant differences in nasal and seroprevalence were detected between groups of animals from different geographical locations. The results of the current study provide baseline data on the prevalence of organisms associated with BRD in Australian live export cattle in the preassembly period. This data could be used to develop strategies for BRD prevention and control prior to loading.
TI  - Comparison of pharmacokinetics of marbofloxacin after subcutaneous administration of various multiple-dose regimens to water buffalo calves (Bubalus bubalis).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine pharmacokinetics of marbofloxacin in water buffalo calves (Bubalus bubalis) after multiple SC administrations and to assess differences in regimen efficacy. ANIMALS: 18 healthy buffalo calves. PROCEDURES: Calves (n = 6 calves/group) were assigned to receive marbofloxacin SC in the neck at 1 of 3 dosages (2 mg/kg, q 24 h for 6 days [regimen 1]; 4 mg/kg, q 48 h for 6 days [regimen 2]; and 4 mg/kg, q 24 h for 3 days [regimen 3]). Serum marbofloxacin concentrations were analyzed. Efficacy predictors were estimated on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentration and mutant prevention concentration reported for Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD area under the concentration-time curve was 5.92 +/- 0.40 mug*h/mL for regimen 1, which differed significantly from that for regimens 2 (14.26 +/- 0.92 mug*h/mL) and 3 (14.17 +/- 0.51 mug*h/mL). Mean residence time and mean elimination half-life for regimen 2 (9.93 +/- 0.20 hours and 8.77 +/- 0.71 hours) both differed significantly from those for regimens 1 (721 +/- 0.11 hours and 5.71 +/- 0.38 hours) and 3 (759 +/- 0.13 hours and 737 +/- 1.19 hours). Values obtained from indices for P multocida and M haemolytica had an excessively wide range because of the various degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility (low, medium, and high) of the strains. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Regimen 3 had the most favorable indices, and it would be conducive for owner compliance and require less handling of animals.
TI  - Macrolide resistance conferred by rRNA mutations in field isolates of Mannheimia  haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine how resistance to macrolides is conferred in field isolates of Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica that lack previously identified resistance determinants for rRNA methylation, efflux and macrolide-modifying enzymes. METHODS: Isolates of P. multocida and M. haemolytica identified as being highly resistant (MICs >64 mg/L) to the macrolides erythromycin, gamithromycin, tilmicosin, tildipirosin and tulathromycin were screened by multiplex PCR for the previously identified resistance genes erm(42), msr(E) and mph(E). Strains lacking these determinants were analysed by genome sequencing and primer extension on the rRNAs. RESULTS: Macrolide resistance in one M. haemolytica isolate was conferred by the 23S rRNA mutation A2058G; resistance in three P. multocida isolates were caused by mutations at the neighbouring nucleotide A2059G. In each strain, all six copies of the rrn operons encoded the respective mutations. There were no mutations in the ribosomal protein genes rplD or rplV, and no other macrolide resistance mechanism was evident. CONCLUSIONS: High-level macrolide resistance can arise from 23S rRNA mutations in P. multocida and M. haemolytica despite their multiple copies of rrn. Selective pressures from exposure to different macrolide or lincosamide drugs presumably resulted in consolidation of either the A2058G or the A2059G mutation.
TI  - Growth of Mannheimia haemolytica: inhibitory agents and putative mechanism of inhibition.
AB  - Leukotoxin-producing Mannheimia haemolytica consistently causes fatal pneumonia in bighorn sheep (BHS) under experimental conditions. Surprisingly, by culture methods, it has been isolated from pneumonic BHS lungs less frequently than other bacteria. However, in one study PCR assays detected M. haemolytica from over 70% of the pneumonic lung samples that were negative for this organism by culture, suggesting that the growth of M. haemolytica is inhibited by other bacteria. Previously, we have shown that Bibersteinia trehalosi inhibits the growth of M. haemolytica. Herein we report that 100% of a diverse panel of B. trehalosi isolates (n=55) tested in a bacterial competition assay inhibited the growth of M. haemolytica, suggesting that the inhibitory phenotype is conserved. Further, no plasmids were isolated from any of the 30 B. trehalosi isolates tested, suggesting that the effectors are chromosomally encoded. An earlier study by us showed that Pasteurella multocida also inhibits the growth of M. haemolytica. However, M. haemolytica has not been isolated even from pneumonic BHS lungs that did not carry B. trehalosi or P. multocida. Consequently, we tested Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Escherichia coli, the bacteria that have been detected frequently in pneumonic BHS lungs, for possible inhibition of M. haemolytica. Neither the Staphylococcus spp. nor the Streptococcus sp. strains inhibited the growth of M. haemolytica. E. coli inhibited the growth of M. haemolytica by a proximity-dependent mechanism. Growth inhibition of M. haemolytica by several bacterial species is likely to contribute to the infrequent detection of this bacterium from pneumonic BHS lungs by culture.
TI  - Analysis and comparative genomics of ICEMh1, a novel integrative and conjugative  element (ICE) of Mannheimia haemolytica.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify and analyse the first integrative and conjugative element (ICE) from Mannheimia haemolytica, the major bacterial component of the bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex. METHODS: The novel ICEMh1 was discovered in the whole-genome sequence of M. haemolytica 42548 by sequence analysis and comparative genomics. Transfer of ICEMh1 was confirmed by conjugation into Pasteurella multocida recipient cells. RESULTS: ICEMh1 has a size of 92,345 bp and harbours 107 genes. It integrates into a chromosomal tRNA(Leu) copy. Within two resistance gene regions of approximately 7.4 and 3.3 kb, ICEMh1 harbours five genes, which confer resistance to streptomycin (strA and strB), kanamycin/neomycin (aphA1), tetracycline [tetR-tet(H)] and sulphonamides (sul2). ICEMh1 is related to the recently described ICEPmu1 and both ICEs seem to have evolved from a common ancestor. A region of ICEMh1 that is absent in ICEPmu1 was found in putative ICE regions of other M. haemolytica genomes, suggesting a recombination event between two ICEs. ICEMh1 transfers to P. multocida by conjugation, in which it also uses a tRNA(Leu) as the integration site. PCR assays and susceptibility testing confirmed the presence and activity of the ICEMh1-associated resistance genes in the P. multocida recipient. CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that ICEs, with structurally variable resistance gene regions, are present in BRD-associated Pasteurellaceae, can easily spread across genus borders and enable the acquisition of multidrug resistance via a single horizontal gene transfer event. This poses a threat to efficient antimicrobial chemotherapy of BRD-associated bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Investigation of polymerase chain reaction assays to improve detection of bacterial involvement in bovine respiratory disease.
AB  - Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) causes severe economic losses to the cattle farming industry worldwide. The major bacterial organisms contributing to the BRD complex are Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, Pasteurella multocida, and Trueperella pyogenes. The postmortem detection of these organisms in pneumonic lung tissue is generally conducted using standard culture-based techniques where the presence of therapeutic antibiotics in the tissue can inhibit bacterial isolation. In the current study, conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used to assess the prevalence of these 5 organisms in grossly pneumonic lung samples from 150 animals submitted for postmortem examination, and the results were compared with those obtained using culture techniques. Mannheimia haemolytica was detected in 51 cases (34%) by PCR and in 33 cases (22%) by culture, H. somni was detected in 35 cases (23.3%) by PCR and in 6 cases (4%) by culture, Myc. bovis was detected in 53 cases (35.3%) by PCR and in 29 cases (19.3%) by culture, P. multocida was detected in 50 cases (33.3%) by PCR and in 31 cases (20.7%) by culture, and T. pyogenes was detected in 42 cases (28%) by PCR and in 31 cases (20.7%) by culture, with all differences being statistically significant. The PCR assays indicated positive results for 111 cases (74%) whereas 82 cases (54.6%) were culture positive. The PCR assays have demonstrated a significantly higher rate of detection of all 5 organisms in cases of pneumonia in cattle in Northern Ireland than was detected by current standard procedures.
TI  - Application of enrofloxacin and orbifloxacin disks approved in Japan for susceptibility testing of representative veterinary respiratory pathogens.
AB  - In this study, susceptibilities of Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica  and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae to enrofloxacin and orbifloxacin were tested using an agar diffusion method with the commercial disks and a broth microdilution method. Good correlation between the 2 methods for enrofloxacin and orbifloxacin was observed for P. multocida (r = -0.743 and -0.818, respectively), M. haemolytica (r = -0.739 and -0.800, respectively) and A. pleuropneumoniae (r = -0.785 and -0.809, respectively). Based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute interpretive criteria for enrofloxacin, high-level categorical agreement between the 2 methods was found for P. multocida (97.9%), M. haemolytica (93.8%) and A. pleuropneumoniae (92.0%). Our findings indicate that the tested commercial disks can be applied for susceptibility testing of veterinary respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring of respiratory tract pathogens isolated from diseased cattle and pigs across Europe: the VetPath study.
AB  - VetPath is an ongoing pan-European antibiotic susceptibility monitoring programme collecting pathogens from diseased antimicrobial non-treated cattle, pigs and poultry. In the current study, 1001 isolates from cattle and pig respiratory tract infections were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities. Non-replicate lung samples or nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs were collected from animals with acute clinical signs in 11 countries during 2002-2006. Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica from cattle and P. multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Streptococcus suis from pigs were isolated by standard methods. S. suis was also isolated from meningitis cases. MICs of 16 antibiotics were assessed centrally by broth microdilution following CLSI recommendations. Results were interpreted using CLSI breakpoints where available. P. multocida (231) and M. haemolytica (138) isolates were all susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to florfenicol and spectinomycin was 0.4% and 3.5% in P. multocida, respectively, and absent in M. haemolytica isolates. Tetracycline resistance was 5.7% and 14.6% for P. multocida and M. haemolytica. In pigs, 230 P. multocida, 220 A. pleuropneumoniae and 182 S. suis isolates were recovered. Resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, tiamulin and tilmicosin was absent or <1%. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance was 3-6% and tetracycline resistance varied from 14.7% in A. pleuropneumoniae to 81.8% in S. suis. In conclusion, low resistance to antibiotics with defined clinical breakpoints, except for tetracycline, was observed among the major respiratory tract pathogens recovered from cattle and pigs. Since for approximately half of the antibiotics in this panel no CLSI-defined breakpoints were available, setting of the missing veterinary breakpoints is important.
TI  - Resistance to selected beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Susceptibility in vitro and trends in resistance to antimicrobials were determined by a dilution micromethod in a group of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica and Escherichia coli isolates from clinical cases of cattle and swine diseases in the Czech Republic from 2007 to 2011. A high susceptibility of pig and cattle respiratory pathogens to antimicrobials was found, with the exception of the moderate prevalence of M. haemolytica resistance to ampicillin. In contrast to respiratory pathogens, low susceptibility of E. coli of pig and cattle isolates to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was noted. Regarding resistance trends, an increase in levels of resistance among E. coli isolates to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was identified, but the resistance of respiratory isolates was low, with the exception of M. haemolytica. For the period of 2007-2011, there was a significant and almost continuous increase in sales (compared with population correction unit) of ceftiofur, cefquinome and other beta lactams for pigs. Consumption peaked in 2010. In the case of amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid, data showed a significant decrease in sales from 2007 to 2008, followed by a period of fluctuation. In cattle, within the groups of 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins and for the whole group of other betalactams for the period of 2007-2011, there was a significant and almost continuous increase in sales (compared with population correction unit). Consumption peaked in 2010. In the case of ceftiofur, there was a huge increase noted from 2010. In the case of amoxicillin in combination with betalactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) data shows a significant decrease from 2007 to 2008, followed by a period of fluctuation in sales.
TI  - Treatment of naturally occurring bovine respiratory disease in juvenile calves with a single administration of a florfenicol plus flunixin meglumine formulation.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of a florfenicol plus flunixin meglumine formulation in the treatment of respiratory disease was evaluated in calves less than six weeks of age, compared with a positive control group treated with a well-established florfenicol formulation. A total of 210 calves, selected from nine sites in Belgium, France and Spain, showing severe signs of respiratory disease, were randomly assigned to treatment with either florfenicol plus flunixin meglumine (Resflor; MSD Animal Health) or florfenicol (Nuflor; MSD Animal Health), both administered subcutaneously once. Animals were clinically observed daily for 10 days following treatment initiation. The predominant respiratory pathogens were Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica and Histophilus somni. All isolates were subject to in vitro sensitivity testing and found susceptible to florfenicol. In both groups, rectal temperature dropped and clinical index (depression and respiratory signs) significantly improved after treatment. Specifically, for the change in rectal temperature from pretreatment to six hours post-treatment, the florfenicol-flunixin formulation was found significantly superior to florfenicol. Moreover, the florfenicol-flunixin formulation alleviated the clinical signs of disease more rapidly, and was demonstrated to be non-inferior to florfenicol on days 4 and 10. The use of the product combining florfenicol and flunixin in calves is safe and efficacious in the treatment of outbreaks of bovine respiratory disease.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of ceftiofur crystalline-free acid following subcutaneous administration of a single dose to sheep.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the pharmacokinetics of ceftiofur crystalline-free acid (CCFA) following SC administration of a single dose to sheep. ANIMALS: 9 healthy adult female Suffolk-crossbred sheep. PROCEDURES: Each sheep was administered 6.6 mg of CCFA/kg, SC, in the cervical region once. Serial blood samples were collected at predetermined intervals for 14 days. Serum concentration of ceftiofur free-acid equivalents (CFAE) was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by compartmental and noncompartmental methods. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetics for CCFA following SC administration in sheep was best described with a 1-compartment model. Mean +/- SD area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity, peak serum concentration, and time to peak serum concentration were 206.6 +/- 24.8 mu*h/mL, 2.4 +/- 0.5 mug/mL, and 23.1 +/- 10.1 h, respectively. Serum CFAE concentrations >/= 1 mug/mL (the target serum CFAE concentration for treatment of disease caused by Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida) were maintained for 2.6 to 4.9 days. No significant adverse reactions to CCFA administration were observed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that adequate therapeutic serum concentrations of CFAE for treatment of disease caused by M haemolytica and P multocida were achieved in sheep following SC administration of a single dose (6.6 mg/kg) of CCFA. Thus, CCFA might be useful for the treatment of common respiratory tract pathogens in sheep.
TI  - Mortality of live export cattle on long-haul voyages: pathologic changes and pathogens.
AB  - The cause of death in 215 cattle on 20 long-haul live export voyages from Australia to the Middle East, Russia, and China was investigated between 2010 and 2012 using gross, histologic, and/or molecular pathology techniques. A quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was used to detect nucleic acids from viruses and bacteria known to be associated with respiratory disease in cattle: Bovine coronavirus (Betacoronavirus 1), Bovine herpesvirus 1, Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 and 2, Bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Bovine parainfluenza virus 3, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida. The most commonly diagnosed cause of death was respiratory disease (107/180, 59.4%), followed by lameness (n = 22, 12.2%), ketosis (n = 12, 6.7%), septicemia (n = 11, 6.1%), and enteric disease (n = 10, 5.6%). Two thirds (130/195) of animals from which lung samples were collected had histologic changes and/or positive qRT-PCR results indicative of infectious lung disease: 93 out of 130 (72%) had evidence of bacterial infection, 4 (3%) had viral infection, and 29 (22%) had mixed bacterial and viral infections, and for 4 (3%) the causative organism could not be identified. Bovine coronavirus was detected in up to 13% of cattle tested, and this finding is likely to have important implications for the management and treatment of respiratory disease in live export cattle. Results from the current study indicate that although overall mortality during live export voyages is low, further research into risk factors for developing respiratory disease is required.
TI  - Pathogens of bovine respiratory disease in North American feedlots conferring multidrug resistance via integrative conjugative elements.
AB  - In this study, we determined the prevalence of bovine respiratory disease (BRD)-associated viral and bacterial pathogens in cattle and characterized the genetic profiles, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and nature of antimicrobial resistance determinants in collected bacteria. Nasopharyngeal swab and lung tissue samples from 68 BRD mortalities in Alberta, Canada (n = 42), Texas (n = 6), and Nebraska (n = 20) were screened using PCR for bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, parainfluenza type 3 virus, Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni. Excepting bovine herpesvirus 1, all agents were detected. M. haemolytica (91%) and BVDV (69%) were the most prevalent, with cooccurrence in 63% of the cattle. Isolates of M. haemolytica (n = 55), P. multocida (n = 8), and H. somni (n = 10) from lungs were also collected. Among M. haemolytica isolates, a clonal subpopulation (n = 8) was obtained from a Nebraskan feedlot. All three bacterial pathogens exhibited a high rate of antimicrobial resistance, with 45% exhibiting resistance to three or more antimicrobials. M. haemolytica (n = 18), P. multocida (n = 3), and H. somni (n = 3) from Texas and Nebraska possessed integrative conjugative elements (ICE) that conferred resistance for up to seven different antimicrobial classes. ICE were shown to be transferred via conjugation from P. multocida to Escherichia coli and from M. haemolytica and H. somni to P. multocida. ICE-mediated multidrug-resistant profiles of bacterial BRD pathogens could be a major detriment to many of the therapeutic antimicrobial strategies currently used to control BRD.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic integration and modelling of florfenicol in calves.
AB  - Florfenicol was administered subcutaneously to 10 calves at a dose of 40 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) integration and modelling of the data were undertaken using a tissue cage model, which allowed comparison of microbial growth inhibition profiles in three fluids, serum, exudate and transudate. Terminal half-lives were relatively long, so that florfenicol concentrations were well maintained in all three fluids. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration were determined in vitro for six strains each of the calf pneumonia pathogens, Mannhemia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. An PK-PD integration for three serum indices provided mean values for P. multocida and M. haemolytica, respectively, of 12.6 and 10.4 for Cmax /MIC, 183 and 152 h for AUC0-24 h /MIC and 78 and 76 h for T>MIC. Average florfenicol concentrations in serum exceeded 4 x MIC and 1.5 x MIC for the periods 0-24 and 48-72 h, respectively. Ex vivo growth inhibition curves for M. haemolytica and P. multocida demonstrated a rapid (with 8 h of exposure) and marked (6 log10 reduction in bacterial count or greater) killing response, suggesting a concentration-dependent killing action. During 24-h incubation periods, inhibition of growth to a bacteriostatic level or greater was maintained in serum samples collected up to 96 h and in transudate and exudate samples harvested up to 120 h. Based on the sigmoidal Emax relationship, PK-PD modelling of the ex vivo time-kill data provided AUC0-24 h /MIC serum values for three levels of growth inhibition, bacteriostatic, bactericidal and 4 log10 decrease in bacterial count; mean values were, respectively, 8.2, 26.6 and 39.0 h for M. haemolytica and 7.6, 18.1 and 25.0 h for P. multocida. Similar values were obtained for transudate and exudate. Based on pharmacokinetic and PK-PD modelled data obtained in this study and scientific literature values for MIC distributions, Monte Carlo simulations over 100 000 trials were undertaken to predict once daily dosages of florfenicol required to provide 50% and 90% target attainment rates for three levels of growth inhibition, namely, bacteriostasis, bactericidal action and 4 log10 reduction in bacterial count.
TI  - A study on ovine pneumonic pasteurellosis: isolation and identification of Pasteurellae and their antibiogram susceptibility pattern in Haramaya District, Eastern Hararghe, Ethiopia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sheep constitute the second major component of livestock in Ethiopia. However, efficient utilization of this potential resource is hampered by combination of health problems, poor management and feed shortage. Haramaya district is one of the remote settings in Ethiopia where information about the livestock disease is not well documented. Hence this study was conducted to determine the causative agents and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial Pasteurella isolates among pneumonic ovine in Haramaya district, Eastern Hararghe, Ethiopia. RESULTS: Out of 256 samples examined, Pasteurella was isolated in 64 (25%), of which 38 (59.4%) were from lungs and 26 (40.6%) were from nasal cavities. 87.5% of the isolates were Mannheimia haemolytica and 12.5% were Pasteurella multocida. All of the isolates from the lungs were Mannheimia haemolytica whereas 69% of the isolates from nasals cavities were Mannheimia haemolytica. Age and body temperature were significantly associated with Pasteurella isolates from clinic (P < 0.05). Despite diverse in the site of origins, the isolates exhibited uniformity in sensitivity to a majority of the antibacterial agents. The most effective drug was Cholramphenicol (100%) followed by Sulfamethoxazole (89.1%) and Tetracycline (84.4%). Both species were completely resistant to Gentamycin and Vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Mannheimia haemolytica is the most common cause of ovine pneumonic pasteurellosis in the study area. The isolates were susceptible to limited antimicrobial agents. Therefore, the antimicrobial susceptibility test should be conducted before treatment, except for critical cases.
TI  - PCR assay detects Mannheimia haemolytica in culture-negative pneumonic lung tissues of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) from outbreaks in the western USA, 2009-2010.
AB  - Mannheimia haemolytica consistently causes severe bronchopneumonia and rapid death of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) under experimental conditions. However, Bibersteinia trehalosi and Pasteurella multocida have been isolated from pneumonic bighorn lung tissues more frequently than M. haemolytica by culture-based methods. We hypothesized that assays more sensitive than culture would detect M. haemolytica in pneumonic lung tissues more accurately. Therefore, our first objective was to develop a PCR assay specific for M. haemolytica and use it to determine if this organism was present in the pneumonic lungs of bighorns during the 2009-2010 outbreaks in Montana, Nevada, and Washington, USA. Mannheimia haemolytica was detected by the species-specific PCR assay in 77% of archived pneumonic lung tissues that were negative by culture. Leukotoxin-negative M. haemolytica does not cause fatal pneumonia in bighorns. Therefore, our second objective was to determine if the leukotoxin gene was also present in the lung tissues as a means of determining the leukotoxicity of M. haemolytica that were present in the lungs. The leukotoxin-specific PCR assay detected leukotoxin gene in 91% of lung tissues that were negative for M. haemolytica by culture. Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, an organism associated with bighorn pneumonia, was detected in 65% of pneumonic bighorn lung tissues by PCR or culture. A PCR assessment of distribution of these pathogens in the nasopharynx of healthy bighorns from populations that did not experience an all-age die-off in the past 20 yr revealed that M. ovipneumoniae was present in 31% of the animals whereas leukotoxin-positive M. haemolytica was present in only 4%. Taken together, these results indicate that culture-based methods are not reliable for detection of M. haemolytica and that leukotoxin-positive M. haemolytica was a predominant etiologic agent of the pneumonia outbreaks of 2009-2010.
TI  - Respiratory syncytial virus infection in cattle.
AB  - Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a cause of respiratory disease in cattle worldwide. It has an integral role in enzootic pneumonia in young dairy calves and summer pneumonia in nursing beef calves. Furthermore, bovine RSV infection can predispose calves to secondary bacterial infection by organisms such as Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni, resulting in bovine respiratory disease complex, the most prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality among feedlot cattle. Even in cases where animals do not succumb to bovine respiratory disease complex, there can be long-term losses in production performance. This includes reductions in feed efficiency and rate of gain in the feedlot, as well as reproductive performance, milk production, and longevity in the breeding herd. As a result, economic costs to the cattle industry from bovine respiratory disease have been estimated to approach $1 billion annually due to death losses, reduced performance, and costs of vaccinations and treatment modalities. Human and bovine RSV are closely related viruses with similarities in histopathologic lesions and mechanisms of immune modulation induced following infection. Therefore, where appropriate, we provide comparisons between RSV infections in humans and cattle. This review article discusses key aspects of RSV infection of cattle, including epidemiology and strain variability, clinical signs and diagnosis, experimental infection, gross and microscopic lesions, innate and adaptive immune responses, and vaccination strategies.
TI  - In vitro activity and rodent efficacy of clinafloxacin for bovine and swine respiratory disease.
AB  - Clinafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone that was originally developed and subsequently abandoned in the late 1990s as a human health antibiotic for respiratory diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the activity of clinafloxacin as a possible treatment for respiratory disease in cattle and pigs. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommended procedures with recent strains from the Zoetis culture collection. Rodent efficacy was determined in CD-1 mice infected systemically or intranasally with bovine Mannheimia haemolytica or Pasteurella multocida, or swine Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and administered clinafloxacin for determination of ED50 (efficacious dose-50%) values. The MIC90 values for clinafloxacin against bovine P. multocida, M. haemolytica, Histophilus somni, and M. bovis were 0.125, 0.5, 0.125, and 1 mug/ml, respectively, and the MIC90 values against swine P. multocida, A. pleuropneumoniae, S. suis, and M. hyopneumoniae were i0.03, i0.03, 0.125, and i0.008 mug/ml, respectively. Efficacy in mouse models showed average ED50 values of 0.019 mg/kg/dose in the bovine M. haemolytica systemic infection model, 0.55 mg/kg in the bovine P. multocida intranasal lung challenge model, 0.08 mg/kg/dose in the bovine P. multocida systemic infection model, and 0.7 mg/kg/dose in the swine A. pleuropneumoniae systemic infection model. Clinafloxacin shows good in vitro activity and efficacy in mouse models and may be a novel treatment alternative for the treatment of respiratory disease in cattle and pigs.
TI  - Effect of subtherapeutic vs. therapeutic administration of macrolides on antimicrobial resistance in Mannheimia haemolytica and enterococci isolated from beef cattle.
AB  - Macrolides are the first-line treatment against bovine respiratory disease (BRD), and are also used to treat infections in humans. The macrolide, tylosin phosphate, is often included in the diet of cattle as a preventative for liver abscesses in many regions of the world outside of Europe. This study investigated the effects of administering macrolides to beef cattle either systemically through a single subcutaneous injection (therapeutic) or continuously in-feed (subtherapeutic), on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Mannheimia haemolytica and Enterococcus spp. isolated from the nasopharynx and faeces, respectively. Nasopharyngeal and faecal samples were collected weekly over 28 days from untreated beef steers and from steers injected once with tilmicosin or tulathromycin or continuously fed tylosin phosphate at dosages recommended by manufacturers. Tilmicosin and tulathromycin were effective in lowering (P < 0.05) the prevalence of M. haemolytica, whereas subtherapeutic tylosin had no effect. M. haemolytica isolated from control- and macrolide-treated animals were susceptible to macrolides as well as to other antibiotics. Major bacteria co-isolated with M. haemolytica from the nasopharynx included Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus spp., Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Bacillus spp. With the exception of M. haemolytica and P. multocida, erythromycin resistance was frequently found in other isolated species. Both methods of macrolide administration increased (P < 0.05) the proportion of erythromycin resistant enterococci within the population, which was comprised almost exclusively of Enterococcus hirae. Injectable macrolides impacted both respiratory and enteric microbes, whereas orally administered macrolides only influenced enteric bacteria.
TI  - Immunogenicity of Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica outer membrane vesicles.
AB  - Pasteurella multocida is able to cause disease in humans and in a wide range of animal hosts, including fowl cholera in birds, atrophic rhinitis in pigs, and snuffles in rabbits. Together with Mannheimia haemolytica, P. multocida also represents a major bacterial causative agent of bovine respiratory disease (BRD), which is one of the most important causes for economic losses for the cattle backgrounding and feedlot industry. Commercially available vaccines only partially prevent infections caused by P. multocida and M. haemolytica. Thus, this study characterized the immunogenicity of P. multocida and M. haemolytica outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) upon intranasal immunization of BALB/c mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) revealed that OMVs derived from P. multocida or M. haemolytica are able to induce robust humoral and mucosal immune responses against the respective donor strain. In addition, also significant cross-immunogenic potential was observed for both OMV types. Colonization studies showed that a potential protective immune response against P. multocida is not only achieved by immunization with P. multocida OMVs, but also by immunization with OMVs derived from M. haemolytica. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that M. haemolytica OMVs induce a more complex immune response compared to P. multocida OMVs. The outer membrane proteins OmpA, OmpH, and P6 were identified as the three major immunogenic proteins of P. multocida OMVs. Amongst others, the serotype 1-specific antigen, an uncharacterized outer membrane protein, as well as the outer membrane proteins P2 and OmpA were found to be the most important antigens of M. haemolytica OMVs. These findings are useful for the future development of broad-spectrum OMV based vaccines against BRD and other infections caused by P. multocida or M. haemolytica.
TI  - Antimicrobial multidrug resistance and coresistance patterns of Mannheimia haemolytica isolated from bovine respiratory disease cases--a three-year (2009-2011) retrospective analysis.
AB  - Bovine respiratory disease continues to be the most important ailment of feed yard cattle. While the disease is multifactorial in nature, therapy continues to target the primary bacterial pathogens, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni. A survey of records from a single diagnostic laboratory was conducted to evaluate the percentage of M. haemolytica isolates that were resistant to multiple antimicrobials and if coresistance patterns could be detected. All susceptibility test results for M. haemolytica recovered from lung tissues of cattle were eligible for inclusion in the survey. There were no isolates over the course of the analysis that were resistant to all 6 antimicrobials, primarily due to a lack of resistance to ceftiofur. In 2009, just over 5% of isolates were resistant to 5 or more antimicrobials (pan-resistant). In 2011, more than 35% of the M. haemolytica isolates were characterized as pan-resistant. Significant antimicrobial coresistance patterns were only seen with oxytetracycline and tilmicosin; bacterial isolates that were resistant to either oxytetracycline or tilmicosin were more likely to be resistant to at least one other antimicrobial. The mechanisms by which M. haemolytica is developing multidrug resistance warrant investigation if antimicrobial utility in the therapy of bovine respiratory disease is to be preserved.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of florfenicol for calf pneumonia pathogens.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of florfenicol were investigated for the bovine respiratory tract pathogens, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. Three in vitro indices of efficacy and potency were determined; minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and in vitro time-kill curves for six pathogenic strains of each organism. Each was monitored in two matrices, Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) and calf serum. MBC:MIC ratios were low, 1.8 : 1 for M haemolytica in both MHB and serum and 2.4 : 1 and 2.1 : 1 for P multocida in MHB and serum, respectively. The killing action of florfenicol had the characteristics of concentration dependency against M haemolytica and codependency (on time and concentration) against P multocida. Modelling of the time-kill data after 24 hours exposure was undertaken to quantify three levels of activity for the ratio, area under concentration-time curve over 24 hours (AUC24h)/MIC; bacteriostatic action (no change in bacterial count), 3log10 reduction and 4log10 reduction in bacterial count. Mean AUC24h/MIC values for P multocida in MHB (and serum) were 22.0 (23.3) hour, 34.5 (39.9) hour and 45.8 (50.4) hour, respectively. Similar numerical values were obtained for M haemolytica. For both bacterial species, interstrain variability was low; coefficients of variation ( per cent) in serum for 3log10 and 4log10 reductions in count were, respectively, 14.3 and 24.1 for P multocida and 7.8 and 11.4 for M haemolytica. These data form a rational basis for dosage selection for treatment of calf pneumonia caused by M haemolytica or P multocida.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of marbofloxacin for calf pneumonia pathogens.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of the fluoroquinolone, marbofloxacin, were determined for the bovine respiratory tract pathogens Mannheima haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. For six pathogenic isolates of each organism, three in vitro indices of efficacy and potency were determined, namely, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill curves. Each parameter was determined in two matrices, Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) and calf serum. For serum, MBC:MIC ratios were 2.7:1 (M. haemolytica) and 2.4:1 (P. multocida). The killing action of marbofloxacin had the characteristics of concentration dependency against M. haemolytica and co-dependency (on time and concentration) against P. multocida. To confirm the characteristics of the time-kill profiles, growth inhibition produced by marbofloxacin was also established ex vivo in three biological fluids, calf serum, exudate and transudate, harvested from a tissue cage model. The in vitro time-kill data were modelled with pharmacokinetic properties of marbofloxacin, established by intramuscular administration in calves at a dose of 2 mg/kg; three levels of activity, namely bacteriostatic, 3 log10 reduction and 4 log10 reduction in bacterial counts were determined. Mean AUC(24h)/MIC values (with percentage coefficients of variation indicating inter-isolate variability) for M. haemolytica, based on serum MICs, were 31.3 (41.6), 57.7 (42.4) and 79.2 (44.6) h, respectively. Corresponding values for MHB were 20.5 (58.0), 40.5 (51.8) and 51.2 (24.30) h, respectively. When allowance was made for binding of marbofloxacin to serum protein, the AUC(24h)/MIC values for serum were similar to those for MHB. Numerical AUC(24h)/MIC values for P. multocida were slightly lower than those obtained for M. haemolytica. These data establish for the first time inter-isolate variability in AUC(24h)/MIC values required for three levels of bacterial kill for two pathogenic species and thereby provide an indication of variability in serum concentration that might be required to achieve efficacy in clinical subjects.
TI  - Effect of calf age and administration route of initial multivalent modified-live  virus vaccine on humoral and cell-mediated immune responses following subsequent administration of a booster vaccination at weaning in beef calves.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare immune responses following modified-live virus (MLV) vaccination at weaning after intranasal or SC administration of an MLV vaccine to beef calves at 2 or 70 days of age. ANIMALS: 184 calves. PROCEDURES: Calves were allocated to 1 of 5 groups. The IN2 (n = 37) and IN70 (37) groups received an MLV vaccine containing bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) types 1 and 2, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and parainfluenza 3 virus intranasally and a Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida bacterin SC at median ages of 2 and 70 days, respectively. The SC2 (n = 36) and SC70 (37) groups received a 7-way MLV vaccine containing BHV1, BVDV1, BVDV2, BRSV, parainfluenza 3 virus, M haemolytica, and P multocida SC at median ages of 2 and 70 days, respectively; the control group (37) remained unvaccinated until weaning. All calves received the 7-way MLV vaccine SC at median ages of 217 (weaning) and 231 days. Serum neutralizing antibody (SNA) titers against BHV1, BVDV1, and BRSV and intranasal IgA concentrations were determined at median ages of 2, 70, 140, 217, and 262 days. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) against BHV1, BRSV, BVDV1, and P multocida was determined for 16 calves/group. RESULTS: At median ages of 140 and 217 days, BVDV1 SNA titers were significantly higher for the SC70 group than those for the other groups. Intranasal IgA concentrations and CMI increased over time for all groups. Vaccination at weaning increased SNA titers and CMI in all groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: SC administration of an MLV vaccine to 70-day-old calves significantly increased BVDV1 antibody titers before weaning.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of tracheal antimicrobial peptide against respiratory pathogens of cattle.
AB  - Tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP) is a beta-defensin produced by mucosal epithelial cells of cattle. Although effective against several human pathogens, the activity of this bovine peptide against the bacterial pathogens that cause bovine respiratory disease have not been reported. This study compared the antibacterial effects of synthetic TAP against Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Pasteurella multocida, and Mycoplasma bovis. Bactericidal activity against M. bovis was not detected. In contrast, the Pasteurellaceae bacteria showed similar levels of susceptibility to that of Escherichia coli, with 0.125mug TAP inhibiting growth in a radial diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1.56-6.25mug/ml in a bactericidal assay. Significant differences among isolates were not observed. Sequencing of exon 2 of the TAP gene from 23 cattle revealed a prevalent non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A137G, encoding either serine or asparagine at residue 20 of the mature peptide. The functional effect of this SNP was tested against M. haemolytica using synthetic peptides. The bactericidal effect of the asparagine-containing peptide was consistently higher than the serine-containing peptide. Bactericidal activities were similar for an acapsular mutant of M. haemolytica compared to the wild type. These findings indicate that the Pasteurellaceae bacteria that cause bovine respiratory disease are susceptible to killing by bovine TAP and appear not to have evolved resistance, whereas M. bovis appears to be resistant. A non-synonymous SNP was identified in the coding region of the TAP gene, and the corresponding peptides vary in their bactericidal activity against M. haemolytica.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic integration and modelling of marbofloxacin in calves for Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of marbofloxacin were established in calves for six strains of each of the pneumonia pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. The distribution of marbofloxacin into inflamed (exudate) and non-inflamed (transudate) tissue cage fluids allowed comparison with the serum concentration-time profile. To establish the PD profile, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) and calf serum. Moderately higher MICs were obtained for serum compared to MHB. An initial integration of PK-PD data established C(max)/MIC ratios of 45.0 and AUC(24h)/MIC values of 174.7 h, based on serum MICs, for both bacterial species. Using bacterial time-kill curves, generated ex vivo for serum marbofloxacin concentrations, PK-PD modelling established three levels of growth inhibition: AUC(24 h)/MIC ratios for no reduction, 3 log(10) and 4 log(10) reductions in bacterial count from the initial inoculum count were 41.9, 59.5 and 68.0 h for M. haemolytica and 48.6, 64.9 and 74.8 h for P. multocida, on average respectively. Inter-strain variability for 3 log(10) and 4 log(10) reductions in bacterial count was smaller for P. multocida than for M. haemolytica. In conjunction with literature data on MIC(90) values, the present results allowed prediction of dosages for efficacy for each organism for the three levels of growth inhibition.
TI  - The OmpA family of proteins: roles in bacterial pathogenesis and immunity.
AB  - The OmpA family of outer membrane proteins is a group of genetically related, heat-modifiable, surface-exposed, porin proteins that are in high-copy number in the outer membrane of mainly Gram-negative bacteria. OmpA proteins are characterized by an N-terminal domain that forms an eight-stranded, anti-parallel beta barrel, which is embedded in the outer membrane. The C-terminal domain is globular and located in the periplasmic space. Escherichia coli OmpA is the best characterized of the proteins. Other well-characterized OmpA-equivalent proteins from pathogenic bacteria include Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprF, Haemophilus influenzae P5, Klebsiella pneumoniae OmpA, and Chlamydia trachomatis major outer membrane protein (MOMP). OmpA from the veterinary pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica, Haemophilus parasuis, Leptospira interrogans, and Pasteurella multocida have been studied to a lesser extent. Among many of the pathogenic bacteria, OmpA proteins have important pathogenic roles including bacterial adhesion, invasion, or intracellular survival as well as evasion of host defenses or stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These pathogenic roles are most commonly associated with central nervous system, respiratory and urogenital diseases. Alternatively, OmpA family proteins can serve as targets of the immune system with immunogenicity related to surface-exposed loops of the molecule. In several cases, OmpA proteins are under evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.
TI  - Inhibition of protein synthesis on the ribosome by tildipirosin compared with other veterinary macrolides.
AB  - Tildipirosin is a 16-membered-ring macrolide developed to treat bacterial pathogens, including Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida, that cause respiratory tract infections in cattle and swine. Here we evaluated the efficacy of tildipirosin at inhibiting protein synthesis on the ribosome (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)], 0.23 +/- 0.01 muM) and compared it with the established veterinary macrolides tylosin, tilmicosin, and tulathromycin. Mutation and methylation at key rRNA nucleotides revealed differences in the interactions of these macrolides within their common ribosomal binding site.
TI  - A ten-year (2000-2009) study of antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria that cause bovine respiratory disease complex--Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni--in the United States and Canada.
AB  - Bovine isolates of Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni, collected from 2000 to 2009, were tested for in vitro susceptibility to ceftiofur, penicillin, danofloxacin, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, tetracycline, tilmicosin, and tulathromycin. Ceftiofur remained very active against all isolates. Penicillin retained good activity against P. multocida and H. somni isolates with no appreciable changes in susceptibility or minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions with time. While there was no obvious trend, the percent of M. haemolytica that were susceptible to penicillin ranged from 40.9% to 66.7%. Danofloxacin MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for M. haemolytica and P. multocida did not change beyond a single dilution over the 6 years it was included in the testing panel. The MIC(90) for H. somni increased beyond 1 dilution. Enrofloxacin MIC(50) values for the 3 pathogens also did not change over time, unlike the MIC(90) values, which increased by at least 4-doubling dilutions. Ninety percent or more of M. haemolytica and H. somni isolates were susceptible to florfenicol, while susceptibility among P. multocida was 79% or greater. Less than 50% of the isolates tested as susceptible to tetracycline in many of the years. All 3 organisms showed declines in tilmicosin and tulathromycin MIC(50) and MIC(90) values over the years in which they were tested.
TI  - Proximity-dependent inhibition of growth of Mannheimia haemolytica by Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Bibersteinia trehalosi have been identified in the lungs of pneumonic bighorn sheep (BHS; Ovis canadensis). Of these pathogens, M. haemolytica has been shown to consistently cause fatal pneumonia in BHS under experimental conditions. However, M. haemolytica has been isolated by culture less frequently than the other bacteria. We hypothesized that the growth of M. haemolytica is inhibited by other bacteria in the lungs of BHS. The objective of this study was to determine whether P. multocida inhibits the growth of M. haemolytica. Although in monoculture both bacteria exhibited similar growth characteristics, in coculture with P. multocida there was a clear inhibition of growth of M. haemolytica. The inhibition was detected at mid-log phase and continued through the stationary phase. When cultured in the same medium, the growth of M. haemolytica was inhibited when both bacteria were separated by a membrane that allowed contact (pore size, 8.0 mum) but not when they were separated by a membrane that limited contact (pore size, 0.4 mum). Lytic bacteriophages or bactericidal compounds could not be detected in the culture supernatant fluid from monocultures of P. multocida or from P. multocida-M. haemolytica cocultures. These results indicate that P. multocida inhibits the growth of M. haemolytica by a contact- or proximity-dependent mechanism. If the inhibition of growth of M. haemolytica by P. multocida occurs in vivo as well, it could explain the inconsistent isolation of M. haemolytica from the lungs of pneumonic BHS.
TI  - Pasteurellaceae isolated from bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) from Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the species and biovariants of Pasteurellaceae isolated from clinically normal bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) or bighorn sheep with evidence of respiratory disease. SAMPLE: 675 Pasteurellaceae isolates from 290 free-ranging bighorn sheep in Idaho, Oregon and Wyoming. PROCEDURES: Nasal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were inoculated onto selective and nonselective blood agar media. Representatives of each colony type were classified via a biovariant scheme. The association of respective beta-hemolytic isolates with respiratory disease was evaluated via chi(2) analyses. RESULTS: Bacterial isolates belonged to 4 species: Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Bibersteinia (Pasteurella) trehalosi. Within the latter 3 species, 112 subspecies, biotypes, and biovariants were identified. Bibersteinia trehalosi 2 and B trehalosi 2B constituted 345 of 675 (51%) isolates. Most (597/618 [97%]) isolates from adult sheep were from clinically normal animals, whereas most (47/57 [82%]) isolates from lambs were from animals with evidence of respiratory disease. Twenty-two Pasteurellaceae biovariants were isolated from sheep with respiratory disease; 17 of these biovariants were also isolated from clinically normal sheep. The ability of isolates to cause beta-hemolysis on blood agar was associated with respiratory disease in adult bighorn sheep (OR, 2.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 6.07). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Bighorn lambs appeared more susceptible to respiratory disease caused by Pasteurellaceae than did adult sheep. beta-Hemolytic Pasteurellaceae isolates were more likely to be associated with respiratory disease than were non-beta-hemolytic isolates in adult sheep. Identification of Pasteurellaceae with the greatest pathogenic potential will require studies to estimate the risk of disease from specific biovariants.
TI  - Multiplex PCR to identify macrolide resistance determinants in Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - The bacterial pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida are major etiological agents in respiratory tract infections of cattle. Although these infections can generally be successfully treated with veterinary macrolide antibiotics, a few recent isolates have shown resistance to these drugs. Macrolide resistance in members of the family Pasteurellaceae is conferred by combinations of at least three genes: erm(42), which encodes a monomethyltransferase and confers a type I MLS(B) (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B) phenotype; msr(E), which encodes a macrolide efflux pump; and mph(E), which encodes a macrolide-inactivating phosphotransferase. Here, we describe a multiplex PCR assay that detects the presence of erm(42), msr(E), and mph(E) and differentiates between these genes. In addition, the assay distinguishes P. multocida from M. haemolytica by amplifying distinctive fragments of the 23S rRNA (rrl) genes. One rrl fragment acts as a general indicator of gammaproteobacterial species and confirms whether the PCR assay has functioned as intended on strains that are negative for erm(42), msr(E), and mph(E). The multiplex system has been tested on more than 40 selected isolates of P. multocida and M. haemolytica and correlated with MICs for the veterinary macrolides tulathromycin and tilmicosin, and the newer compounds gamithromycin and tildipirosin. The multiplex PCR system gives a rapid and robustly accurate determination of macrolide resistance genotypes and bacterial genus, matching results from microbiological methods and whole-genome sequencing.
TI  - Interaction between mammalian cells and Pasteurella multocida B:2. Adherence, invasion and intracellular survival.
AB  - A Pasteurella multocida B:2 strain from a case of bovine haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) and a derivative, JRMT12, that was attenuated by a deletion in the aroA gene, were shown to adhere to, invade and survive within cultured embryonic bovine lung (EBL) cells. By comparison, bovine strains of Mannheimia haemolytica serotype A1 and P. multocida serotype A:3, although able to adhere to EBL cells, were not found intracellularly. The B:2 strains were viable intracellularly over a 7 h period, although a steady decline in viability was noted with time. Entry into the mammalian cells was inhibited by cytochalasin D, indicating that cell uptake was by an actin-dependent process. Viability assessment of EBL cells by trypan blue staining indicated that none of the bacterial strains was toxic for the EBL cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that, after entry into the mammalian cells, the B:2 strain resided in a vacuolar compartment. However, only a low percentage of mammalian cells appeared to contain one or more P. multocida B:2, suggesting that only certain EBL cells in the population were capable of being invaded by, or of taking up, the bacteria. TEM showed that P. multocida A:3 and M. haemolytica A:1 were found loosely adhering to the cell surface of EBL cells and were not detected intracellularly. The cell-invasive capacity of P. multocida B:2 may be a virulence property related to its ability to translocate from the respiratory tract into the blood stream.

TI  - Causes of pneumonia epizootics among bighorn sheep, Western United States, 2008-2010.
AB  - Epizootic pneumonia of bighorn sheep is a devastating disease of uncertain etiology. To help clarify the etiology, we used culture and culture-independent methods to compare the prevalence of the bacterial respiratory pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica, Bibersteinia trehalosi, Pasteurella multocida, and Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae in lung tissue from 44 bighorn sheep from herds affected by 8 outbreaks in the western United States. M. ovipneumoniae, the only agent detected at significantly higher prevalence in animals from outbreaks (95%) than in animals from unaffected healthy populations (0%), was the most consistently detected agent and the only agent that exhibited single strain types within each outbreak. The other respiratory pathogens were frequently but inconsistently detected, as were several obligate anaerobic bacterial species, all of which might represent secondary or opportunistic infections that could contribute to disease severity. These data provide evidence that M. ovipneumoniae plays a primary role in the etiology of epizootic pneumonia of bighorn sheep.
TI  - Evidence-based effectiveness of vaccination against Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni in feedlot cattle for mitigating the incidence and effect of bovine respiratory disease complex.
AB  - Bovine respiratory disease complex is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle. A number of vaccines against bacterial respiratory pathogens are commercially available and researchers have studied their impact on morbidity, mortality, and other disease outcome measures in feedlot cattle. A systematic review will provide veterinarians with a rigorous and transparent evaluation of the published literature to estimate the extent of vaccine effect. Unfortunately, the published body of evidence does not provide a consistent estimate of the direction and magnitude of effectiveness in feedlot cattle vaccination against Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, or Histophilus somni.
TI  - Comparison of antemortem antimicrobial treatment regimens to antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of postmortem lung isolates from feedlot cattle with bronchopneumonia.
AB  - A retrospective study was performed to compare the treatment regimens in feedlot  cattle that died with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) to the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the microorganisms isolated from lungs. Forty-three cattle submitted by the Willard Sparks Beef Research Center (WSBRC) to the Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory for postmortem examination during 2007 had bronchopneumonia (acute = 16, subacute = 5, or chronic = 22). Lungs from cattle were cultured aerobically (40 cattle) and for Mycoplasma spp. (34 cattle). Susceptibility panels were performed. At least 1 BRD pathogen (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, or Arcanobacterium pyogenes) was isolated from 39 cattle, and 77% (30/39) had multiple organisms recovered. Mycoplasmal infections were common (25/34) and a major component of mixed infections (24/25). The majority (60%) of the M. haemolytica, P. multocida, and H. somni isolates were resistant to tetracycline. Most of the H. somni isolates (67%) were susceptible to tilmicosin (Ti), enrofloxacin (En), ceftiofur (Ce), and florfenicol, despite extensive treatment with Ti, En, and Ce (75% of isolates were from cattle that received each antimicrobial once). Most of the M. haemolytica (65%) and P. multocida (79%) isolates were susceptible to En and Ce, despite antemortem treatment of cattle with these antimicrobials. Hence, the current study reports a discrepancy between the antemortem treatment of clinical BRD and the susceptibility patterns of the bacteria isolated from lungs postmortem. Based on these findings, factors other than antimicrobial resistance are playing a role in the death of feedlot cattle with BRD.
TI  - Cross protection of a Mannheimia haemolytica A1 Lkt-/Pasteurella multocida DeltahyaE bovine respiratory disease vaccine against experimental challenge with Mannheimia haemolytica A6 in calves.
AB  - Bovine respiratory disease causes significant economic losses in both beef and dairy calf industries. Although multi-factorial in nature, the disease is characterized by an acute fibrinous lobar pneumonia typically associated with the isolation of Mannheimia haemolytica. M. haemolytica A1 and A6 are the two most commonly isolated serotypes from cattle, however, the majority of vaccines have not demonstrated cross-serotype protection. In the current study, the efficacy of a novel, attenuated live vaccine, containing both M. haemolytica serotype A1 and Pasteurella multocida, was evaluated in calves challenged with M. haemolytica serotype A6. Although the challenge was more severe than expected, vaccinated calves had reduced clinical scores, lower mortality, and significantly lower lung lesion scores compared to the placebo-vaccinated control group. The results demonstrate that vaccination with an attenuated live vaccine containing M. haemolytica serotype A1 can protect calves against clinical disease following challenge with M. haemolytica serotype A6.
TI  - Epidemiology of Mycoplasma bovis in Pennsylvania veal calves.
AB  - The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence and incidence of Mycoplasma bovis, a common cause of pneumonia, in veal calves. Using simple random sampling, 252 calves from 4 veal herds located in central Pennsylvania were selected and longitudinally followed for monthly collection of nasal swabs. Bronchial swabs and lung lesions were collected at the slaughterhouse. Nasal, bronchial, and lung lesion swabs were cultured for bacterial respiratory pathogens. Ninety lung lesions were identified, of which 41.1, 1.1, 1.1, 7.8, and 4.4% were culture positive for M. bovis alone, Pasteurella multocida alone, Mannheimia haemolytica alone, M. bovis and P. multocida co-infection, and M. bovis and M. haemolytica co-infection, respectively. The data indicate that potential interventions, such as therapeutics, vaccines, or management control measures, would be most effective before 50 d of age based upon the cumulative incidence of colonization.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic testing of marbofloxacin administered as a single injection for the treatment of bovine respiratory disease.
AB  - New approaches in Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) integration suggested that marbofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone already licensed for the treatment of bovine respiratory disease at a daily dosage of 2 mg/kg for 3-5 days, would be equally clinically effective at 10 mg/kg once (Forcyl((R))), whilst also reducing the risk of resistance. This marbofloxacin dosage regimen was studied using mutant prevention concentration (MPC), PK simulation, PK/PD integration and an in vitro dynamic system. This system simulated the concentration-time profile of marbofloxacin in bovine plasma established in vivo after a single 10 mg/kg intramuscular dose and killing curves of field isolated Pasteurellaceae strains of high (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) MIC </= 0.03 mug/mL), average (MIC of 0.12-0.25 mug/mL) and low (MIC of 1 mug/mL) susceptibility to marbofloxacin. The marbofloxacin MPC values were 2- to 4-fold the MIC values for all Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida tested. Marbofloxacin demonstrated a concentration-dependent killing profile with bactericidal activity observed within 1 h for most strains. No resistance development (MIC >/= 4 mug/mL) was detected in the dynamic tests. Target values for risk of resistance PK/PD surrogates (area under the curve (AUC) AUC(24 h) /MPC and T(>MPC) /T(MSW) ratio) were achieved for all clinically susceptible pathogens. The new proposed dosing regimen was validated in vitro and by PK/PD integration confirming the single-injection short-acting antibiotic concept.
TI  - Survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in Europe.
AB  - A monitoring programme conducted in Europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cases between 2002 and 2008. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. For respiratory pathogens, Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (MIC</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of M haemolytica strains were resistant (MIC>/=4 microg/ml). Histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). Mycoplasma bovis MIC (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. For mastitis pathogens, the majority of Escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568 and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with MIC centred on 0.25 microg/ml. Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with MIC centred on 1 microg/ml. Marbofloxacin MIC for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published MIC results.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and sensitivity to tulathromycin in goat respiratory bacterial isolates.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia is a common and often life-threatening respiratory problem in both meat and dairy goats. Options for approved antibiotic therapy in goats to combat these bacterial infections are severely limited and frequently drugs must be used in an extra-label manner. Tulathromycin, a triamilide macrolide antimicrobial drug shown to be effective against swine and cattle respiratory bacterial agents, has been identified as a potentially useful drug in caprines. The present study was conducted to determine the susceptibility of recognized bacterial respiratory pathogens to commonly prescribed antimicrobials, with a particular emphasis on the efficacy of tulathromycin against these agents. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing using microbroth dilution was performed on a collection of 45 Mannheimia haemolytica, 11 Pasteurella multocida, and 11 Bibersteinia trehalosi isolates from the lungs of goats with clinical pneumonia. To further characterize efficacy of tulathromycin against these pathogens, minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) testing and kinetic killing assays were conducted. Most isolates were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested; however, increased resistance as demonstrated by higher MIC values was seen in all species to penicillin, in P. multocida to sulfadimethoxine, and in B. trehalosi to the tetracyclines. All isolates were susceptible to tulathromycin, which demonstrated a high killing efficiency in both bactericidal assays. Results of this study indicate that most goat pneumonic bacterial pathogens remain susceptible to commonly prescribed antibiotics, although some evidence of resistance was seen to certain drugs; and that tulathromycin is highly effective against goat respiratory pathogens which could make it a valuable medication in this species.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated florfenicol resistance in Mannheimia haemolytica isolated from cattle.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse a florfenicol-resistant Mannheimia haemolytica isolated from a calf to determine the genetic basis of its florfenicol-resistance. The antimicrobial susceptibility and plasmid content of the isolate were determined. A florfenicol resistant plasmid carrying the floR gene was identified by PCR and transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 and HB101 strains. The plasmid was then mapped and sequenced completely. The isolate was resistant to chloramphenicol, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, kanamycin, dihydrostreptomycin, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, and amoxicillin; it carried a floR plasmid of 7.7kb, designated pMH1405. The mobilisation and replication genes of pMH1405 showed extensive similarity to the 5.1-kb pDN1 plasmid from Dichelobacter nodosus and the 10.8-kb pCCK381 plasmid from Pasteurella multocida. An adjacent 2.4-kb segment was highly homologous to the TnfloR region of the E. coli BN10660 plasmid. A plasmid-mediated floR gene was responsible for florfenicol resistance in the bovine respiratory tract pathogen M. haemolytica. The pMH1405 plasmid is the smallest floR-carrying plasmid reported to date. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a florfenicol-resistant gene in M. haemolytica.
TI  - ICEPmu1, an integrative conjugative element (ICE) of Pasteurella multocida: structure and transfer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) have not been detected in Pasteurella multocida. In this study the multiresistance ICEPmu1 from bovine P. multocida was analysed for its core genes and its ability to conjugatively transfer into strains of the same and different genera. METHODS: ICEPmu1 was identified during whole genome sequencing. Coding sequences were predicted by bioinformatic tools and manually curated using the annotation software ERGO. Conjugation into P. multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica and Escherichia coli recipients was performed by mating assays. The presence of ICEPmu1 and its circular intermediate in the recipient strains was confirmed by PCR and sequence analysis. Integration sites were sequenced. Susceptibility testing of the ICEPmu1-carrying recipients was conducted by broth microdilution. RESULTS: The 82 214 bp ICEPmu1 harbours 88 genes. The core genes of ICEPmu1, which are involved in excision/integration and conjugative transfer, resemble those found in a 66 641 bp ICE from Histophilus somni. ICEPmu1 integrates into a tRNA(Leu) and is flanked by 13 bp direct repeats. It is able to conjugatively transfer to P. multocida, M. haemolytica and E. coli, where it also uses a tRNA(Leu) for integration and produces closely related 13 bp direct repeats. PCR assays and susceptibility testing confirmed the presence and the functional activity of the ICEPmu1-associated resistance genes in the recipient strains. CONCLUSIONS: The observation that the multiresistance ICEPmu1 is present in a bovine P. multocida and can easily spread across strain and genus boundaries underlines the risk of a rapid dissemination of multiple resistance genes, which will distinctly decrease the therapeutic options.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of a new 450 mg/ml florfenicol formulation administered intramuscularly in the treatment of bacterial bovine respiratory disease.
AB  - The objective of the study was the safety and efficacy evaluation of a new 450 mg/ml florfenicol formulation in the treatment of naturally occurring respiratory disease when administered intramuscularly, compared with a positive control group treated with the well-established 300 mg/ml formulation. A total of 174 calves, selected from five sites in France and Spain, aged from 1 to 17 months, showing severe signs of respiratory disease, were randomly assigned to treatment with either the 300 mg/ml (3 ml/45 kg; Nuflor; MSD Animal Health) or 450 mg/ml (2 ml/45 kg; Nuflor Minidose; MSD Animal Health) florfenicol formulation, both administered intramuscularly twice, two days apart. Animals were clinically observed daily for 14 days following treatment initiation. The predominant pathogens present in pretreatment respiratory tract samples were Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. Mycoplasma bovis and Histophilus somni were also present. All isolates were subjected to in vitro sensitivity testing and found susceptible to florfenicol. In both treatment groups, rectal temperature dropped and clinical index (depression and respiratory signs) significantly improved (P<0.05) after treatment. As a result, 97.7 per cent of the 450 mg/ml florfenicol formulation-treated animals were considered treatment successes on day 5. On day 14, 67.82 per cent of the animals were classified as treatment successes and among them 63.22 per cent were cured. The intramuscular injection of the new 450 mg/ml florfenicol formulation was found equally efficacious as the original 300 mg/ml formulation.
TI  - Prevalence of respiratory pathogens in diseased, non-vaccinated, routinely medicated veal calves.
AB  - The prevalence of respiratory pathogens in diseased veal calves was determined in 24 respiratory disease outbreaks in 15 herds in Belgium. Bacteria were cultured from nasopharyngeal swabs and seroconversion against viruses and Mycoplasma bovis was determined on paired sera. At the individual calf level, Mycoplasma species, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida, were isolated from 70.5 per cent, 21.5 per cent and 26.0 per cent of swabs, respectively. At the herd level, the presence of M bovis could be confirmed in 84.6 per cent of the herds examined. Seroconversion against bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) was present in 71.4 per cent of herds, parainfluenzavirus type 3 in 53.3 per cent, bovine respiratory syncytial virus in 40.0 per cent, bovine adenovirus type 3 in 46.7 per cent, bovine coronavirus in 30.0 per cent, and bovine herpesvirus type 1 in 26.7 per cent. At postmortem examination, Mycoplasma species could be cultured from 61.9 per cent of pneumonic lungs (n=21). Sixty per cent of calves tested were positive for BVDV (n=20), and 20.0 per cent were positive for bovine respiratory syncytial virus (n=16).
TI  - Relationship of in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations of tilmicosin against  Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida and in vivo tilmicosin treatment outcome among calves with signs of bovine respiratory disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine associations between in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tilmicosin against Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida and in vivo tilmicosin treatment outcome among calves with clinical signs of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). DESIGN: Observational, retrospective, cohort study. ANIMALS: 976 feeder calves with clinical signs of BRD enrolled in 16 randomized clinical trials. PROCEDURES: Records of clinical trials from October 26, 1996, to November 15, 2004, were searched to identify calves with BRD from which a single isolate of M haemolytica or P multocida was identified via culture of deep nasal swab samples prior to treatment with tilmicosin (10 mg/kg [4.5 mg/lb], SC) and for which MICs of tilmicosin against the isolate were determined. The MICs of tilmicosin against recovered isolates and response to tilmicosin treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Tilmicosin resistance among M haemolytica and P multocida isolates was uncommon (6/745 [0.8%] and 16/231 [6.9%], respectively). Treatment outcome, defined as success or failure after tilmicosin treatment, did not vary with the MIC of tilmicosin against recovered isolates. The proportion of treatment failures attributed to M haemolytica isolates categorized as resistant (MIC of tilmicosin, >/= 32 mug/mL) or not susceptible (MIC of tilmicosin, >/= 16 mug/mL), was 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Recovery of tilmicosin-resistant M haemolytica or P multocida isolates was rare, and no association was detected between MIC of tilmicosin and treatment response.
TI  - Combinations of macrolide resistance determinants in field isolates of Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Respiratory tract infections in cattle are commonly associated with the bacterial pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. These infections can generally be successfully treated in the field with one of several groups of antibiotics, including macrolides. A few recent isolates of these species exhibit resistance to veterinary macrolides with phenotypes that fall into three distinct classes. The first class has type I macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B antibiotic resistance and, consistent with this, the 23S rRNA nucleotide A2058 is monomethylated by the enzyme product of the erm(42) gene. The second class shows no lincosamide resistance and lacks erm(42) and concomitant 23S rRNA methylation. Sequencing of the genome of a representative strain from this class, P. multocida 3361, revealed macrolide efflux and phosphotransferase genes [respectively termed msr(E) and mph(E)] that are arranged in tandem and presumably expressed from the same promoter. The third class exhibits the most marked drug phenotype, with high resistance to all of the macrolides tested, and possesses all three resistance determinants. The combinations of erm(42), msr(E), and mph(E) are chromosomally encoded and intermingled with other exogenous genes, many of which appear to have been transferred from other members of the Pasteurellaceae. The presence of some of the exogenous genes explains recent reports of resistance to additional drug classes. We have expressed recombinant versions of the erm(42), msr(E), and mph(E) genes within an isogenic Escherichia coli background to assess their individually contributions to resistance. Our findings indicate what types of compounds might have driven the selection for these resistance determinants.
TI  - Investigating the candidacy of lipopolysaccharide-based glycoconjugates as vaccines to combat Mannheimia haemolytica.
AB  - Inner core lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to be conserved in the majority of veterinary strains from the species Mannheimia haemolytica, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida and as such is being considered as a possible vaccine antigen. The proof-in-principle that a LPS-based antigen could be considered as a vaccine candidate has been demonstrated from studies with monoclonal antibodies raised to the inner core LPS of Mannheimia haemolytica, which were shown to be both bactericidal and protective in a mouse model of disease. In this study we confirm and extend the candidacy of the inner core LPS by demonstrating that it is possible to elicit functional antibodies against Mannheimia haemolytica wild-type strains following immunisation of rabbits with glycoconjugates elaborating the conserved inner core LPS antigen. The present study describes a conjugation strategy that uses amidases produced by Dictyostelium discoideum, targeting the amino functionality created by the amidase activity as the attachment point on the LPS molecule. To protect the amino functionality on the phosphoethanolamine (PEtn) residue of the inner core, we developed a novel blocking and unblocking strategy with t-butyl oxycarbonyl. A maleimide-thiol linker strategy with the thiol linker on the carboxyl residues of the carrier protein and the maleimide linker on the carbohydrate resulted in a high loading of carbohydrates per carrier protein. Immunisation derived antisera from rabbits recognised fully extended Mannheimia haemolytica LPS and whole cells from serotypes 1 and 2, despite a somewhat immunodominant response to the linkers also being observed. Moreover, bactericidal activity was demonstrated to a strain elaborating the immunising carbohydrate antigen and crucially to wild-type cells of serotypes 1 and 2, thus further supporting the consideration of inner core LPS as a potential vaccine antigen to combat disease caused by Mannheimia haemolytica.
TI  - Structural analyses of the core oligosaccharide from the lipopolysaccharide of bovine and ovine strains of Mannheimia haemolytica serotype 2.
AB  - Previous structural studies in our laboratory on lipopolysaccharide derived core  oligosaccharide had identified a conserved inner core structure in several strains of the veterinary pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida. In this study we describe the elucidation of the core oligosaccharide structure of two strains from M. haemolytica serotype 2. Structural information was established by a combination of monosaccharide and methylation analyses, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The following structure for the core oligosaccharide was determined on the basis of the combined data from these experiments: [carbohydrate structure: see text]. The structural analyses revealed that the conserved inner core structure was maintained in this serotype, with only the terminal beta-galactose residue of serotype 1 absent.
TI  - Demonstration of the metaphylactic use of gamithromycin against bacterial pathogens associated with bovine respiratory disease in a multicentre farm trial.
AB  - On five commercial cattle rearing sites across Europe, a total of 802 young cattle at high risk of developing bovine respiratory disease (BRD) associated with the bacterial pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica or Pasteurella multocida and/or Mycoplasma bovis were enrolled into a multicentre, controlled field trial. Half were treated with a single dose of gamithromycin at 6 mg/kg bodyweight by subcutaneous injection and half received an injection of a saline placebo as the control. All animals were observed daily for 14 days for signs of BRD as defined by set criteria. The proportion of metaphylactic preventive treatment successes, defined as animals surviving to day 14 without signs of BRD, in the gamithromycin-treated group (86 per cent) was significantly (P=0.0012) higher than in the saline-treated controls (61 per cent). Morbidity among the treated animals was reduced by 64 per cent compared with the controls.
TI  - Crystal structure and immunogenicity of the class C acid phosphatase from Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Pasteurella multocida is a pathogen of veterinary and medical importance. Here, we report the 1.85A resolution crystal structure of the class C acid phosphatase from this organism (denoted rPmCCAP). The structure shows that rPmCCAP exhibits the same haloacid dehalogenase fold and dimeric assembly as the class C enzyme from Haemophilus influenzae. Formation of the dimer in solution is demonstrated using analytical ultracentrifugation. The active site is devoid of a magnesium ion due to the presence of citrate in the crystallization buffer. Absence of the metal ion minimally perturbs the active site structure, which suggests that the main role of the ion is to balance the negative charge of the substrate rather than stabilize the active site structure. The crystal lattice displays unusual crystal packing involving the C-terminal polyhistidine tag mimicking the substrate. Steady-state kinetic constants are determined for the substrates NMN, 5'-AMP, 3'-AMP, 2'-AMP, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The highest catalytic efficiency is observed with NMN. The production of polyclonal anti-rPmCCAP antibodies is demonstrated, and these antibodies are shown to cross-react with the H. influenzae class C phosphatase. The antibodies are used to detect PmCCAP in clinical P. multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica strains cultured from infected animals.
TI  - A novel Erm monomethyltransferase in antibiotic-resistant isolates of Mannheimia  haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida are aetiological agents commonly associated with respiratory tract infections in cattle. Recent isolates of these pathogens have been shown to be resistant to macrolides and other ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Direct analysis of the 23S rRNAs by mass spectrometry revealed that nucleotide A2058 is monomethylated, consistent with a Type I erm phenotype conferring macrolide-lincosamide resistance. The erm resistance determinant was identified by full genome sequencing of isolates. The sequence of this resistance determinant, now termed erm(42), has diverged greatly from all previously characterized erm genes, explaining why it has remained undetected in PCR screening surveys. The sequence of erm(42) is, however, completely conserved in six independent M. haemolytica and P. multocida isolates, suggesting relatively recent gene transfer between these species. Furthermore, the composition of neighbouring chromosomal sequences indicates that erm(42) was acquired from other members of the Pasteurellaceae. Expression of recombinant erm(42) in Escherichia coli demonstrated that the enzyme retains its properties as a monomethyltransferase without any dimethyltransferase activity. Erm(42) is a novel addition to the Erm family: it is phylogenetically distant from the other Erm family members and it is unique in being a bona fide monomethyltransferase that is disseminated between bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Domestic sheep (Ovis aries) Pasteurellaceae isolates from diagnostic submissions  to the Caine Veterinary Teaching Center (1990-2004).
AB  - A retrospective study of Pasteurellaceae isolated from domestic sheep (Ovis aries) was conducted. The aim was to identify Pasteurellaceae present in animals that were clinically healthy and others with evidence of respiratory disease. The bacteria had been isolated from samples submitted to the University of Idaho Caine Veterinary Teaching Center as part of disease diagnostic testing. The 844 isolates identified mainly three species of Pasteurellaceae: Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Pasteurella (Bibersteinia) trehalosi. A total of 114 biovariants were identified among these three species. Individual biovariants were identified 1-180 times. Two of those (M. haemolytica 1 and P. (B.) trehalosi 2) constituted 36% of the isolates, and were the only biovariants sufficiently numerous to account for >7% of the total isolates. Samples were primarily submitted from sheep with signs of respiratory disease. Eighty percent of biovariants were identified most often in animals with signs of respiratory disease, but 26% of biovariants were isolated from both sheep with respiratory disease and apparently healthy sheep. P. multocida constituted 4.7% of isolates, and were exclusively associated with animals with respiratory disease. The ability of isolates to produce beta-hemolysis on culture media was not associated with animals with respiratory disease (odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.50-1.19). The inference of this study is limited due to the retrospective study design. However, it is the first study that provides an extensive baseline list of biovariants associated with respiratory disease in domestic sheep.
TI  - A bighorn sheep die-off in southern Colorado involving a Pasteurellaceae strain that may have originated from syntopic cattle.
AB  - We investigated a pasteurellosis epizootic in free-ranging bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) wherein a Pasteurellaceae strain carried by syntopic cattle (Bos taurus) under severe winter conditions appeared to contribute to pneumonia in affected bighorns. Twenty-one moribund or dead bighorn sheep were found on the "Fossil Ridge" herd's winter range, Colorado, USA, between 13 December 2007 and 29 February 2008. Eight carcasses examined showed gross or microscopic evidence of acute to subacute fibrinous bronchopneumonia. All eight carcasses yielded at least one beta-hemolytic Mannheimia haemolytica biogroup 1(+/-(G)) strain, and seven also yielded a beta-hemolytic Bibersteinia trehalosi biogroup 4 (CDS) strain; evidence of Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, and parainfluenza 3 and bovine respiratory syncytial viruses was also detected. Isolates of beta-hemolytic Manneimia haemolytica biogroup 1(G) from a bighorn carcass and a syntopic cow showed 99.5% similarity in genetic fingerprints; B. trehalosi biogroup 4(CDS) isolates were >/=94.9% similar to an isolate from a nearby bighorn herd. Field and laboratory observations suggested that pneumonia in affected bighorns may have been caused by a combination of pathogens including two pathogenic Pasteurellaceae strains--one likely of cattle origin and one likely of bighorn origin--with infections in some cases perhaps exacerbated by other respiratory pathogens and severe weather conditions. Our and others' findings suggest that intimate interactions between wild sheep and cattle should be discouraged as part of a comprehensive approach to health management and conservation of North American wild sheep species.
TI  - The synthesis of paleic acid, an antimicrobial agent effective against Mannheimia and Pasteurella, and its structurally related derivatives.
AB  - A synthetic route to paleic acid 1, antimicrobial agent effective against Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida, has been established. The absolute configuration of the secondary hydroxyl group was controlled by a catalytic asymmetric alkylation of an aldehyde using a chiral titanium sulfonamide complex and the cis double bond was installed using a Wittig reaction. This synthetic route was also applied to the preparation of structurally related analogs, which were used in structure-activity relationship studies for antibacterial activity.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens of the bovine respiratory disease complex.
AB  - Pneumonia caused by the bacterial pathogens discussed in this article is the most significant cause of morbidity and mortality of the BRDC. Most of these infectious bacteria are not capable of inducing significant disease without the presence of other predisposing environmental factors, physiologic stressors, or concurrent infections. Mannheimia haemolytica is the most common and serious of these bacterial agents and is therefore also the most highly characterized. There are other important bacterial pathogens of BRD, such as Pasteurella multocida, Histophulus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis. Mixed infections with these organisms do occur. These pathogens have unique and common virulence factors but the resulting pneumonic lesions may be similar. Although the amount and quality of research associated with BRD has increased, vaccination and therapeutic practices are not fully successful. A greater understanding of the virulence mechanisms of the infecting bacteria and pathogenesis of pneumonia, as well as the characteristics of the organisms that allow tissue persistence, may lead to improved management, therapeutics, and vaccines.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of amoxicillin against Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) correlation in sheep.
AB  - Silicone-made tissue cages were implanted in sheep. Blood serum (SBS) and tissue  cage fluid (TCF) samples were collected after amoxicillin intravenous and intramuscular administrations, at the dose of 15 mg/kg. Amoxicillin pharmacodynamics were studied in an artificial culture medium, SBS and TCF with use of a Mannheimia haemolytica and a Pasteurella multocida strain. A concentration-independent antimicrobial activity of amoxicillin was confirmed for levels higher than 0.79-1.75xMIC. This result favored the use of the percentage of the 24 h dosing interval during which drug levels remain above MIC as the appropriate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index. The subsequent correlation revealed that intravenous administration could be considered effective against "deep" infections caused by bacteria with MICs<1 mug/mL or "shallow" infections caused by bacteria with MICs<0.1 mug/mL. Intramuscular administration could be safely considered effective against both "deep" and "shallow" infections when the MICs of the targeted pathogens are lower than 1 mug/mL.
TI  - Molecular classification and its impact on diagnostics and understanding the phylogeny and epidemiology of selected members of Pasteurellaceae of veterinary importance.
AB  - In this paper we briefly report recent taxonomic changes that have taken place within the bacterial family Pasteurellaceae as a result of molecular investigations. We address the complexity and diagnostic possibilities and outline the current knowledge on the population structure these investigations have generated. In addition, we discuss future possibilities to improve basic understanding of genetic diversity at population level, possible host adaptation and stability of clones associated with disease outbreaks. All taxa of Pasteurellaceae have been characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the 16S rRNA gene sequence has been the starting point for classification and identification of most taxa, including PCR detection methods developed. Generally, it is preferred to isolate and store the bacterium before characterization is carried out, however, if this is impossible, a PCR test can be carried out on DNA extracted from suspected material. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is a possibility for only a few members of Pasteurellaceae. Identification based on the partial rpoB sequence is possible when a high simililarity to a sequence of a well known reference strain is found. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is only available for a few taxa of Pasteurellaceae of veterinary importance including [Haemophilus] parosuis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Application of this method for characterization of broad strain collections has improved our knowledge on population level significantly, and added to our understanding of disease manifestations. Current improvements in progress focus on sequence based identification at the population level reflecting that disease and persistence, host associations and host response are expressed at the clonal population level rather than at the species level.
TI  - Bovine pasteurellosis and other bacterial infections of the respiratory tract.
AB  - Despite technological, biologic, and pharmacologic advances the bacterial component of the bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex continues to have a major adverse effect on the health and wellbeing of stocker and feeder cattle. Overlooked in this disappointing assessment is evaluation of the effects that working with younger, lighter-weight cattle have on managing the bacterial component of the BRD complex. Most problems associated with BRD come from cattle taken from and comingled with cattle operations that have inconsistent or nonexistent cattle health management. This article reviews the biologic, clinical, and management aspects of Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis, primarily as related to current production management considerations of stocker and feeder cattle.
TI  - Bibersteinia trehalosi inhibits the growth of Mannheimia haemolytica by a proximity-dependent mechanism.
AB  - Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica is the only pathogen that consistently causes severe bronchopneumonia and rapid death of bighorn sheep (BHS; Ovis canadensis) under experimental conditions. Paradoxically, Bibersteinia (Pasteurella) trehalosi and Pasteurella multocida have been isolated from BHS pneumonic lungs much more frequently than M. haemolytica. These observations suggest that there may be an interaction between these bacteria, and we hypothesized that B. trehalosi overgrows or otherwise inhibits the growth of M. haemolytica. Growth curves (monoculture) demonstrated that B. trehalosi has a shorter doubling time ( approximately 10 min versus approximately 27 min) and consistently achieves 3-log higher cell density (CFU/ml) compared to M. haemolytica. During coculture M. haemolytica growth was inhibited when B. trehalosi entered stationary phase (6 h) resulting in a final cell density for M. haemolytica that was 6 to 9 logs lower than expected with growth in the absence of B. trehalosi. Coculture supernatant failed to inhibit M. haemolytica growth on agar or in broth, indicating no obvious involvement of lytic phages, bacteriocins, or quorum-sensing systems. This observation was confirmed by limited growth inhibition of M. haemolytica when both pathogens were cultured in the same media but separated by a filter (0.4-microm pore size) that limited contact between the two bacterial populations. There was significant growth inhibition of M. haemolytica when the populations were separated by membranes with a pore size of 8 mum that allowed free contact. These observations demonstrate that B. trehalosi can both outgrow and inhibit M. haemolytica growth with the latter related to a proximity- or contact-dependent mechanism.
TI  - Update on bacterial pathogenesis in BRD.
AB  - Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis and Arcanobacterium pyogenes are all frequently implicated in bovine respiratory disease (BRD). M. haemolytica is considered the most important of the group. These bacteria are commensals in the nasopharynx and establish infection in the lungs of cattle that are subjected to a variety of stresses. Factors that permit adherence to and proliferation in the lungs and factors that cause tissue destruction and inflammation have been identified as having major roles in pathogenesis. These virulence factors include protein adhesins, capsular polysaccharide, outer membrane proteins, iron-binding proteins, lipopolysacharide or lipooligosaccharide, enzymes and toxins. These bacterial products function to evade the immune system, damage the immune system and induce a severe inflammatory response.
TI  - Bovine respiratory disease research (1983-2009).
AB  - Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) research has provided significant understanding  of the disease over the past 26 years. Modern research tools that have been used include monoclonal antibodies, genomics, polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry (IHC), DNA vaccines and viral vectors coding for immunogens. Emerging/reemerging viruses and new antigenic strains of viruses and bacteria have been identified. Methods of detection and the role for cattle persistently infected bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) were identified; viral subunits, cellular components and bacterial products have been characterized. Product advances have included vaccines for bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida; the addition of BVDV2 to the existing vaccines and new antibiotics. The role of Mycoplasma spp., particularly Mycoplasma bovis in BRD, has been more extensively studied. Bovine immunology research has provided more specific information on immune responses, T cell subsets and cytokines. The molecular and genetic basis for viral-bacterial synergy in BRD has been described. Attempts have been made to document how prevention of BRD by proper vaccination and management prior to exposure to infectious agents can minimize disease and serve as economic incentives for certified health programs.
TI  - New plasmid tools for genetic analysis of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other pasteurellaceae.
AB  - We have generated a set of plasmids, based on the mobilizable shuttle vector pMIDG100, which can be used as tools for genetic manipulation of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other members of the Pasteurellaceae. A tandem reporter plasmid, pMC-Tandem, carrying promoterless xylE and gfpmut3 genes downstream of a multiple-cloning site (MCS), can be used for identification of transcriptional regulators and conditions which favor gene expression from different cloned promoters. The ability to detect transcriptional regulators using the tandem reporter system was validated in A. pleuropneumoniae using the cloned rpoE (sigma(E)) promoter (P). The resulting plasmid, pMCrpoEP, was used to identify a mutant defective in production of RseA, the negative regulator of sigma(E), among a bank of random transposon mutants, as well as to detect induction of sigma(E) following exposure of A. pleuropneumoniae to ethanol or heat shock. pMCsodCP, carrying the cloned sodC promoter of A. pleuropneumoniae, was functional in A. pleuropneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parasuis, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida. Two general expression vectors, pMK-Express and pMC-Express, which differ in their antibiotic resistance markers (kanamycin and chloramphenicol, respectively), were constructed for the Pasteurellaceae. Both plasmids have the A. pleuropneumoniae sodC promoter upstream of the gfpmut3 gene and an extended MCS. Replacement of gfpmut3 with a gene of interest allows complementation and heterologous gene expression, as evidenced by expression of the Haemophilus ducreyi nadV gene in A. pleuropneumoniae, rendering the latter NAD independent.
TI  - Atypical non-progressive pneumonia in goats.
AB  - An outbreak of severe respiratory disease in a goat herd was associated with Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, Mycoplasma arginini, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida with mortality rates exceeding 20% in kids. Post mortem features in affected kids included severe pleuropneumonia, lung consolidation, large quantities of pleural fluid and pericarditis. This is the first report of atypical proliferative pneumonia in goats in Portugal.
TI  - Lung pathology and infectious agents in fatal feedlot pneumonias and relationship with mortality, disease onset, and treatments.
AB  - This study charted 237 fatal cases of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) observed from May 2002 to May 2003 in a single Oklahoma feed yard. Postmortem lung samples were used for agent identification and histopathology. Late in the study, 94 skin samples (ear notches) were tested for Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Bovine respiratory disease morbidity was 14.7%, and the mortality rate of all causes was 1.3%, with more than half (53.8%) attributed to BRD (0.7% total of all causes). The agents isolated were the following: Mannheimia haemolytica (25.0%), Pasteurella multocida (24.5%), Histophilus somni (10.0%), Arcanobacterium pyogenes (35.0%), Salmonella spp. (0.5%), and Mycoplasma spp. (71.4%). Viruses recovered by cell culture were BVDV-1a noncytopathic (NCP; 2.7%), BVDV-1a cytopathic (CP) vaccine strain (1.8%), BVDV-1b NCP (2.7%), BVDV-2a NCP (3.2%), BVDV-2b CP (0.5%), and Bovine herpesvirus 1 (2.3%). Gel-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were 4.6% positive for Bovine respiratory syncytial virus and 10.8% positive for Bovine coronavirus. Bovine viral diarrhea virus IHC testing was positive in 5.3% of the animals. The mean values were determined for the treatment data: fatal disease onset (32.65 days), treatment interval (29.15 days), number of antibiotic treatments (2.65), number of different antibiotics (1.89), and day of death (61.81 days). Lesions included the following: 1) duration: acute (21%), subacute (15%), chronic (40.2%), healing (2.8%), normal (18.1%), and autolyzed (2.8%); 2) type of pneumonia: lobar bronchopneumonia (LBP; 27.1%), LBP with pleuritis (49.1%), interstitial pneumonia (5.1%), bronchointerstitial pneumonia (1.4%), septic (0.9%), embolic foci (0.5%), other (2.8%), normal (10.3%), and autolyzed (2.8%); and 3) bronchiolar lesions: bronchiolitis obliterans (39.7%), bronchiolar necrosis (26.6%), bronchiolitis obliterans/bronchiolar necrosis (1.4%), other bronchiolar lesions (6.5%), and bronchiolar lesion negative (25.7%). Statistically significant relationships were present among the agents, lesions, and the animal treatment, disease onset, and mortality data. Clinical illnesses observed in this study were lengthier than those reported 16-20 years ago, based on fatal disease onset, treatment interval, and day of death.
TI  - [Fatty acid composition of cells and lipopolysaccliarides of Mannheimia haemolytica, Mannheimia glucosida and Bibersteinia trehalosi strains].
AB  - The Mannheimia haemolytica, Mannheimia glucosida and Bibersteinia trehalosi strains and the similar fatty acid composition of cells with domination of C(16:1) and C(16:0), which were in almost equal quantities, C(14:0 and C(18:1) + C(18:2). The fatty acid composition of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of the studied bacteria had no essential differences too. It was mainly represented by C(14:0) and 3-OH-C(14:0) which consisted of more than 80% of all LPS fatty acids. C(12:0), C(16:1) and C(16:0) were presented in LPS in small quantities. The M. haemolytica, M. glucosida and B. trehalosi strains did not differ essentially by fatty acid compositions of cells and LPS from earlier studied strains of genera Pasteurella (P. multocida), Haemophilus (H. influenzae and other species), Actinobacillus (A. pleuropneumoniae). This shows the close phylogenetic relationship of the mentioned bacteria and significance of investigated signs as chemotaxonomic markers for differentiation of taxons of the above genus level. The paper is presented in Russian.
TI  - Respiratory disease in calves: microbiological investigations on trans-tracheally aspirated bronchoalveolar fluid and acute phase protein response.
AB  - Trans-tracheal aspirations from 56 apparently healthy calves and 34 calves with clinical signs of pneumonia were collected in six different herds during September and November 2002. The 90 samples were cultivated and investigated by PCR tests targeting the species Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, Mycoplasma dispar, and Mycoplasma bovirhinis. A PCR test amplifying the lktC-artJ intergenic region was evaluated and shown to be specific for the two species M. haemolytica and Mannheimia glucosida. All 90 aspirations were also analyzed for bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza-3 virus, and bovine corona virus by antigen ELISA. Surprisingly, 63% of the apparently healthy calves harbored potentially pathogenic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract, 60% of these samples contained either pure cultures or many pathogenic bacteria in mixed culture. Among diseased calves, all samples showed growth of pathogenic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract. All of these were classified as pure culture or many pathogenic bacteria in mixed culture. A higher percentage of the samples were positive for all bacterial species in the group of diseased animals compared to the clinically healthy animals, however this difference was only significant for M. dispar and M. bovirhinis. M. bovis was not detected in any of the samples. BRSV was detected in diseased calves in two herds but not in the clinically healthy animals. Among the diseased calves in these two herds a significant increase in haptoglobin and serum amyloid A levels was observed compared to the healthy calves. The results indicate that haptoglobin might be the best choice for detecting disease under field conditions. For H. somni and M. haemolytica, a higher percentage of the samples were found positive by PCR than by cultivation, whereas the opposite result was found for P. multocida. Detection of P. multocida by PCR or cultivation was found to be significantly associated with the disease status of the calves. For H. somni a similar association with disease status was only observed for cultivation and not for PCR.
TI  - In vitro activities of tulathromycin and ceftiofur combined with other antimicrobial agents using bovine Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica isolates.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the activities of two antibacterial agents used in the treatment of bovine respiratory infections-tulathromycin, a macrolide, and ceftiofur, a third-generation cephalosporin-alone, in combination with each other, and in combination with each of seven additional antibiotics (tilmicosin, florfenicol, enrofloxacin, danofloxacin, ampicillin, tetracycline, and penicillin G) against bovine Pasteurella multocida (n = 60) and Mannheimia haemolytica (n = 10) isolates for determination of synergy, antagonism, or indifference. Of 458 organism-drug combinations, 160 combinations of tulathromycin and 209 combinations of ceftiofur with eight antimicrobial drugs were indifferent. One combination was antagonistic (ceftiofur + florfenicol against one isolate of P. multocida). Time-kill studies showed loss of cidality for ceftiofur when combined with florfenicol at 1x the minimal inhibitory concentration. Overall, the in vitro data demonstrated that tulathromycin and ceftiofur, in combination with each other or seven other antimicrobial agents, primarily produce an indifferent response with no occurrences of synergism and rare occurrences of antagonism.
TI  - Safety and efficacy testing of a novel multivalent bovine bacterial respiratory vaccine composed of five bacterins and two immunogens.
AB  - Bovine bacterial respiratory diseases have been one of the most serious problems  due to their high mortality and economic loss in calves. The vaccinations of bovine bacterial respiratory vaccines have been complex because of no multivalent vaccine. In this study, novel multivalent bovine bacterial respiratory vaccine (BRV) was developed and tested for its safety and efficacy. BRV was composed of two immunogens and five bacterins. These were leukotoxoid and bacterin of Mannheimia haemolytica type A, outer membrane protein and bacterin of Pasteurella multocida type A, and bacterins of Haemophilus somnus, Mycoplasma bovis, and Arcanobacterium pyogenes. ELISA antibody titers to five bacterial antigens in vaccinated guinea pigs increased, compared with those in unvaccinated ones. BRV was safe for calves and pregnant cattle in this study. In calves challenged with M. haemolytica and P. multocida, the average daily weight gain and antibody titers of vaccinated calves increased, and respiratory symptoms (P<0.05) and treatment frequency (P<0.01) of vaccinated calves significantly decreased, compared with those of unvaccinated calves. Interestingly, the antibody titers of M. haemolytica leukotoxoid and Mycoplasma bovis were closely related with the reduction of respiratory symptoms. BRV would be an ecomonical measure for the protection against bovine bacterial respiratory diseases.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle in different European countries: 2002-2004.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The project "Antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal origin - II" (ARBAO-II) was funded by the European Union (FAIR5-QLK2-2002-01146) for the period 2003-2005, with the aim to establish a continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility among veterinary laboratories in European countries based on validated and harmonised methodologies. Available summary data of the susceptibility testing of the bacterial pathogens from the different laboratories were collected. METHOD: Antimicrobial susceptibility data for several bovine pathogens were obtained over a three year period (2002-2004). Each year the participating laboratories were requested to fill in excel-file templates with national summary data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance from different bacterial species.A proficiency test (EQAS - external quality assurance system) for antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted each year to test the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the participating laboratories. The data from this testing demonstrated that for the species included in the EQAS the results are comparable between countries. RESULTS: Data from 25,241 isolates were collected from 13 European countries. For Staphylococcus aureus from bovine mastitis major differences were apparent in the occurrence of resistance between countries and between the different antimicrobial agents tested. The highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin. For Mannheimia haemolytica resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphonamide were observed in France, the Netherlands and Portugal. All isolates of Pasteurella multocida isolated in Finland and most of those from Denmark, England (and Wales), Italy and Sweden were susceptible to the majority of the antimicrobials. Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis isolates from Sweden were fully susceptible. For the other countries some resistance was observed to tetracycline, gentamicin and erythromycin. More resistance and variation of the resistance levels between countries were observed for Escherichia coli compared to the other bacterial species investigated. CONCLUSION: In general, isolates from Denmark, England (and Wales), the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland showed low frequencies of resistance, whereas many isolates from Belgium, France, Italy, Latvia and Spain were resistant to most antimicrobials tested. In the future, data on the prevalence of resistance should be used to develop guidelines for appropriate antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine.
TI  - Effect of age at the time of vaccination on antibody titers and feedlot performance in beef calves.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare antibody responses, feedlot morbidity and mortality rates,  feedlot performance, and carcass value for calves vaccinated with 1 of 2 vaccination strategies and for unvaccinated control calves. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. ANIMALS: 451 beef steers and heifers. PROCEDURES: Calves were vaccinated with a modified-live infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 (BVDV1) and 2 (BVDV2), parainfluenza type 3 virus, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus vaccine and Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida bacterin-toxoid at approximately 67 and 190 days of age (group 1; n = 151) or at approximately 167 and 190 days of age (group 2; 150) or were not vaccinated (control; 150). Serum antibody titers were measured at approximately 2, 67, 167, 190, and 232 days of age. Morbidity and mortality rates, feedlot performance, and carcass value were recorded for 361 calves shipped to feedlots. RESULTS: Percentages of calves seroconverting to IBRV, BVDV1, and BVDV2 were significantly higher for groups 1 and 2 than for the control group. Mean treatment costs were significantly lower for vaccinated than for control calves, and mean mortality rate was significantly higher for control calves than for group 1 calves. Feedlot performance and carcass value did not vary significantly among groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that vaccination of beef calves with a 5-antigen modified-live virus vaccine at 67 and 190 days of age was as effective in terms of immunologic responses as was vaccination at 167 and 190 days of age.
TI  - Effects of commingling beef calves from different sources and weaning protocols during a forty-two-day receiving period on performance and bovine respiratory disease.
AB  - The study objective was to determine health and performance of ranch calves from  different preconditioning strategies during a 42-d receiving period when commingled with calves of unknown health histories from multiple sources. Steer calves from a single source ranch (RANCH) were weaned and immediately shipped to a feedlot (WEAN, initial BW = 247 +/- 29 kg); weaned on the ranch for 45 d before shipping, but did not receive any vaccinations (WEAN45, initial BW = 231 +/- 26 kg); or weaned, vaccinated with modified live viral vaccine, and held on the ranch for 45 d before shipping (WEANVAC45, initial BW = 274 +/- 21 kg). Multiple-source steers were purchased through auction markets (MARKET, initial BW = 238 +/- 13 kg), and upon receiving, a portion of ranch-origin steers from each weaning group was commingled with a portion of MARKET cattle (COMM). The experimental design was completely randomized with a 2 x 3 +1 factorial arrangement of treatments. Factors were RANCH vs. COMM and weaning management (WEAN vs. WEAN45 vs. WEANVAC45) as the factors; MARKET cattle served as the control. Calves of WEAN, WEAN45, and MARKET were vaccinated on arrival at the feedlot. Ranch-origin calves tended (P = 0.06) to have greater ADG than COMM or MARKET calves, although ADG was not affected (P = 0.46) by weaning management. Across the 42-d receiving period, DMI was not affected (P = 0.85) by cattle origin. However, MARKET, WEAN45, and WEANVAC45 calves consumed more (P < 0.001) DM than WEAN calves. Gain efficiency was not affected (P > or = 0.11) by treatment. Ranch-origin calves were less (P < 0.001) likely to be treated for bovine respiratory disease than MARKET calves; COMM calves were intermediate. Calves that were retained on the ranch after weaning (WEAN45 and WEANVAC45) were also less likely to be treated (P = 0.001) than MARKET or WEAN calves. As expected, differences in morbidity related to differences in health costs. Calves of WEAN45 and WEANVAC45 had less (P < 0.001) health costs than MARKET and WEAN calves. On arrival, serum haptoglobin concentrations were greater (P < 0.001) in MARKET and WEAN compared with WEAN45 and WEANVAC45 calves. Calves from a single source that are retained on the ranch for 45 d after weaning exhibit less morbidity and less health costs during the receiving period at the feedyard than when cattle are commingled or trucked to the feedyard immediately after weaning.
TI  - A comparison of 2 vaccination programs in feedlot calves at ultra-high risk of developing undifferentiated fever/bovine respiratory disease.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare 2 vaccination programs in feedlot calves at  ultra-high risk of developing undifferentiated fever (UF)/bovine respiratory disease (BRD). At feedlot arrival, 3882 calves were enrolled in the study and randomly allocated to 2 groups, which were housed by group in 12 pens. At the time of allocation, 1 group (MLV3-BT2) received a multivalent, modified-live viral vaccine containing infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV) and types I and II bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), as well as a Mannheimia haemolytica (MH) and Pasteurella multocida bacterin-toxoid. The other group (MLV4-BT1) received a vaccine containing IIBRV, type I BVDV, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza-3 virus, as well as a MH bacterin-toxoid. At an average of 69 days post arrival, the groups received their respective viral vaccines. The initial UF treatment, overall chronicity, overall wastage, overall mortality, and BRD mortality rates were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the MLV3-BT2 group than in the MLV4-BT1 group. Average daily gain and the proportions of yield grade Canada 3 and quality grade E carcasses were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the MLV3-BT2 group than in the MLV4-BT1 group. No significant (P > or = 0.05) difference in the dry matter intake to gain ratio was detected between the 2 groups. In economic terms, there was a net advantage of $20.86 CDN/animal in the MLV3-BT2 group. This study demonstrates that it is more cost effective to use an MLV3-BT2 vaccination program than a MLV4-BT1 vaccination program in feedlot calves at ultra-high risk of developing UF/BRD.
TI  - Immune evasion by pathogens of bovine respiratory disease complex.
AB  - Bovine respiratory tract disease is a multi-factorial disease complex involving several viruses and bacteria. Viruses that play prominent roles in causing the bovine respiratory disease complex include bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus and parinfluenza-3 virus. Bacteria that play prominent roles in this disease complex are Mannheimia haemolytica and Mycoplasma bovis. Other bacteria that infect the bovine respiratory tract of cattle are Histophilus (Haemophilus) somni and Pasteurella multocida. Frequently, severe respiratory tract disease in cattle is associated with concurrent infections of these pathogens. Like other pathogens, the viral and bacterial pathogens of this disease complex have co-evolved with their hosts over millions of years. As much as the hosts have diversified and fine-tuned the components of their immune system, the pathogens have also evolved diverse and sophisticated strategies to evade the host immune responses. These pathogens have developed intricate mechanisms to thwart both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune responses of their hosts. This review presents an overview of the strategies by which the pathogens suppress host immune responses, as well as the strategies by which the pathogens modify themselves or their locations in the host to evade host immune responses. These immune evasion strategies likely contribute to the failure of currently-available vaccines to provide complete protection to cattle against these pathogens.
TI  - Susceptibility testing of tulathromycin: interpretative breakpoints and susceptibility of field isolates.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility tests were conducted on bovine and porcine respiratory pathogens isolated from European countries during 2004-2006 for susceptibility to tulathromycin using the recommended methodologies for broth microdilution. The results were compared with data from a similar survey conducted prior to launch in 1998-2001 to monitor for any shift in susceptibility. The importance of maintaining the pH of the culture media within the range 7.2-7.4 was re-affirmed as a key factor in obtaining consistent minimum inhibitory concentration data. The use of recently established interpretative breakpoints would indicate that to date there has been no apparent decrease in susceptibility to tulathromycin since it became widely used across Europe.
TI  - Accuracy of susceptibility testing of Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica.
AB  - The accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility determinations relies on the bacterial species identification and the test methodology that is being used. In the present study, both aspects were investigated for 141 Pasteurella multocida and 34 Mannheimia haemolytica sensu lato isolates recovered from the upper respiratory tract of healthy calves. This was performed on the one hand by comparing of classical phenotyping with tDNA-PCR genotyping and on the other hand by pairwise comparison of disk diffusion with agar dilution results for seven antimicrobial compounds (ampicillin, ceftiofur, oxytetracycline, gentamicin, florfenicol, enrofloxacin, and the combination trimethoprim-sulfonamides). Phenotyping and genotyping correlated well (>90%). The pairwise comparisons of the susceptibility methods were investigated traditionally by means of error binding rates and sensitivity and specificity test characteristics. Obtained sensitivities (indication for absence of false susceptible results) were often lower than 85%, especially for older antimicrobial agents (oxytetracycline, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfonamides) and when M. haemolytica sensu lato was considered. Specificities (indication for absence of false-resistant results) exceeded 90% for almost all antimicrobial-bacterial combinations. The calculated test characteristics (sensitivities and specificities) were subsequently used in a second dataset of Pasteurellaceae from intensively (n = 99) and extensively housed calves (n = 196), to modify the apparent prevalence of antimicrobial resistance based upon disk diffusion results into an estimated true prevalence. It was concluded that the disk diffusion method is reliable in epidemiological studies like surveillance programs if resistance is sparse, whereas it needs to be interpreted with caution in situations where resistance is abundantly present.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial pathogens against lincomycin/spectinomycin (1/2), penicillin G/neomycin (1/1), and penicillin G/dihydrostreptomycin (1/1) as determined in the BfT-GermVet monitoring program 2004-2006.
AB  - A total of 368 bacterial pathogens, including 72 coagulase-positive and coagulase-variable staphylococci, 97 beta-haemolytic streptococci, 51 Escherichia coli, 75 Pasteurella multocida, 25 Mannheimia haemolytica, 25 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 23 Arcanobacterium pyogenes, were investigated for their susceptibility to the three combinations of antimicrobial agents lincomycin/spectinomycin (1/2), penicillin G/neomycin (1/1), and penicillin G/dihydrostreptomycin (1/1) in comparison to their susceptibility to the corresponding single substances. When comparing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined for any of the three combinations with those for the single substances, the lowest MIC of one of the two substances usually determined the MIC of the combination.This observation was made for all three combinations and all bacterial pathogens tested.Thus, it is assumed that the combination of lincomycin with spectinomycin as well as that of penicillin with either neomycin or dihydrostreptomycin resulted in an extended spectrum of target bacterial pathogens rather than in an increase in antimicrobial efficacy.
TI  - The response of Mannheimia haemolytica to iron limitation: implications for the acquisition of iron in the bovine lung.
AB  - Mannheimia haemolytica is the major causative agent of shipping fever, a severe pneumonia in cattle causing high morbidity and mortality. A prerequisite of successful lung colonization by M. haemolytica is the necessity to adapt to the paucity of iron. The lack of genome information has precluded an assessment of the genetic repertoire available to M. haemolytica to adapt to low iron environments. To close this knowledge-gap, we have determined 90% of a virulent M. haemolytica serotype A1 genome sequence and produced a microarray in order to study gene expression under iron-limiting growth for 15, 30 and 60 min. M. haemolytica responded to iron limitation by the up-regulation of transcripts coding for receptors and ABC-type transporters of transferrin, haemoglobin, haem and siderophores. Real time PCR analysis of lung tissue from Mannheimia-infected calves demonstrated the in vivo transcription of two potential haemoglobin receptors, hmbR1 and hmbR2. The relative hmbR1 and hmbR2 transcript levels in the infected lung tissue were comparable to the induced levels observed under iron-limiting growth, demonstrating in vivo induction of receptor transcription in the context of an infection. When the iron response of M. haemolytica was compared to the iron response of Pasteurella multocida, another pathogen colonizing the bovine lung, only few homologous genes were induced in both organisms. These included the haemoglobin receptor hmbR2 and the periplasmic transport systems yfeABCD and fbpABC. The comparative analysis suggests that the two pathogens use different strategies to adapt to the iron-limiting environment in the bovine host.
TI  - Etiology of respiratory disease in non-vaccinated, non-medicated calves in rearing herds.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the occurrence of bacterial, mycoplasmal and viral pathogens in the lower respiratory tract of calves in all-in all-out calf-rearing units. According to clinical status, non-medicated calves with and without respiratory disease signs were selected of the 40 herds investigated to analyse the micro-organisms present in healthy and diseased calves. Tracheobronchial lavage (TBL) and paired serum samples were analysed for bacteria, mycoplasmas, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), bovine corona virus (BCV) and bovine adenovirus (BAV). Pasteurella multocida was the most common bacterial pathogen. It was isolated from 34% of the TBL samples in 28 herds and was associated with clinical respiratory disease (p < 0.05) when other pathogenic bacteria or mycoplasma were present in the sample. Mannheimia spp. and Histophilus somni were rarely found. Mycoplasma bovis was not detected at all. Ureaplasma diversum was associated with clinical respiratory disease (p < 0.05). TBL samples from healthy or suspect calves were more often negative in bacterial culture than samples from diseased calves (p < 0.05). No viral infections were detected in six herds, while 16-21 herds had RSV, BCV, BAV or PIV3. In the herds that had calves seroconverted to BCV, respiratory shedding of BCV was more frequently observed than faecal shedding. This study showed that the microbial combinations behind BRD were diverse between herds. M. bovis, an emerging pathogen in many countries, was not detected.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of respiratory tract pathogens from sheep and goats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of common respiratory tract pathogens from sheep and goats. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SAMPLE POPULATION: 41 respiratory tract isolates from sheep and 36 isolates from goats. PROCEDURES: Disk diffusion assay was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, ciprofloxacin, florfenicol, and tetracycline. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of florfenicol for these isolates were determined by use of the microbroth dilution technique. RESULTS: The most common isolates were Pasteurella multocida (n = 28) and Mannheimia haemolytica (39). All isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, ciprofloxacin, and florfenicol. Five percent (4/77) of isolates were resistant to tetracycline. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens isolated from sheep and goats to commonly used antimicrobial drugs in this study was high. Treatment of these species for bacterial respiratory tract disease is likely not complicated by antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Evolution of competence and DNA uptake specificity in the Pasteurellaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many bacteria can take up DNA, but the evolutionary history and function of natural competence and transformation remain obscure. The sporadic distribution of competence suggests it is frequently lost and/or gained, but this has not been examined in an explicitly phylogenetic context. Additional insight may come from the sequence specificity of uptake by species such as Haemophilus influenzae, where a 9 bp uptake signal sequence (USS) repeat is both highly overrepresented in the genome and needed for efficient DNA uptake. We used the distribution of competence genes and DNA uptake specificity in H. influenzae's family, the Pasteurellaceae, to examine the ancestry of competence. RESULTS: A phylogeny of the Pasteurellaceae based on 12 protein coding genes from species with sequenced genomes shows two strongly supported subclades: the Hin subclade (H. influenzae, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia succiniciproducens, and H. somnus), and the Apl subclade (A. pleuropneumoniae, M. haemolytica, and H. ducreyi). All species contained homologues of all known H. influenzae competence genes, consistent with an ancestral origin of competence. Competence gene defects were identified in three species (H. somnus, H. ducreyi and M. haemolytica); each appeared to be of recent origin. The assumption that USS arise by mutation rather than copying was first confirmed using alignments of H. influenzae proteins with distant homologues. Abundant USS-like repeats were found in all eight Pasteurellacean genomes; the repeat consensuses of species in the Hin subclade were identical to that of H. influenzae (AAGTGCGGT), whereas members of the Apl subclade shared the consensus ACAAGCGGT. All species' USSs had the strong consensus and flanking AT-rich repeats of H. influenzae USSs. DNA uptake and competition experiments demonstrated that the Apl-type repeat is a true USS distinct from the Hin-type USS: A. pleuropneumoniae preferentially takes up DNA fragments containing the Apl-type USS over both H. influenzae and unrelated DNAs, and H. influenzae prefers its own USS over the Apl type. CONCLUSION: Competence and DNA uptake specificity are ancestral properties of the Pasteurellaceae, with divergent USSs and uptake specificity distinguishing only the two major subclades. The conservation of most competence genes over the approximately 350 million year history of the family suggests that lineages that lose competence may be evolutionary dead ends.
TI  - Detection of tetracycline-resistant and susceptible pasteurellaceae in the nasopharynx of loose group-housed calves.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine which Pasteurella and Mannheimia species are present in the upper respiratory tract of healthy calves with no history of antimicrobial treatment prior to sampling. The presence of subpopulations of tetracycline-resistant Pasteurellaceae was also investigated. Nasal swabs from 61 loose group-housed, clinically healthy calves, 1 to 4 months old, from 16 dairy herds were inoculated aerobically on a selective medium (Columbia agar with 5% ovine blood and 16 mg/L bacitracin) with or without 4 mg/L oxytetracycline (OTC). A total of 43 strains belonging to the family Pasteurellaceae were isolated from 38 calves (62.3%) out of 13 herds (81.3%). The predominant organisms were Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida (57.4%), Mannheimia varigena (4.9%) and M. haemolytica (3.2%). Growth of Pasteurellaceae on the OTC-containing medium was seen only with samples from two herds (6 animals; 9.8%), and on only one farm this proved to be an OTC-resistant subpopulation. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations by means of agar dilution confirmed a low prevalence of OTC-resistant Pasteurellaceae, with overall MIC(50) and MIC(90) values of 0.25 and 32 mg/L, respectively. These data do not support the hypothesis that the relative high frequency of tetracycline-resistant P. multocida isolates from fatal cases of bovine respiratory disease is related to the presence of minor tetracycline-resistance subpopulations within this species.
TI  - Potential pathogens carried by Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern Spain.
AB  - The Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern Spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. We sampled 321 ibex (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with Sarcoptes scabiei. A total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 Mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with S. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. Infections with Mycoplasma agalactiae and Mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. With Escherichia coli, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida biotype A, and Staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher isolation rates were associated with adults. The isolation frequency for E. coli was higher in females, whereas Moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated with males. The presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and M. haemolytica. The geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of Branhamella ovis, M. agalactiae, and all Pasteurella sp. Isolations of M. haemolytica, P. multocida biotype A, E. coli, and B. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging rather than captive animals. Of the gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. Mycoplasma agalactiae and M. arginini were the predominant Mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. The most frequently isolated gram-negative bacteria included E. coli, M. haemolytica, P. multocida biotype A, and B. ovis. Isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. In nasal samples, M. haemolytica and P. multocida biotype A were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, B. ovis and E. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.
TI  - Production of a D-glycero-D-manno-heptosyltransferase mutant of Mannheimia haemolytica displaying a veterinary pathogen specific conserved LPS structure; development and functionality of antibodies to this LPS structure.
AB  - Previous structural studies of the lipopolysaccharides from the veterinary pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (Ap) and Pasteurella multocida (Pm) had identified a conserved inner core oligosaccharide structure that was present in all strains investigated. In order to examine the potential of this inner core structure as a vaccine, a mutagenesis strategy was adopted to interrupt a D-glycero-D-manno-heptosyltransferase gene (losB) of Mh. This gene encodes the enzyme responsible for the addition of a D-glycero-D-manno-heptose residue, the first residue beyond the conserved inner core, and its inactivation exposed the conserved inner core structure as a terminal unit on the mutant LPS molecule. Subsequent analyses confirmed the targeted structure of the mutant LPS had been obtained, and complementation with losB in trans confirmed that the losB gene encodes an alpha-1,6-D-glycero-D-manno-heptosyltransferase. Monoclonal antibodies raised in mice to this LPS structure were found to recognise LPS and whole-cells of the truncated mutant and wild-type Mh. The antibodies were bactericidal against a wild-type Mh strain and were able to passively protect mice in a model of Mh disease. This illustrates that it is possible to raise functional antibodies against the conserved inner core LPS structure.
TI  - Contribution of respiratory burst activity to innate immune function and the effects of disease status and agent on chemiluminescence responses by ruminant phagocytes in vitro.
AB  - The mechanisms of interaction between phagocytes and different bacteria that help resolve lung infections or contribute to lung pathology are poorly defined. Alveolar phagocytes (resident macrophages and recruited neutrophils) make a major contribution to innate immunity by mounting a respiratory burst that helps kill internalised bacteria. However, this ability may be altered during or after exposure to infection. This review considers the application and limitations of a variety of analytical methods for oxygen-dependent mechanisms of respiratory burst in phagocytes initiated by soluble and particulate activators. Particular reference is given to the study in vitro of phagocytes from healthy and diseased ruminants during either natural infection with Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis or experimental infection with Pasteurella multocida or Mannheimia haemolytica.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated florfenicol resistance in Pasteurella trehalosi.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A florfenicol-resistant Pasteurella trehalosi isolate from a calf was investigated for the presence and the location of the gene floR. METHODS: The P. trehalosi isolate 13698 was investigated for its in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents and its plasmid content. A 14.9 kb plasmid, designated pCCK13698, was identified by transformation into Pasteurella multocida to mediate resistance to florfenicol, chloramphenicol and sulphonamides. The plasmid was sequenced completely and analysed for its structure and organization. RESULTS: Plasmid pCCK13698 exhibited extended similarity to plasmid pHS-Rec from Haemophilus parasuis including the region carrying the parA, repB, rec and int genes. Moreover, it revealed similarities to plasmid RSF1010 in the parts covering the mobC and repA-repC genes and to plasmid pMVSCS1 in the parts covering the sul2-catA3-strA gene cluster. Moreover, the floR gene area corresponded to that of transposon TnfloR. In addition, two complete insertion sequences were detected that were highly similar to IS1593 from Mannheimia haemolytica and IS26 from Enterobacteriaceae. Several potential recombination sites were identified that might explain the development of plasmid pCCK13698 by recombination events. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that in the bovine pathogen P. trehalosi, floR-mediated resistance to chloramphenicol and florfenicol was associated with a plasmid, which also carried functionally active genes for resistance to sulphonamides (sul2) and chloramphenicol (catA3). This is to the best of our knowledge the first report of resistance genes in P. trehalosi and only the second report of the presence of a florfenicol-resistance gene in target bacteria of the family Pasteurellaceae.
TI  - Evaluation of the prevalence and onset of lung lesions and their impact on growth of lambs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and temporal onset of lung lesions in lambs and the impact of lung lesions on growth of affected lambs. ANIMALS: 259 crossbred wether lambs from a single flock in the upper Midwestern United States. PROCEDURE: An observational study was conducted. Lambs born in the spring and fall were slaughtered at finished weight or at a predetermined time point. Lungs of each lamb were examined and classified as normal, moderate lesions (consolidation > 5% but < or = 50% of any lobe), or severe lesions (consolidation > 50% of any lobe). Data were examined to detect effects of prevalence or severity of lung lesions on growth and carcass traits. RESULTS: 57 of 89 (64%) spring-born lambs had lung lesions characterized by consolidation of lung tissue. A small number of lambs had pulmonary adhesions or active abscesses. In contrast, only 31 of 108 (29%) fall-born lambs had lung lesions. Severe lung lesions were associated with a significant reduction in average daily gain. Severe lung lesions were not detected until the middle of the finishing period and were associated with culture of Mannheimia haemolytica or Pasteurella multocida. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Analysis of results indicates that the prevalence of severe lung lesions can be quite high in lambs. Severe lung lesions can lead to greatly decreased growth performance of lambs.
TI  - Diseases and pathogens associated with mortality in Ontario beef feedlots.
AB  - This study determined the prevalence of diseases and pathogens associated with mortality or severe morbidity in 72 Ontario beef feedlots in calves that died or were euthanized within 60 days after arrival. Routine pathologic and microbiologic investigations, as well as immunohistochemical staining for detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) antigen, were performed on 99 calves that died or were euthanized within 60 days after arrival. Major disease conditions identified included fibrinosuppurative bronchopneumonia (49%), caseonecrotic bronchopneumonia or arthritis (or both) caused by Mycoplasma bovis (36%), viral respiratory disease (19%), BVDV-related diseases (21%), Histophilus somni myocarditis (8%), ruminal bloat (2%), and miscellaneous diseases (8%). Viral infections identified were BVDV (35%), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (9%), bovine herpesvirus-1 (6%), parainfluenza-3 virus (3%), and bovine coronavirus (2%). Bacteria isolated from the lungs included M. bovis (82%), Mycoplasma arginini (72%), Ureaplasma diversum (25%), Mannheimia haemolytica (27%), Pasteurella multocida (19%), H. somni (14%), and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (19%). Pneumonia was the most frequent cause of mortality of beef calves during the first 2 months after arrival in feedlots, representing 69% of total deaths. The prevalence of caseonecrotic bronchopneumonia caused by M. bovis was similar to that of fibrinosuppurative bronchopneumonia, and together, these diseases were the most common causes of pneumonia and death. M. bovis pneumonia and polyarthritis has emerged as an important cause of mortality in Ontario beef feedlots.
TI  - Identification of an immunogenic protein of Actinobacillus seminis that is present in microvesicles.
AB  - Actinobacillus seminis is a gram-negative bacterium of the Pasteurellaceae family that is involved in ovine epididymitis. Looking for a protein specific to this species, we determined the protein profile of subcellular fractions of A. seminis (American Type Culture Collection number 15768): proteins from the outer membrane (OMPs), inner membrane (IMPs), and cytoplasm (CPs). These profiles provide the first data, to our knowledge, regarding subcellular fractions of A. seminis. In the OMP fraction, we identified a protein with a molecular mass of 75 kDa that proved to be immunogenic and apparently specific for A. seminis. This conclusion was based on the reaction of hyperimmune serum of rabbits inoculated with whole cells of A. seminis that was tested against sonicated complete cells of reference strains and field isolates of Brucella ovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni. No protein of these bacteria cross-reacted with the 75-kDa protein of A. seminis. Furthermore, when each type of hyperimmune serum was tested against the sonicated cells and each of the subcellular fractions of A. seminis, it did not recognize the A. seminis 75-kDa protein. We also isolated and identified this protein in microvesicles released to the culture supernatant. The results suggest that the 75-kDa protein could be used to establish a diagnostic test specific for ovine epididymitis caused by A. seminis.
TI  - Results of the antimicrobial agent susceptibility study raised in a representative, cross-sectional monitoring study on a national basis.
AB  - The use of antimicrobial substances in human and veterinary medicine inevitably results in a selection pressure for drug resistance in exposed bacteria. Preventive measures, apt to avoid the consequent development of new resistances and selection for existing ones, respectively, have to be elaborated. Moreover, it has to be ensured that neither resistant bacteria nor resistance genes are spread to and consequently via the food chain. Respiratory diseases as well as mastitis in dairy cattle belong to the most frequently occurring diseases in food-producing animals. For the first time in Germany, a comprehensive, cross-sectional study into the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria associated with these disease patterns in food-producing animals was conducted by the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) in 2001. The selection of examined bacterial species comprised Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica associated with respiratory disease in pigs, and Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. causing mastitis in dairy cattle. Bacterial strains were collected following a representative sampling scheme, taking into account the total number of animals in the individual German federal Lander. In an analogous study conducted in 2002/2003, this selection was extended by the indication respiratory disease in juvenile cattle, caused by P. multocida and M. haemolytica, respectively. In comparison with data from 2001, MIC values determined in 2002/2003 suggested significantly lower or higher degrees of drug susceptibility only for a few antimicrobial agents. Comparison was carried out on the basis of bacterial species and individual federal Lander, respectively. Overall, the data raised in both studies revealed substantially lower resistance rates than published for Germany so far. This is particularly true for results from those Lander, whose animal health services had implemented preventive strategies to control infectious diseases. No correlation could be established between differing animal population densities and differences in the prevalence of resistance in corresponding Lander. However, the geographical distribution of occurrence of resistance against beta-lactam antimicrobial agents suggests different therapeutic strategies employed in different sized animal flocks. In federal Lander marked by large-scale livestock farming, significantly higher resistance values could be measured for cephalosporins than for penicillins, whereas in Lander with rather traditional farming structures, resistance to penicillins was predominant. Assuming otherwise similar factors of influence on the emergence of resistance, this pattern suggests that cephalosporins are preferably used in large enterprises and penicillins in smaller farms, respectively. Currently, mechanisms effecting changes in antimicrobial resistance are being further investigated in a successive study.
TI  - Monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria from livestock animals.
AB  - Facing the problem of development and spreading of bacterial resistance, preventive strategies are considered the most appropriate means to counteract. The establishment of corresponding management options relies on scientifically defensible efforts to obtain objective data on the prevalence of bacterial resistance in healthy and diseased livestock. Additionally, detailed statistics are needed on the overall amount of antimicrobial agents dispensed in Germany. The collection of valid data on the prevalence of resistance requires representative and cross-sectional studies. The German national antimicrobial resistance monitoring of the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) determines the current quantitative resistance level of life-stock pathogens, in order to permit the evaluation and surveillance of the distribution of resistances on a valid basis. Essential key features determining the design of these studies comprise (1) a statistically valid sampling program. This incorporates regional differences in animal population density, (2) the avoidance of "copy strains", (3) testing of no more than two bacterial strains belonging to one species per herd, (4) testing only if no antimicrobial therapy preceded sample collection, and (5) the use of standardized methods [e.g. microdilution broth method to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)]. The analysis and interpretation of this data permits reliable identification and definition of epidemiological characteristics of resistance and its development in animal associated bacteria, such as geographically and time wise differentiated profiles on its prevalence, the emergence of unknown phenotypes of resistance and an assessment of the threat resistant bacteria from animals pose for humans. In applied antimicrobial therapy, the data can serve as a decision guidance in choosing the antimicrobial agent most adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation. The susceptibility testing performed by the BVL suggests substantially lower degrees of resistance in bacteria isolated from cattle (mastitis: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp.; respiratory disease: Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica) and pigs (respiratory disease: Pasteurella multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica) in comparison to data published for Germany so far. This includes results for substances that have given cause for frequent debate. Only rare cases of resistance to enrofloxacin (fluoroquinolone) could be detected, and only 3% of bacterial strains tested proved resistant to 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, including substances prescribed in human medicine.
TI  - Maternally and naturally acquired antibodies to Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida in beef calves.
AB  - The dynamics and duration of maternally derived antibodies as well as the onset of acquired immunity against Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida in range-pastured beef calves were investigated. Two groups of unvaccinated cattle were used in this study. Serum antibody responses were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay for antibodies of the IgG1, IgG2 and IgM isotypes binding M. haemolytica whole cells (WC) or leukotoxin (LKT) and P. multocida outer membrane proteins (OMPs). Comparisons of mean antibody responses to M. haemolytica LKT and WC and P. multocida OMPs were made within each group. Maternally derived antibodies against M. haemolytica and P. multocida reached lowest levels at 30-90 days after birth. Calves began production of antibodies against M. haemolytica and P. multocida between 60 and 90 days of age in both groups. Based on the results of this study, in beef herds vaccinated against M. haemolytica and/or P. multocida, it may be best to vaccinate calves around 3 months of age. In contrast, beef calves from unvaccinated herds might benefit from vaccination at 4 months of age.
TI  - Variability in acquired resistance of Pasteurella and Mannheimia isolates from the nasopharynx of calves, with particular reference to different herd types.
AB  - To measure the level of antimicrobial resistance in potential bovine respiratory  pathogens at different production types, nasal swabs were collected from 57 calves of 13 dairy herds, 150 calves of 9 beef cattle herds, and 289 calves of 5 high-density veal calf herds and investigated for the presence of Pasteurellaceae. All calves were less than 6 months old. Susceptibilities of the Pasteurella and Mannheimia isolates to eight antimicrobials were determined using an agar dilution method. P. multocida (37.3%) and hemolytic Mannheimia organisms (M. haemolytica sensu lato) (6.3%) were the most frequently detected organisms. The overall prevalence of isolates resistant to at least one antimicrobial from the dairy, beef, and veal calves were 17.6% (6/34), 21.9% (14/64), and 71.9% (64/89), respectively. In isolates obtained on the veal calf herds, acquired resistance to ampicillin, oxytetracycline, potentiated sulfonamides, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and enrofloxacin was frequently present, and 32.6% of these isolates were resistant to more than two of the tested antimicrobials. Resistance to ceftiofur and florfenicol was not detected. A substantial within-herd variability of species diversity and resistance profiles among isolates belonging to the genera Pasteurella and Mannheimia was found among the isolates of the veal calf farms.
TI  - Construction of in-frame aroA deletion mutants of Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Haemophilus somnus by using a new temperature-sensitive plasmid.
AB  - A temperature-sensitive (TS) plasmid was generated from the endogenous streptomycin resistance plasmid of Mannheimia hemolytica and used to engineer in-frame aroA deletion mutants of Mannheimia hemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Haemophilus somnus. TS replacement plasmids carrying in-frame aroA deletions were constructed for each target species and introduced into host cells by electroporation. After recovery in broth, cells were spread onto plates containing antibiotic and incubated at 30 degrees C, the permissive temperature for autonomous plasmid replication. Transfer of transformants to selective plates cultured at a nonpermissive temperature for plasmid replication selected for single-crossover mutants consisting of replacement plasmids that had integrated into host chromosomes by homologous recombination. Transfer of the single-crossover mutants back to a permissive temperature without antibiotic selection drove plasmid resolution, and, depending on where plasmid excision occurred, either deletion mutants or wild-type cells were generated. The system used here represents a broadly applicable means for generating unmarked mutants of Pasteurellaceae species.
TI  - Generation and molecular characterization of new temperature-sensitive plasmids intended for genetic engineering of Pasteurellaceae.
AB  - Temperature-sensitive (TS) plasmids were generated through chemical mutagenesis of a derivative of the streptomycin resistance parent plasmid pD70, isolated from Mannheimia hemolytica serotype 1. Three TS plasmids which failed to replicate at or above 42 degrees C in M. hemolytica but which were fully functional below 31 degrees C were selected for further analysis. Two of the TS plasmids were shown by sequencing to possess unique single-base-pair mutations. The third TS plasmid contained a unique base pair substitution and a second mutation that had been previously identified. These mutations were clustered within a 200-bp region of the presumed plasmid origin of replication. Site-directed single-nucleotide substitutions were introduced into the wild-type pD70 origin of replication to confirm that mutations identified by sequencing had conferred thermoregulated replication. Deletion analysis on the wild-type pD70 plasmid replicon revealed that approximately 720 bp are necessary for plasmid maintenance. Replication of the TS plasmids was thermoregulated in Pasteurella multocida and Haemophilus somnus as well. To consistently transform H. somnus with TS plasmid, in vitro DNA methylation with commercially available HhaI methyltransferase was necessary to protect against the organism's restriction enzyme HsoI (recognition sequence 5'-GCGC-3') characterized herein.
TI  - Effect of tilmicosin on chemotactic, phagocytic, and bactericidal activities of bovine and porcine alveolar macrophages.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate chemotactic, phagocytic, and bactericidal activities of bovine and porcine alveolar macrophages (AM) exposed to tilmicosin. ANIMALS: 12 healthy calves and 12 healthy pigs. PROCEDURES: Lungs were obtained immediately after euthanasia; AM were collected by means of bronchoalveolar lavage and density gradient centrifugation. Chemotactic activity was evaluated by exposing AM to lipopolysaccharide or macrophage inhibitory peptide during incubation with tilmicosin. Phagocytic activity was evaluated by incubating AM with tilmicosin for 24 hours and then with tilmicosin-resistant Salmonella serotype Typhimurium. Bactericidal activity was evaluated by incubating AM with tilmicosin (0, 10, or 20 microg/ml for bovine AM; 0 or 10 microg/ml or 10 microg/ml but washed free of tilmicosin for porcine AM) and then with Mannheimia haemolytica (bovine AM) or with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae or Pasteurella multocida (porcine AM). RESULTS: Tilmicosin had no significant effects on chemotactic or phagocytic activities of bovine or porcine AM. The time-course of bactericidal activity was best described by polynomial equations. Time to cessation of bacterial growth and area under the time versus bacterial number curve were significantly affected by incubation of AM with tilmicosin. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results show that bactericidal activity of bovine and porcine AM was enhanced by tilmicosin, but not in proportion to the reported ability of AM to concentrate tilmicosin intracellularly. With or without exposure to tilmicosin, the time-course of bactericidal activity of bovine AM against M haemolytica and of porcine AM against A pleuropneumoniae or P multocida was too complex to be reduced to a simple linear equation.
TI  - Efficacy of tulathromycin in the treatment and prevention of natural outbreaks of bovine respiratory disease in European cattle.
AB  - The efficacy of tulathromycin in the treatment (phase 1) and prevention (phase 2) of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) was evaluated on commercial farms in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. In phase 1, commingled cattle with clinical BRD were treated with tulathromycin (n = 128) or florfenicol (n = 125) on day 0. Similar percentages of animals showed sustained clinical improvement at day 14 (tulathromycin 83.3% versus florfenicol 81.0%) and had not relapsed by day 60 (tulathromycin 63.3% versus florfenicol 58.4%). In phase 2, healthy in-contact cattle were treated with tulathromycin (n = 492), tilmicosin (n = 494), or saline (n = 265) on day 0. Significantly more (P = .0001) tulathromycin-treated cattle remained healthy to day 14 (92.4%) than tilmicosin-treated (83.7%) or saline-treated (63.7%) cattle, and this was maintained through day 60 (tulathromycin 85.4% versus tilmicosin 75.1% and saline 56.2%). Tulathromycin was highly effective in the treatment and prevention of BRD.
TI  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations of tulathromycin against respiratory bacterial  pathogens isolated from clinical cases in European cattle and swine and variability arising from changes in in vitro methodology.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tulathromycin was evaluated against common bovine and porcine respiratory pathogens collected from outbreaks of clinical disease across eight European countries from 1998 to 2001. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for one isolate of each bacterial species from each outbreak were determined using a broth microdilution technique. The lowest concentrations inhibiting the growth of 90% of isolates (MIC90) for tulathromycin were 2 microg/ml for Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica, 1 microg/ml for Pasteurella multocida (bovine), and 2 microg/ml for Pasteurella multocida (porcine) and ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml for Histophilus somni (Haemophilus somnus) and from 4 to 16 microg/ml for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Isolates were retested in the presence of serum. The activity of tulathromycin against fastidious organisms was affected by culture conditions, and MICs were reduced in the presence of serum.
TI  - tet(L)-mediated tetracycline resistance in bovine Mannheimia and Pasteurella isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tetracycline-resistant Mannheimia and Pasteurella isolates, which were negative for the tetracycline resistance genes (tet) commonly detected among these bacteria, were investigated for other tet genes present and their location. METHODS: Mannheimia and Pasteurella isolates were investigated for their MICs of tetracycline and their plasmid content. Identification of tet genes was achieved by PCR. Plasmids mediating tetracycline resistance were identified by transformation and hybridization experiments. Plasmid pCCK3259 from Mannheimia haemolytica was sequenced completely and analysed for its structure and organization. RESULTS: All tetracycline-resistant isolates carried the gene tet(L) either on plasmids or on the chromosome. Two M. haemolytica isolates and one Mannheimia glucosida isolate harboured a common 5.3 kb tet(L) plasmid, designated pCCK3259. This plasmid was similar to the tet(B)-carrying tetracycline resistance plasmid pHS-Tet from Haemophilus parasuis and the streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance plasmid pCCK647 from Pasteurella multocida in the parts coding for mobilization functions. The tet(L) gene was closely related to that of the Geobacillus stearothermophilus plasmid pTB19. However, the translational attenuator responsible for the tetracycline-inducible expression of tet(L) was missing in plasmid pCCK3259. A recombination site was identified downstream of tet(L), which might explain the integration of the tet(L) gene region into a basic pCCK3259 replicon. CONCLUSION: A tet(L) gene was shown for the first time to be responsible for tetracycline resistance in Mannheimia and Pasteurella isolates. This report demonstrates a lateral transfer of a tetracycline efflux gene in Gram-negative bovine respiratory tract pathogens, probably originating from Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of florfenicol against bacteria isolated from bovine and porcine respiratory disease.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of florfenicol (FFC) against 243 bacterial agents isolated in Korea from cattle and pigs with respiratory disease were investigated by agar diffusion and microdilution broth methods following the recommendations provided by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. All Actinobacillus pleuropnemoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica and 98.6% of the Bordetella bronchiseptica isolates were susceptible to FFC, which as significantly more effective than the other antibiotics used in this study. FFC also showed high in vitro antimicrobial activities (MIC(90) < or = 1 microg/ml) against all strains tested with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination ranging from 0.12 to 4 microg/ml. No resistant strains of A. pleuropneumoniae, P. multocida and M. haemolytica to FFC have apparently developed since the first introduction of this antibiotics for veterinary use in Korea. The results suggest that FFC is therapeutically valuable in the treatment of primary or complicating bacterial pathogens causing of the bovine and swine respiratory tract.
TI  - Viral and bacterial pathogens in bovine respiratory disease in Finland.
AB  - Pathogens causing bovine respiratory tract disease in Finland were investigated.  Eighteen cattle herds with bovine respiratory disease were included. Five diseased calves from each farm were chosen for closer examination and tracheobronchial lavage. Blood samples were taken from the calves at the time of the investigation and from 86 calves 3-4 weeks later. In addition, 6-10 blood samples from animals of different ages were collected from each herd, resulting in 169 samples. Serum samples were tested for antibodies to bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (PIV-3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine adenovirus-3 (BAV-3) and bovine adenovirus-7 (BAV-7). About one third of the samples were also tested for antibodies to bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) with negative results. Bacteria were cultured from lavage fluid and in vitro susceptibility to selected antimicrobials was tested. According to serological findings, PIV-3, BAV-7, BAV-3, BCV and BRSV are common pathogens in Finnish cattle with respiratory problems. A titre rise especially for BAV-7 and BAV-3, the dual growth of Mycoplasma dispar and Pasteurella multocida, were typical findings in diseased calves. Pasteurella sp. strains showed no resistance to tested antimicrobials. Mycoplasma bovis and Mannheimia haemolytica were not found.
TI  - [The prevalence of antimicrobial susceptibility of veterinary pathogens isolated  from cattle and pigs: national antibiotic resistance monitoring 2002/2003 of the BVL].
AB  - The national antimicrobial resistance monitoring determines the current quantitative resistance level of life-stock pathogens, in order to permit the evaluation and surveillance of the distribution of resistances on a valid basis. During the examination period from June 2002 to July 2003, a total of 1849 pathogens was collected, following a representative German-wide pattern in collaboration with 29 laboratories. The selection of examined bacterial strains included different specimen causing respiratory diseases in fattening pigs (Pasteurella multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica) and cattle (Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica), respectively, as well as strains causing mastitis in dairy cows (Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., E. coli). Determination of the in-vitro susceptibility (minimal inhibitory concentration) to at least 17 antimicrobial agents was performed centrally by the BVL using the microdilution broth method. The findings approximately match results of an analogous study conducted in 2001, and correspondingly revealed significantly lower resistance-values in comparison to data published for Germany so far. No correlation could be established between the incidence of resistance and differing stock densities. By means of the resistance monitoring data gathered by the BVL, the risk potential of antimicrobials applied in Germany can be reliably defined. This valuable information about the epidemiological situation of resistance in Germany can be helpful to veterinarians as a decision guidance when choosing appropriate means of therapy. Accordingly, the results stated by the BVL are apt to provide an important contribution to improving the safety of food-animal products. The experiences obtained from the monitoring also show that valid data about the antimicrobial susceptibility can only be raised on an interdisciplinary approach (federal agencies, county diagnostic laboratories, universities, industry). Currently, the BVL put into practice a study with an extended spectrum of bacterial species and indications.
TI  - [Pasteurella: insights into the virulence determinants of a heterogenous bacterial type].
AB  - Pasteurella (P.) multocida is the causative agent of numerous economically relevant diseases worldwide. These are enzootic bronchopneumonia in cattle and sheep and hemorraghic septicemia in cattle and buffaloes, Rhinitis atrophicans in swine, snuffles in rabbit, and fowl cholera. All disease complexes are associated with certain capsular and somatic antigens. Even as human pathogen P. multocida is of increasing importance, causing wound infections, and even septicemia, meningitis, and endocarditis. Despite extensive research activities including the genome analysis of one fowl cholera isolate in the year 2001 there are a lot of open questions concerning the molecular pathogenic mechanisms. Problems encountered are the high antigenic variability and the wide host spectrum of P. multocida as well as different courses of infection. In consequence there are enormous difficulties in producing vaccines. Transcriptomics and proteomics hopefully will give new insight into the pathogenesis of P. multocida infections in different hosts. A frequent problem particular in classical diagnostic laboratories is the diagnosis of P. multocida and its differentiation from other P. species and Mannheimia (M.) haemolytica. The biochemical identification of P. multocida is not reliable due to variable phenotypical characteristics often caused by different culture conditions, and it is time consuming and cost-intensive. Extensive molecular biologic studies concerning the prevalence and distribution of virulence associated genes known so far in P. species, which will be described in detail in this paper, could contribute to the establishment of a diagnostic tool, such as a multiplex polymerase chain reaction, that would provide a cheap and time-saving identification and characterization of wildtype strains.
TI  - Isolation and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens from bovine pneumonia: 1994--2002.
AB  - Between 1994 and 2002, a total of 390 (46.3%) Mannheimia haemolytica, 292 (34.7%) Pasteurella multocida, and 160 (19.0%) Histophilus somni were isolated at the Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory from lungs from 6-18-month-old beef cattle with pneumonia. The ratio of M. haemolytica isolations to P. multocida isolations decreased from 3.1 in 1994 to 0.8 in 2000 while increasing to 1.5 in 2002. Mannheimia haemolytica isolations significantly (P < 0.05) decreased from 62.5% in 1994 to between 30.6% and 50.4% in 1998--2002. Pasteurella multocida isolations significantly (P < 0.05) increased from 20.0% in 1994 to between 28.6% and 47.4% in 1998--2002. Histophilus somni isolations were <19% except in 1998 (40.8%) and 1999 (23%). Antimicrobial susceptibilities for M. haemolytica significantly declined for erythromycin (P = 0.0001), florfenicol (P = 0.0004), spectinomycin (P = 0.0001), and tilmicosin (P = 0.03). For P. multocida, antimicrobial susceptibilities significantly declined for erythromycin (P = 0.0001), florfenicol (P = 0.004), spectinomycin (P = 0.03), sulfachloropyridizine (P = 0.028), tetracycline (P = 0.017), tilmicosin (P = 0.0001), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (P = 0.0003). Antimicrobial susceptibilities for H. somni were variable for spectinomycin and sulfachloropyridizine, whereas susceptibilities to other antibiotics remained consistently high.
TI  - Seven years survey of susceptibility to marbofloxacin of bovine pathogenic strains from eight European countries.
AB  - This study was conducted from 1994 to 2001 to determine the susceptibility of bovine pathogenic bacteria to marbofloxacin (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). Strains originated in bovine diseases from eight European countries. They were isolated from gut infections (Escherichia coli, salmonellae), mastitis (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae) and respiratory diseases (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus somnus). There was no change in the MIC distributions for each species after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1997. In E. coli, a resistant population was present before the use of marbofloxacin having been induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. Over this period the only a significant change seen was an increase in MIC(90) of E. coli from the gut (1.275 microg/ml in 1994/1995 to 5.098 microg/ml in 2001). All the salmonellae were susceptible to marbofloxacin with a MIC(90) = 0.073 microg/ml in 2001 without development of high level resistance. The use of marbofloxacin seems not to have favoured a significant increase and spreading of resistant bacteria.
TI  - In vitro microbiological characterization of a novel azalide, two triamilides and an azalide ketal against bovine and porcine respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Several novel 15-membered-ring macrolide agents (azalide 1, triamilides 2 and 3,  and the azalide 3,6-ketal 4) were identified as potential antibacterial agents against Mannheimia (formerly named as Pasteurella) haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus somnus and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, important etiological agents of bovine and porcine respiratory disease. Compound 3 is the major component of the antibiotic tulathromycin. Antibacterial activity against tilmicosin-resistant P. multocida field isolates was also tested. In vitro MIC 50/90 analysis revealed that the four newly synthesized compounds were more potent than tilmicosin against M. haemolytica (4 to approximately 8x), P. multocida (8 to approximately 16x), A. pleuropneumoniae (4x), H. somnus (2x and 16x), and tilmicosin-resistant P. multocida (32x). In time-kill kinetic studies, all four novel compounds and tilmicosin showed bactericidal activity against M. haemolytica, P. multocida and A. pleuropneumoniae at both 4x and 8x MIC. A functional assay using genetically defined mutants revealed that all four novel compounds were poorer substrates for the efflux pump, AcrA/B system, than tilmicosin. A pH study using LPS mutants indicated that the enhanced in vitro potency of the triamilides, particularly compound 3 was mainly due to better penetration of the molecule through the outer membrane. The third amine group at the C-4'' position of the triamilde molecules contributed to this increased membrane penetration by increasing overall basicity. These studies indicate that the four novel compounds have potential as antibacterial agents against bovine and porcine respiratory disease.
TI  - Pathophysiological and immune cell responses in calves prior to and following lung challenge with formalin-killed Pasteurella multocida biotype A:3 and protection studies involving subsequent homologous live challenge.
AB  - Pneumonic pasteurellosis is a common respiratory infection in cattle that has major economic and welfare implications world-wide and the incidence in the UK due to Pasteurella multocida, currently the same as that associated with Mannheimia haemolytica, is increasing. Whereas much is known regarding the pathogenesis of M. haemolytica infections little information is available on the pathogenic process of pasteurellosis initiated by P. multocida. In the present work calf systemic and innate immune responses to intratracheal challenge with formalin-killed P. multocida biotype A:3 and to subsequent experimental lung infection with live P. multocida were investigated. Eight-week-old calves were challenged intratracheally on day 0 with either 10(9) colony forming units (cfu) of formalin-killed P. multocida biotype A:3 in 300 ml saline (n = 10) or 300 ml saline alone (n = 10), followed, at day 21, by challenge with 10(9) cfu live P. multocida. Pathophysiological and lung phagocyte responses were assessed by clinical monitoring, sequential lung lavage and blood sampling. Results for samples obtained before, during and after challenge showed clinical and acute phase protein responses to both bacterial culture and saline control treatments, although higher responses were associated with bacterial challenge. Phagocytosis of P. multocida during 1h incubation periods with lavaged cells in vitro was unaffected by exposure in vivo to killed P. multocida and there was evidence that P. multocida was able to survive intracellularly during this assay. There was no indication that lung exposure to formalin-killed P. multocida conferred protection against subsequent homologous live challenge.
TI  - Experimental infectious respiratory disease in groups of calves: lobar distribution, variance, and sample-size requirements for vaccine evaluation.
AB  - The distribution and variance of respiratory disease produced with aerosols of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) and Mannheimia haemolytica in control (183 calves in 44 experiments) and vaccinated calves were studied in experiments conducted at the Animal Diseases Research Institute, Lethbridge, Alberta, from 1975 to 1989. All calves had been born and raised at this institute and exposed similarly for 5 min by means of a face mask to viral and bacterial aerosols produced by a Collison atomizer (particles < 3 microm in diameter). We summarized the macroscopic pathological responses of pneumonia (main end point), tonsillitis, tracheitis, and other microbiologic and experimental variables. We also summarized the lobar distribution of pneumonia in 202 control and 192 vaccinated calves with this disease model and in calves similarly exposed to parainfluenza 3 virus/M. haemolytica or BHV-1/Pasteurella multocida. Pneumonia in control calves began in ventral tissues of all lobes, with lobar preferences, and progressed dorsally, the dorsal parts of both large caudal lobes being least affected. A high variance of pneumonia was evident within and among experiments. From the magnitude of variance observed in the control groups, the number of calves per group required in vaccine-challenge studies using this BHV-1/M. haemolytica disease model was estimated. Such estimates are required for any disease model used in vaccine-challenge studies.
TI  - Efficacy of danofloxacin in the treatment of respiratory disease in European cattle.
AB  - The efficacy of an injectable formulation of danofloxacin (180 mg/ml) in the treatment of naturally occurring bovine respiratory disease was evaluated in field studies on farms in France, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Cattle aged one week to 15 months with clinical respiratory disease were randomly allocated to treatment with 6 mg/kg danofloxacin or 10 mg/kg tilmicosin, administered by a single subcutaneous injection on day 0. A second injection of danofloxacin was administered on day 2, only if predefined clinical criteria were met. Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Haemophilus somnus were isolated from pretreatment nasopharyngeal swabs taken on all the farms. After the treatment, there was a more rapid improvement in the clinical response of the 178 animals treated with danofloxacin by day 2 (P < 0.01) than in the 90 treated with tilmicosin. For both treatments, there were similar significant (P < 0.001) reductions in the mean rectal temperature and severity of clinical signs of abnormal respiration and depression, on days 4 and 10 compared with day 0; 78.1 per cent of the animals treated with danofloxacin and 78.5 per cent of those treated with tilmicosin completed the studies. Danofloxacin 18 per cent was clinically safe and as effective as tilmicosin in the treatment of bovine respiratory disease.
TI  - tRNA-intergenic spacer PCR for the identification of Pasteurella and Mannheimia spp.
AB  - tRNA-intergenic spacer PCR (tDNA-PCR) was evaluated for its effectiveness in differentiating Pasteurella and Mannheimia (sub)species predominantly of ruminant origin. For this purpose, 38 reference strains and 13 field isolates belonging to both genera were investigated. tDNA-PCR enabled discrimination of all Pasteurella species tested (Pasteurella (P.) aerogenes, P. avium, P. canis, P. lymphangitidis, P. multocida, P. trehalosi). For the differentiation of the subspecies of P. multocida, an additional dulcitol reaction was required. Two of the five so far-defined Mannheimia species, M. granulomatis and M. varigena, had a distinct fingerprinting profile. The remaining three phylogenetically highly related species (M. haemolytica, M. glucosida, and M. ruminalis) clustered together. Nevertheless, M. ruminalis is non-haemolytic, and M. haemolytica and M. glucosida can be differentiated on the basis of two additional phenotypic characteristics (beta-glucosidase and aesculin hydrolysis). In conclusion, tDNA-PCR is a useful tool in differentiating organisms belonging to the genera Pasteurella and Mannheimia.
TI  - Effects of dietary energy and starch concentrations for newly received feedlot calves: I. Growth performance and health.
AB  - Crossbred calves (n = 572; initial BW = 186 +/- 27 kg) purchased from northern Texas, Arkansas, and southeast Oklahoma auction markets were delivered to the Willard Sparks Beef Research Center, Stillwater, OK, and used to study the effects of dietary energy and starch concentrations on performance and health of newly received feedlot calves during a 42-d receiving period. On arrival, calves were assigned randomly to one of two dietary energy levels (0.85 or 1.07 Mcal NEg/kg DM) and one of two dietary starch levels (34 or 48% of ME from starch) in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Cattle were weighed and serum samples were collected on d 0, 7, 14, 28, and 42. Individual animal records of morbidity were kept for all cases of respiratory and other disease. Nasal swabs were collected from each morbid animal and cultured for upper-respiratory pathogens. There were no energy x starch level interactions for performance or health response variables. Daily gain (1.14 kg/d) and gain efficiency (ADG:DMI = 0.179) were not affected by increasing dietary energy or starch concentrations. Calves fed low-energy diets consumed (P < 0.05) more DM. No difference (P = 0.54) was detected in morbidity for calves fed high-energy (62.4% calves treated) compared with low-energy (65.8% calves treated) diets; however, calves fed the high-starch diets had numerically (P = 0.11) greater morbidity than calves fed low-starch diets (68.8 vs. 59.4% calves treated, respectively). There were no energy or starch effects on Mannheimia haemolytica or Pasteurella multocida antibody titers; however, day effects (P < 0.02) occurred. On d 7, 14, and 28, calves had antibody titers for P. multocida that were greater (P < 0.05) than titers on d 0. In addition, calves had greater antibody titers to M. haemolytica on d 7 and 14 than on d 0. Nasal swabs revealed that calves fed the high-energy diets tended (P = 0.06) to have a lower percentage of morbid calves with P. multocida during the first antimicrobial treatment and a lower percentage of Haemophilus somnus isolates during the first (P = 0.01) and second (P = 0.06) antimicrobial treatments than calves fed the low-energy diets. Although animal performance was not influenced, the present data suggest that feeding the high-energy diet decreased the percentage of P. multocida and H. somnus pathogens in calves that received one or more antimicrobial treatments.
TI  - Otitis in cattle, an aetiological review.
AB  - Otitis externa in cattle has a significant impact in tropical and subtropical regions, and the aetiological agents are predominantly rhabditiform nematodes and mites of the genus Raillietia. Its prevalence is higher in mature and Zebu cattle. In advanced clinical cases there can be irreversible and fatal neural lesions. Ear infection in calves has been associated with concurrent respiratory diseases and mixed infection. The principal reported agents of otitis in calves are bacteria such as Actinomyces spp., Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus somnus, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas spp., Streptococcus spp. and Mycoplasma bovis. The control and treatment of bovine otitis is not standardized and there is little evidence-based support for the diverse treatments available in the literature.
TI  - Maternally derived humoral immunity to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) 1a, BVDV1b, BVDV2, bovine herpesvirus-1, parainfluenza-3 virus bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida in beef calves, antibody decline by half-life studies and effect on response to vaccination.
AB  - The passive immunity transferred to calves from their dams was investigated in a  beef herd to determine half-life of antibody, estimated time to seronegative status and effect on immunization. One hundred two beef calves in a commercial ranch under standard management conditions were utilized. Samples were collected at branding (day 0). This was the first possible date to collect samples postcalving. This was approximately 2 months postcalving, and days 95 and 116. The calves were divided into two groups: vaccinates (51) and nonvaccinates (51). The calves were vaccinated with a commercial inactivated viral vaccine containing bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)1a, BVDV2, bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), parainfluenza-3 virus (PI-3V), and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) on days 0 and 95. Half of the vaccinated and unvaccinated calves also received one dose of an experimental Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida vaccine at day 95. Serums were tested for neutralizing antibody titers to BVDV1a, BVDV1b, BVDV2, BHV-1, PI-3V, and BRSV. Antibodies were detected by ELISA to M. haemolytica whole cell, M. haemolytica leukotoxin, and P. multocida outer membrane protein (OMP). The mean half-life of viral antibodies in nonvaccinated calves to each virus was: BVDV1a, 23.1 days (d); BVDV1b, 22.8 d; BVDV2, 22.9 d; BHV-1, 21.2 d; PI-3V, 30.3 d; and BRSV, 35.9 d. The mean half-life of viral antibodies was greater for vaccinates than for nonvaccinates for all viruses except BRSV. The calculated mean time to seronegative status for nonvaccinates based on titers at day 0 was: BVDV1a, 192.2 d; BVDV1b, 179.1 d; BVDV2, 157.8 d; BHV-1, 122.9 d; PI-3V, 190.6 d; and BRSV, 186.7 d. There was an active immune response after vaccination with two doses to all the viruses, except BRSV. Mean antibody titers of vaccinates at day 116 were statistically higher than nonvaccinates for all viruses except BRSV. However on an individual calf basis there were few seroconversions (four-fold rise or greater to BVDV1a, BVDV1b, BVDV2, PI-3V, or BRSV; or two-fold rise for BHV-1) in the presence of viral antibodies. The predicted time of seronegative status for a group of calves for vaccination programs may not be appropriate as there may be a range of titers for all calves at day 0. In this study the range for BVDV1a was 16-16,384; BVDV1b, 8-8192; BVDV2, 0-8192; BHV-1, 0-935; PI-3V, 8-2048; and BRSV, 8-4096. Using the half-life of 23 d for BVDV1a, the time thereafter for seronegative status would be 46 and 299 d compared to the calculated date of 192.2 d using the mean of estimated time to seronegative status for all the calves. There was an active humoral response in the vaccinated calves to M. haemolytica and P. multocida. Cowherd humoral immunity based on serum antibodies should be monitored as it may relate to transfer of maternal antibodies to calves. Exceptionally high levels of viral antibodies transferred to calves could interfere with the antibody response to vaccination.
TI  - In vitro activities of spectinomycin and comparator agents against Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica from respiratory tract infections of cattle.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prior to the renewal of spectinomycin licensing for veterinary uses in Germany, 154 Pasteurella multocida and 148 Mannheimia haemolytica strains from respiratory tract infections in cattle were investigated for their MICs of spectinomycin and other antimicrobial agents. The data obtained should serve as a baseline from which to judge the future development of resistance. Moreover, the in vitro activity of spectinomycin in comparison with other antimicrobials should be assessed. METHODS: MIC determination for all 302 strains was performed by the broth dilution method and evaluated according to NCCLS standards. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values were calculated. Strains resistant to spectinomycin were subjected to PCR assays for genes known to mediate spectinomycin resistance in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. RESULTS: With the exception of resistance to sulfamethoxazole in P. multocida and M. haemolytica, and resistance to ampicillin in M. haemolytica, an overall low level of resistance was detected. A total of 93.5% of the P. multocida and 98.6% of the M. haemolytica strains were susceptible to spectinomycin, with MIC(90)s of 32 mg/L. PCR analysis showed that none of the spectinomycin-resistant strains carried any of the aadA gene subtypes, nor the genes spc or aad(9). CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the renewal of spectinomycin, only a small number of spectinomycin-resistant strains was detected among bovine P. multocida and M. haemolytica. The genes responsible for spectinomycin resistance in these strains seemed to be different from those so far known to occur in other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Pasteurella multocida- and Pasteurella haemolytica-ghosts: new vaccine candidates.
AB  - Pasteurella multocida is an important animal pathogen. Bacterial ghosts produced  by the expression of phage PhiX174 lysis gene E are empty cells devoid of cytoplasmic and genomic material. Lysis of P. multocida 7A and P. haemolytica A1 carrying Pasteurella-specific lysis vectors (pSR2 and pSON2) occurred 140 min after induction of gene E expression induced by temperature upshift. The E-mediated cell lysis and killing activity was the same in both Pasteurella species and no viable cells could be detected after lysis of P. multocida and P. haemolytica. Pasteurella ghosts were used for immunization of rabbits and mice. Rabbits immunized subcutaneously with either P. multocida- or P. haemolytica-ghosts developed antibodies reacting with the immunizating strain, as well as with other Pasteurella strains. The number of proteins in whole cell protein extracts recognized by the sera constantly increased during the observation period of 51 days. In addition, dose-dependent protection against homologous challenge was observed in mice immunized with P. multocida-ghosts. Animals which received 1.15 x 10(8) ghosts and a challenge dose of up to 60 cfu (LD90), showed 100% protection. According to these results, we suggest ghosts of P. multocida and P. haemolytica as new vaccine candidates.
TI  - In vitro activities of florfenicol against bovine and porcine respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - Florfenicol in vitro activities for a total of 756 bacterial isolates from respiratory tract infections of cattle and swine were comparatively investigated by the agar diffusion method and the microdilution broth method. Florfenicol showed high in vitro activity against Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis, with all of the isolates inhibited by </=2 micro g of florfenicol per ml.
TI  - Response of calves persistently infected with noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) subtype 1b after vaccination with heterologous BVDV strains in modified live virus vaccines and Mannheimia haemolytica bacterin-toxoid.
AB  - Seronegative persistently infected (PI) calves with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) subtype 1b were vaccinated with each of four modified live virus (MLV) BVDV vaccines and a Mannheimia haemolytica bacterin-toxoid. Nasal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were collected for virus isolation and serums were collected after vaccination and tested for BVDV1a, BVDV1b, BVDV2, bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (PI-3V), and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) antibodies. M. haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida antibodies were detected using ELISA procedures. None of the PI calves developed mucosal disease (MD) after MLV vaccination. None of the BVDV PI calves seroconverted to BVDV1b after MLV vaccination. Calves receiving MLV vaccines seroconverted to the respective type/subtype in the vaccine. Calves receiving a MLV vaccine with noncytopathic (NCP) BVDV1 (subtype not designated) did not seroconvert to BVDV1a, BVDV1b, or BVDV2. The PI calves were positive for BVDV subtype 1b, in the PBL and nasal swabs throughout the study. Calves receiving each of three vaccines with known BVDV1a strains had BVDV1a positive samples after vaccination, in some but not all calves, up to Day 28. The PI BVDV1b calves did not respond with increased M. haemolytica antibodies after vaccination compared to BVDV negative calves receiving the same M. haemolytica vaccine.
TI  - Effects of aerosolized dust in goats on lung clearance of Pasteurella and Mannheimia species.
AB  - The objective was to determine whether the inhalation of large quantities of feedyard dust predisposed the animals to pulmonary bacterial proliferation. Two control groups, C1 and C2, did not receive dust treatments, and two principal groups (P1 and P2) received a total of 14 dust treatments each. The C1 and P1 groups of goats each received a transthoracic challenge of live Mannheimia haemolytica (4 x 10(6) colony forming units, CFU) The C2 and P2 groups of goats each received a transthoracic challenge of live Pasteurella multocida (1.0 x 10(6) CFU/goat). The results showed that dusted animals had fever when compared with non-dusted controls. In addition, dusted animals demonstrated a leukocytosis with neutrophilia after the first dust treatment that was not sustainable. Finally, dusted animals demonstrated pulmonary clearance of two potential bacterial pathogens that was not significantly different from that shown by control (not dusted) animals.
TI  - PCR-detection of Hemophilus paragallinarum, Hemophilus somnus, Mannheimia (Pasteurella) hemolytica, Mannheimia spp., Pasteurella trehalosi, and Pasteurella multocida.
AB  
TI  - Coinfection with BHV-1 modulates cell adhesion and invasion by P. multocida and Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica.
AB  - Viruses are thought to facilitate bacterial infections of the respiratory tract.  The present study shows the effect of BHV-1 on Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica adherence and invasion of MDBK cells. The virus-infected MDBK cells become more susceptible to the adherence of both species of Pasteurella. The observed adherence increase depends on the length of virus pre-incubation time and on virus concentration. When MDBK cells are not infected with virus, they are only invaded by P. multocida, while M. haemolytica is not able to penetrate. The viral infection favours also the invasion by M. haemolytica.
TI  - Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) 1b: predominant BVDV subtype in calves with respiratory disease.
AB  - The prevalence of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infections was determined in 2 groups of stocker calves with acute respiratory disease. Both studies used calves assembled after purchase from auction markets by an order buyer and transported to feedyards, where they were held for approximately 30 d. In 1 study, the calves were mixed with fresh ranch calves from a single ranch. During the studies, at day 0 and at weekly intervals, blood was collected for viral antibody testing and virus isolation from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs), and nasal swabs were taken for virus isolation. Samples from sick calves were also collected. Serum was tested for antibodies to bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), BVDV1a, 1b, and 2, parainfluenza 3 virus (PI3V), and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV). The lungs from the calves that died during the studies were examined histopathologically, and viral and bacterial isolation was performed on lung homogenates. BVDV was isolated from calves in both studies; the predominant biotype was noncytopathic (NCP). Differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid sequencing showed the predominant subtype to be BVDV1b in both studies. In 1999, NCP BVDV1b was detected in numerous samples over time from 1 persistently infected calf; the calf did not seroconvert to BVDV1a or BVDV2. In both studies, BVDV was isolated from the serum, PBLs, and nasal swabs of the calves, and in the 1999 study, it was isolated from lung tissue at necropsy. BVDV was demonstrated serologically and by virus isolation to be a contributing factor in respiratory disease. It was isolated more frequently from sick calves than healthy calves, by both pen and total number of calves. BVDV1a and BVDV2 seroconversions were related to sickness in selected pens and total number of calves. In the 1999 study, BVDV-infected calves were treated longer than noninfected calves (5.643 vs 4.639 d; P = 0.0902). There was a limited number of BVDV1a isolates and, with BVDV1b used in the virus neutralization test for antibodies in seroconverting calves' serum, BVDV1b titers were higher than BVDV1a titers. This study indicates that BVDV1 strains are involved in acute respiratory disease of calves with pneumonic Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida disease. The BVDV2 antibodies may be due to cross-reactions, as typing of the BVDV strains revealed BVDV1b or la but not BVDV2. The BVDV1b subtype has considerable implications, as, with 1 exception, all vaccines licensed in the United States contain BVDV1a, a strain with different antigenic properties. BVDV1b potentially could infect BVDV1a-vaccinated calves.
TI  - Evaluation of health status of calves and the impact on feedlot performance: assessment of a retained ownership program for postweaning calves.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate animal health status at entry to a feedlot against feedlot performance and carcass value. There were 24 herds represented by 417 calves in a retained ownership program. The health status at entry was represented by the levels of serum antibody to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), bovine viral diarrhea viruses 1 and 2 (BVDV1a, BVDV2), parainfluenza 3 virus (PI3V), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), Mannheimia haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida, as well as by the presence of virus in nasal swabs and blood leukocytes and the presence of bacteria in nasal swabs. The presence or absence of viruses or bacteria at entry did not predict subsequent illness. However, there were predictors of illness severity (number of treatments) and performance parameters of feedlot performance. Herds with a low morbidity rate had higher levels of BVDV1a antibodies than herds with a high morbidity rate. On both an individual-animal and a herd-average basis, calves with low levels of antibody to BVDV1a and BVDV2 had increased total treatment costs. Also, for individual animals and the herd as a whole, low levels of antibody to P. multocida, BVDV1a, and BVDV2 were related to decreased net value to owner (carcass value minus total feedlot cost). Calves treated twice or more had lower levels of antibody to BVDV1a than those treated once or not at all. Differences in herd morbidity rate and treatment costs were more related to appropriate timing of vaccine (last dose at or near delivery of calf) or lack of a 2nd dose of killed vaccine. This was best illustrated by the levels of antibody to BVDV1a. The results of this study were used to formulate recommendations for the subsequent year.
TI  - Dose determination and confirmation for ceftiofur crystalline-free acid administered in the posterior aspect of the ear for control and treatment of bovine respiratory disease.
AB  - Three studies were conducted to determine and confirm the effective dosage rate of ceftiofur crystalline-free acid sterile suspension (CCFA-SS, 200 mg ceftiofur equivalents [CE]/ml), a long-acting ceftiofur formulation, for control and treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). In each study, CCFA-SS was administered once by subcutaneous (SC) injection in the middle third of the posterior aspect of the ear. Study 1 was conducted using an intratracheal challenge with Mannheimia (formerly Pasteurella) haemolytica and dosages ranging from 0 to 8.8 mg CE/kg to select a dosage for further field testing. In Study 2, a single dose of CCFA-SS at 0.0, 4.4, or 6.6 mg CE/kg was administered when uniform clinical signs of BRD were present in feedlot cattle. Study 3 was conducted in several feedlots to evaluate the efficacy, practicality, and safety of CCFA-SS at 4.4 or 6.6 mg CE/kg compared with a placebo control or tilmicosin for preemptive control of BRD. In Study 1, the effective dose was determined to be 5.35 mg CE/kg; therefore, 4.4 and 6.6 mg CE/kg were selected as the dosages for further field testing. Administration of CCFA-SS at 4.4 or 6.6 mg CE/kg improved treatment success compared with negative controls (P < or =.05 for both doses) in Study 2. In Study 3, a single administration of 4.4 or 6.6 mg CE/kg was comparable to tilmicosin (P <.001) and was significantly better than placebo (P <.001) for the control of BRD. Using the ear as an administration site was acceptable under field conditions and was well tolerated by all animals. These studies demonstrated that a single administration of CCFA-SS by SC injection in the middle third of the posterior aspect of the ear at 4.4 or 6.6 mg CE/kg is effective, safe, and practical for preemptive control and treatment of the bacterial component of BRD in feedlot cattle. Administration in an inedible tissue results in a short withdrawal time and no injection-site trimming at slaughter.
TI  - [Consequences of short term fluctuations of the environmental temperatures in calves--Part 2: Effects on the health status of animals within three weeks after exposure].
AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine consequences of sudden changes in ambient temperature over a 4-hour period (see part 1 [ELMER & REINHOLD, 2002]) on respiratory health in clinically healthy calves. Therefore, the relationship between short-term changes in ambient temperature and the occurrence of clinical respiratory disease was checked over a period of 3 weeks after exposure in 10 calves exposed to 5 degrees C, in 9 calves exposed to 35 degrees C and in 8 control calves (kept at 18-20 degrees C). Within the period beginning 3 days before exposure and lasting until up to 21 days after exposure, each calf was examined clinically. Rectal temperature and respiratory rate were measured daily. All calves were euthanised on day 21 after exposure. Macroscopically visible pneumonic lesions were evaluated using a semiquantitative system. Tissue samples from tonsils, bronchi, trachea, lung and mediastinal lymph nodes were examined bacteriologically. In contrast to non-exposed control calves, severe respiratory illness was observed in individual calves of both exposed groups (5 degrees C, 35 degrees C). Significant increases in body temperature, respiratory rate and animal losses (2 calves died in the group exposed to 5 degrees C, one calf died in the group exposed to 35 degrees C) were the main clinical findings. At necropsy (3 weeks after exposure), no pneumonic lesions were observed in control calves--despite the fact that this group had the highest microbiological colonisation rates in tonsils and in large airways, i.e. trachea and bronchi, within all groups. However, variable pneumonic lung lesions were seen in remaining calves exposed to cold or warm air (5 degrees C, 35 degrees C). The microbiological examination confirmed that mainly Mycoplasma spp. were identified in the lung tissue of calves exposed to 5 degrees C while Pasteurella multocida and/or Mannheimia haemolytica were the only germs found in the lung tissue of calves exposed to 35 degrees C. The results of parts 1 and 2 of the present study related to health issues of calves should be taken into account for future legislation on animal welfare.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - Prevalence of a novel capsule-associated lipoprotein among pasteurellaceae pathogenic in animals.
AB  - Capsular serotype A strains of Pasteurella multocida of avian origin express a 40-kDa lipoprotein (Plp-40) thought to attach the extracellular polysaccharide to the cell surface. The objective of the present study was to assess the prevalence of Plp-40 in P. multocida strains of disparate serotypes and host origins, as well as other pathogenic members of the family Pasteurellaceae. Exponential-phase reference and clinical isolates were radiolabeled with [3H]-palmitate, lysed to obtain whole-cell protein fractions, and analyzed using SDS-PAGE and fluorography to assess lipoprotein content. The ability to produce Plp-40 was found to be conserved among certain P. multocida reference and clinical strains of different host origins including avian, human, porcine, bovine, feline, canine, ovine, and cervine, but not rabbit. Production of a 40-kDa lipoprotein was exhibited by all clinical isolates of Pasteurella aerogenes, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Actinobacillus suis, Actinobacillus suis-like organism, and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae examined, but not Pasteurella (Mannheimia) haemolytica, Actinobacillus lignieresii, or Haemophilus spp. These data suggest that, while not all Pasteurellaceae are able to produce a 40-kDa lipoprotein under the present experimental conditions, expression is somewhat conserved among diverse isolates of disparate host origins.
TI  - Studies on the production of quorum-sensing signal molecules in Mannheimia haemolytica A1 and other Pasteurellaceae species.
AB  - The bioluminescence assay system using Vibrio harveyi reporter strains were used  to examine quorum-sensing autoinducer (AI) activity from Mannheimia haemolytica A1 cell-free culture supernatant. We showed that M. haemolytica A1 cell-free culture supernatant contains molecules that can stimulate the quorum-sensing system that regulates the expression of the luciferase operon in V. harveyi. Specifically, M. haemolytica A1 can stimulate only the quorum system 2 but not system 1, suggesting that the culture supernatant only contains molecules similar to AI-2 of V. harveyi. The bioluminescence assay was also used to show that culture supernatants from related Pasteurellaceae organisms, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella trehalosi, Actinobacillus suis and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, also contain AI-2-like molecules. This is consistent with the presence of a luxS homolog in the genomes of P. multocida and A. pleuropneumoniae. A luxS homolog was cloned by PCR from M. haemolytica A1 using sequencing data from the ongoing genome sequencing project. The cloned luxS(M.h.) was able to complement AI-2 production in the Escherichia coli DH5alpha luxS mutant. This is the first report of a quorum-sensing activity in M. haemolytica A1 and suggests that this bacterium utilizes this mechanism to regulate expression of genes under specific conditions.
TI  - Health and performance of young dairy calves vaccinated with a modified-live Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida vaccine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the health and performance of young dairy calves vaccinated with a commercial Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida vaccine. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. ANIMALS: 358 Holstein dairy calves between 14 and 20 days of age on 8 farms. PROCEDURE: Calves were randomly assigned to a control or vaccinated group. The vaccine used was a commercial modified-live M. haemolytica and P. multocida vaccine that was administered on days 0 and 14. Calf weight was measured on day 0 and monthly for 3 months. Farmers were asked to record any treatment given to the calves and the reason for treatment during the 4 months of the study. Blood was collected from all calves on days 0 and 28, and titers of antibodies to M. haemolytica were determined by means of direct bacterial agglutination. RESULTS: Mean daily gain was not significantly different between vaccinated and control calves. Vaccinated calves had a significantly greater increase in antibody titers (5.3-fold increase), compared with control calves (3.6-fold increase). There was no significant difference between vaccinated and control calves for any of the treatment outcomes (number and duration of treatments and age at first and last treatments). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that the M. haemolytica and P. multocida vaccine, given twice 2 weeks apart, was effective in increasing titers of antibodies against M. haemolytica in young dairy calves but did not improve calf performance or health.
TI  - A field comparison of the efficacy and tolerance of marbofloxacin in the treatment of bovine respiratory disease.
AB  - A multicentre, controlled, randomized and blinded trial was carried out in 180 ruminating calves with pyrexia and respiratory sign(s) on nine Belgian, British and French farms. All animals were sampled for pathogenic bacteria before treatment and at failure/relapse. Calves were injected with either marbofloxacin (M) solution [Marbocyl (Laboratoire Vetoquinol, Lure, France) 10%] at 2 mg/kg/24 h for 4 days intravenously on the first day then subcutaneously, or tilmicosin (T) solution (Micotil, Elanco Products Ltd, Basingstoke, Hants, UK) at 10 mg/kg as a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. The animals were examined clinically eight times up to day 28. The bacterial pathogens were found to be sensitive to marbofloxacin: for Pasteurella haemolytica the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90 was 0.08 microg/mL and for P. multocida the MIC90 was 0.04 microg/mL. Cure rates at day 4 for group M and group T were 84 vs. 82%, respectively (P > or = 0.05). However, overall clinical score was significantly lower after 1 day in group M (P < 0.05). There was no difference in either relapse rate or average daily weight gain between groups. Marbofloxacin was found to be better tolerated than tilmicosin at the s.c. injection site (77.5 vs. 42.2% calves without local swelling, P=0.001) and was well tolerated when injected intravenously. Marbofloxacin was shown to have comparable but faster efficacy and better local tolerance than tilmicosin in the treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD).
TI  - [The current antimicrobial resistance situation in Swiss veterinary medicine].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight Swiss laboratories from May 1999 to February 2000. Using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Haemophilus parasuis, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococci, and enterococci. Differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in E. coli and salmonella. Some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. A significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. This includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in E. coli. A similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic acid. Staphylococci from dogs (S. intermedius and S. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. Finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in Switzerland is relatively favorable.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance genes in isolates of Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mannheimia glucosida and Mannheimia varigena from bovine and swine respiratory disease: intergeneric spread of the tet(H) plasmid pMHT1.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant isolates of Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia spp. from respiratory diseases in cattle and swine were investigated for the classes of tet gene and their chromosomal or plasmid location. The 34 isolates comprised eight P. multocida, 23 Mannheimia haemolytica, two Mannheimia varigena and a single Mannheimia glucosida isolate. Identification of the tet genes was achieved by PCR analysis and hybridization with specific probes. Transformation and hybridization experiments served to confirm the plasmid location of tet genes. Selected tet genes and their adjacent regions were sequenced. The tet genes tet(B), tet(G) and tet(H) were detected. The gene tet(H) was present in 26 isolates. The 4.4 kb tet(H)-carrying plasmid pMHT1 was detected in six isolates representing all four species. In the remaining 28 isolates, copies of tet(B), tet(G) and tet(H) were identified as chromosomal. No correlation between the tet gene type and the MIC of tetracycline, or between the number of tet gene copies and the MIC of tetracycline was observed. Tetracycline resistance in P. multocida and Mannheimia spp. is mediated by at least three different tet genes. A new type of tet(H)- carrying plasmid, pMHT1, was identified. The detection of pMHT1 in M. glucosida and M. varigena is the first report of resistance plasmids in isolates of these two species. For the first time, tet(G) genes were detected in members of the family Pasteurellaceae.
TI  - Bacteremia associated with naturally occuring acute coliform mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of bacteremia in dairy cows with naturally  occurring acute coliform mastitis (ACM) with a wide range of disease severity. DESIGN: Cohort study. ANIMALS: 144 dairy cows with ACM from 6 herds. PROCEDURE: Cows were examined at time of identification of ACM (time 0) and classified as having mild, moderate, or severe mastitis on the basis of rectal temperature, hydration status, rumen contraction rate, and attitude. Cows were reexamined at 24 or 48 hours. Bacteriologic culturing of milk and blood (30 ml), CBC, and serum biochemical analysis were performed at each time point. Appropriate samples were obtained at a single point from herdmates without mastitis (controls) that were closely matched for lactation number and days since parturition. Blood culture results were compared among severity groups and controls by use of chi2 tests, as was outcome of an ACM episode for cows grouped by blood bacterial isolates. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated from 52 blood samples from 46 of 144 (32%) cows with ACM, which was significantly more than control cows (11/156; 7.1%). Group-1 isolates (Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium) were identified in 20 of 144 (14%) cows with ACM and 0 of 156 control cows. Group-1 isolates were identified in 4.3, 9.1, and 42% of cows classified as having mild, moderate, and severe ACM, respectively. Escherichia coli and K pneumoniae milk and blood isolates obtained from the same cow were of the same genotype. Bacillus spp were identified in 21 of 144 (15%) cows with ACM, which was significantly more than control cows (3/156; 1.9%). Thirty-five percent of cows with a group-1 isolate died during the mastitis episode. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that bacteremia develops in a substantial proportion of cows with ACM. Classification of severity of disease is important for establishment of effective treatment protocols; parenteral antimicrobial treatment may be indicated in cows with ACM.
TI  - [Pneumonia in calves: characterization of the bacterial spectrum and the resistance patterns to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - The population under study included young calves with pneumonia (group A, n = 13) and their controls (group B, n = 9), as well as older calves from which the lungs with (group C, n = 90) or without (group D, n = 10) lesions were collected after slaughter. Arcanobacterium pyogenes was the organism most commonly isolated from calves in group A (46%), followed by Haemophilus somnus (23%), Mannheimia haemolytica (15%), Streptococcus suis and Pasteurella multocida (7.7% each). Only S. suis (22%) and P. multocida (11%) were found in group B. P. multocida was isolated from 32% group C calves, H. somnus from 11%, A. pyogenes from 7.8%, M. haemolytica from 2.2% and S. suis from 1.1%. No specific pathogens were isolated in group D. Prevalence of Mycoplasma bovis infection was 69% in group A and 37% in group C. Ninety-eight strains were tested for resistAnce to antibiotics. Resistance to penicillin and ampicillin was present only in M. haemolytica (46%). High percentages of resistant strains were observed for streptomycin (48-100%), tetracycline (15-43%), sulfonamides alone (14-100%) or in combination with trimethoprim (0-100%). Therapeutic approaches to bacterial calf pneumonia in the area under study should be modified according to the isolated bacterial population, the observed antimicrobial resistances and the growing importance of Mycoplasma bovis.
TI  - Evaluation of ewe vaccination as a tool for increasing bighorn lamb survival following pasteurellosis epizootics.
AB  - We conducted field and laboratory experiments to evaluate whether treating pregnant bighorn ewes with a combination of an experimental Pasteurella trehalosi and Mannheimia haemolytica (formerly P. haemolytica) vaccine and a commercially-available bovine P. multocida and M. haemolytica vaccine would increase lamb survival following a pneumonia epidemic. Three free-ranging bighorn herds affected by pasteurellosis outbreaks between November 1995 and June 1996 were included in the field experiment. Post-epidemic lamb survival was low in all three herds in 1996, with November lamb:ewe ratios of < or = 8:100. In March 1997, thirty-six ewes (12/herd) were captured and radiocollared. Half of the ewes captured in each herd were randomly selected to receive both vaccines; the other half were injected with 0.9% saline solution as controls. Lambs born to radiocollared ewes were observed two or more times per week and were considered to have survived if they were alive in October 1997, about 6 mo after birth. Lamb survival differed among herds (range 22% to 100%), and survival of lambs born to vaccinated ewes was lower (P = 0.08) than survival of lambs born to unvaccinated ewes. Bronchopneumonia (pasteurellosis) was the dominant cause of mortality among lambs examined. We concurrently evaluated vaccine effects on survival of lambs born to seven captive ewes removed from the wild during the 1995-96 epidemic. Antibody titers were high in captive ewes prior to vaccination, and vaccines failed to enhance antibody titers in treated captive ewes. None of the captive-born lambs survived. These data suggest that, using existing technology, vaccinating bighorn ewes following pneumonia epidemics has little chance of increasing neonatal survival and population recovery.
TI  - Coronavirus and Pasteurella infections in bovine shipping fever pneumonia and Evans' criteria for causation.
AB  - Respiratory tract infections with viruses and Pasteurella spp. were determined sequentially among 26 cattle that died during two severe epizootics of shipping fever pneumonia. Nasal swab and serum samples were collected prior to onset of the epizootics, during disease progression, and after death, when necropsies were performed and lung samples were collected. Eighteen normal control cattle also were sampled at the beginning of the epizootics as well as at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. Respiratory bovine coronaviruses (RBCV) were isolated from nasal secretions of 21 and 25 cattle before and after transport. Two and 17 cattle nasally shed Pasteurella spp. before and after transport, respectively. RBCV were isolated at titers of 1 x 10(3) to 1.2 x 10(7) PFU per g of lung tissue from 18 cattle that died within 7 days of the epizootics, but not from the lungs of the remaining cattle that died on days 9 to 36. Twenty-five of the 26 lung samples were positive for Pasteurella spp., and their CFU ranged between 4.0 x 10(5) and 2.3 x 10(9) per g. Acute and subacute exudative, necrotizing lobar pneumonia characterized the lung lesions of these cattle with a majority of pneumonic lung lobes exhibiting fibronecrotic and exudative changes typical of pneumonic pasteurellosis, but other lung lobules had histological changes consisting of bronchiolitis and alveolitis typical of virus-induced changes. These cattle were immunologically naive to both infectious agents at the onset of the epizootics, but those that died after day 7 had rising antibody titers against RBCV and Pasteurella haemolytica. In contrast, the 18 clinically normal and RBCV isolation-negative cattle had high hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titers to RBCV from the beginning, while their antibody responses to P. haemolytica antigens were delayed. Evans' criteria for causation were applied to our findings because of the multifactorial nature of shipping fever pneumonia. This analysis identified RBCV as the primary inciting cause in these two epizootics. These viruses were previously not recognized as a causative agent in this complex respiratory tract disease of cattle.
TI  - Role of Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica and Salmonella typhimurium porins on inducible nitric oxide release by murine macrophages.
AB  - The aim of this study was to verify whether Pasteurella haemolytica, P. multocida and Salmonella typhimurium porins could affect the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) release by murine resident peritoneal macrophages in vitro. We also compared their effect with that elicited by P. haemolytica, P. multocida and S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS) whose biological activity is well known. Variations in NO release and iNOS mRNA expression due to variable concentrations of porins were recorded and compared. We also investigated the synergism between bacterial products and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). With this aim cells were incubated with porins together with murine rIFN-gamma prior to assessing the presence of NO in the supernatant and mRNA analysis. Porins in themselves were not able to induce NO release by resident peritoneal macrophages. Incubation of macrophages with IFN-gamma in the presence of porins increased NO release, whereas incubation in the presence of the arginine analog N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMA) inhibited NO release. The greatest NO release was obtained using porins at a concentration of 5 microg/mL. Porins, together with IFN-gamma, were also able to upregulate the mRNA expression of iNOS. Our findings suggest that gram-negative porins are able to modulate inflammatory and immunological responses by affecting the release of NO and the expression of iNOS gene in activated macrophages.
TI  - Apx toxins in Pasteurellaceae species from animals.
AB  - Pasteurellaceae species particularly of porcine origin which are closely related  to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae were analyzed for the presence of analogues to the major A. pleuropneumoniae RTX toxin genes, apxICABD, apxIICA and apxIIICABD and for their expression. Actinobacillus suis contains both apxICABD(var.suis) and apxIICA(var. suis) operons and was shown to produce ApxI and ApxII toxin. Actinobacillus rossii contained the operons apxIICA(var.rossii) and apxIIICABD(var.rossii). However, only the toxin ApxII and not ApxIII could be detected in cultures of A. rossii. The Apx toxins found in A. suis and A. rossi may play a role in virulence of these pathogens. Actinobacillus lignieresii, which was included since it is phylogenetically very closely related to A. pleuropneumoniae, was found to contain a full apxICABD(var.lign.) operon which however lacks the -35 and -10 boxes in the promoter sequences. As expected from these results, no expression of ApxI was detected in A. lignieresii grown under standard culture conditions. Actinobacillus seminis, Actinobacillus equuli, Pasteurella aerogenes, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis, and also Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica, which is known to secrete leukotoxin, were all shown to be devoid of any of the apx toxin genes and did not produce ApxI, ApxII or ApxIII toxin proteins. However, proteins of slightly lower molecular mass than ApxI, ApxII and ApxIII which showed limited cross-reactions with monospecific, polyclonal anti-ApxI, anti-ApxII and anti-ApxIII were detected on immunoblot analysis of A. equuli, A. seminis and P. aerogenes. The presence of Apx toxins and proteins that imunologically cross react with Apx toxins in porcine Actinobacillus species other than A. pleuropneumoniae can be expected to interfere with serodiagnosis of porcine pleuropneumonia.
TI  - Isolation of respiratory bovine coronavirus, other cytocidal viruses, and Pasteurella spp from cattle involved in two natural outbreaks of shipping fever.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify cytocidal viruses and Pasteurella spp that could be isolated from cattle involved in 2 natural outbreaks of shipping fever. ANIMALS: 105 and 120 castrated male 4- to 8-month-old feedlot cattle involved in 1997 and 1998 outbreaks, respectively. PROCEDURES: Nasal swab specimens and blood samples were collected, and cattle were vaccinated on arrival at an order-buyer barn from 4 local auction houses. Four days later, they were transported to a feedlot, and additional nasal swab specimens and blood samples were collected. Nasal swab specimens were submitted for virus isolation and bacterial culture; blood samples were submitted for measurement of respiratory bovine coronavirus (RBCV) hemagglutinin inhibition titers. RESULTS: 93 of 105 cattle and 106 of 120 cattle developed signs of respiratory tract disease during 1997 and 1998, respectively, and RBCV was isolated from 81 and 89 sick cattle, respectively, while at the order-buyer's barn or the day after arrival at the feedlot. During the 1997 outbreak, bovine herpesvirus 1 was isolated from 2 cattle at the order-buyer's barn and from 5 cattle 7 and 14 days after arrival at the feedlot, and parainfluenza virus 3 was isolated from 4 cattle 14 days after arrival at the feedlot. During the 1998 outbreak, bovine herpesvirus 1 was isolated from 2 cattle at the order-buyer's barn and on arrival at the feedlot and from 5 cattle 7 and 14 days after arrival at the feedlot, and parainfluenza virus 3 was isolated from 1 animal the day of, and from 18 cattle 7 and 14 days after, arrival at the feedlot. Pasteurella spp was cultured from 4 and 6 cattle at the order-buyer's barn and from 92 and 72 cattle on arrival at the feedlot during the 1997 and 1998 outbreaks, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that RBCV may play a causative role in outbreaks of shipping fever in cattle. More than 80% of the sick cattle shed RBCV at the beginning of 2 outbreaks when the Pasteurella spp infection rate was low.
TI  - [In vitro activity of 12 antibiotics used in veterinary medicine against Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida isolated from calves in the Netherlands].
AB  - Results of susceptibility tests of clinical isolates of animal pathogens are periodically summarized and reported by the Animal Health Service. However, these results are based upon qualitative test methods. In the present paper results of quantitative susceptibility tests of twelve antibacterial agents against Mannheimia haemolytica (MHA) and Pasteurella multocida (PMU) isolated from Dutch calves in 1996 and 1997 are presented. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of amoxicillin, ceftiofur, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, tilmicosin, neomycin, gentamicin, spectinomycin, flumequine, enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol and florfenicol were determined. No resistance was detected for ceftiofur and florfenicol. Three strains had an intermediate susceptibility to tilmicosin. The resistance percentages of MHA and PMU for neomycin, gentamicin, spectinomycin, flumequine, enrofloxacin, and chloramphenicol varied from 2% to 16%. Higher resistance percentages (16%-53%) were observed for amoxicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. The MIC breakpoints used to determine whether a strain is susceptible, intermediate, or resistant are arbitrary and discussed in this paper.
TI  - Immunogenicity of antigens in boiled alginate microspheres.
AB  - Vaccine efficacy can be enhanced by delivery of antigens in synthetic microspheres. The process of antigen incorporation into microspheres can expose fragile antigens to damaging conditions, such as high temperatures, and to bacterial contamination. Maintenance of immunogenicity of several antigens and reduction of bacterial load in alginate microspheres following boiling was evaluated. Mice were immunized subcutaneously, initially and again 21 days later, with either non-boiled or boiled microspheres containing ovalbumin (OVA), a culture supernatant vaccine of Pasteurella haemolytica (PHV), or a potassium thiocyanate extract of P. multocida (PTE). Serum samples were obtained prior to immunization and at the time of euthanasia 28 days later. Culture of microspheres showed that boiling completely eliminated aerobic bacterial growth for OVA-containing microspheres, and reduced growth by a factor of 10(4) for PTE microspheres. More bacteria were cultured after boiling than before for PHV microspheres. ELISA performed on serum and intestinal lamina propria explant supernatants showed that immunogenicity of PHV microspheres was not altered by boiling. Boiled OVA microspheres were still able to stimulate a significant serum IgG anti-OVA titer in mice, but boiled PTE microspheres completely lacked immunogenicity. Elispot assays of spleens showed that only PHV microspheres were able to retain immunogenicity after boiling. Results indicate that boiling is not an effective means for reducing the bacterial load of alginate microspheres and that the process is associated with a diminution of vaccine immunogenicity.
TI  - Use of a polymerase chain reaction method to detect the leukotoxin gene lktA in biogroup and biovariant isolates of Pasteurella haemolytica and P trehalosi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Pasteurella haemolytica and P trehalosi isolates  possess the structural gene for Pasteurella leukotoxin lktA and whether beta-hemolytic activity of these isolates correlated with detection of the lktA gene. SAMPLE POPULATION: 147 P haemolytica isolates from 21 biovariant groups and 101 P trehalosi isolates from 7 biovariant groups. In addition, P multocida and organisms from 7 other genera were tested to establish specificity of the procedure. PROCEDURE: Isolates were observed for beta-hemolysis. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure was used to amplify the RTX domain of the Pasteurella lktA gene. RESULTS: The lktA gene was detected in 108 (44%) isolates, including 15 associated with respiratory tract disease. All but 2 (98%) of the isolates that had the lktA gene were beta-hemolytic when grown on sheep blood agar. The remaining 140 isolates were negative for the lktA gene and hemolytic activity. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Hemolytic activity of P haemolytica and P trehalosi isolates correlated with detection of the lktA gene for all but 2 isolates. However, 56% of isolates tested were negative for the lktA gene and beta-hemolytic activity. Leukotoxin production and secretion is a major virulence factor when other conditions are favorable for disease development. Therefore, identification of strains that possess the lktA gene may aid in the evaluation of the pathogenic potential of Pasteurella strains carried by wild and domestic animals.
TI  - [Investigation of outer membrane proteins of Pasteurella. 2: Iron-regulated outer membrane proteins of Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica].
AB  - Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica produce specific proteins in the outer membrane under iron-depleted conditions. Pasteurella multocida serovar A expresses these proteins of molecular masses of 76 and 96 kDa as determined by electrophoresis. The analogous serovar D produces a further iron-regulated protein of 85 kDa. The Pasteurella haemolytica strains of serovar A1, A6 and T contain iron-regulated outer membrane proteins of molecular masses of 71, 77 and 100 kDa. These proteins possess binding positions for iron ions. Both Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica strains utilize iron from porcine and bovine transferrin, but not from haemin and haemoglobin.
TI  - [Long-chain fatty acids of Pasteurella multocida nad Pasteurella haemolytica].
AB  - The relative contents of long-chain fatty acids in P. multocida and P. haemolytica were investigated. A dependence on the composition of the broth was established. Accordingly, comparative quantitative studies on fatty acid contents have to be conducted using bacteria grown with the same lot of broth medium. As for P. multocida, there were significant differences between the serovars (C14 in TDHM and C16, delta 2C18 in BPL). These differences are, however, not significant to replace serotyping. Highly significant differences were also detected between P. multocida isolates from nasal swabs and pneumonic lungs (interims of C14, delta C16 on BPL and BRU). The largest differences were measured for strains grown on BRU, which is interpreted as an expression of virulence. Significant differences were found between biotypes A and T of P. haemolytica, namely for C14, C16 in TDHM, and C14, delta C16, C16, C18 in BPL medium.
TI  - [Resistance of bovine and porcine Pasteurella to florfenicol and other antibiotics].
AB  - The resistance pattern of 221 (89 bovine, 132 porcine) pasteurella strains isolated in 1996 against 16 antibiotics or chemotherapeutics was determined by agar diffusion. Pasteurella haemolytica showed a higher level of resistance compared to Pasteurella multocida; porcine strains were more resistant than bovine strains. Over 90% of porcine Pasteurella multocida were sensible to penicillin G, ampicillin, cephalothin, polymyxin B, enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol and florfenicol. In addition, bovine strains were at least 90% sensible to oxacillin, erythromycin, gentamycin and sulfmethoxazole-trimethoprim. More than 90% of porcine Pasteurella haemolytica were classified as sensible to polymyxin B, enrofloxacin und florfenicol; bovine strains to cephalothin, neomycin und chloramphenicol as well. In 1996, 2 years after the chloramphenicol ban for food rendering animals, only 6.3% of bovine pasteurella strains proved to be resistant against chloramphenicol compared to a 16.27% fraction in 1994. The mean MIC-values of florfenicol against pasteurella spp. were nearly the same in bovine and porcine isolates with 0.53 microgram/ml and 0.52 microgram/ml respectively. Pasteurella haemolytica, however, showed higher MIC-values (0.68 microgram/ml in bovine, 0.70 microgram/ml in porcine isolates) than Pasteurella multocida with 0.47 microgram/ml in bovine and 0.51 microgram/ml in porcine strains. No isolate had a MIC of florfenicol greater than 1.0 microgram/ml, all pasteurella strains were classified sensible to florfenicol.
TI  - In vivo production of neuraminidase by Pasteurella haemolytica in market stressed cattle after natural infection.
AB  - Pasteurella haemolytica (Ph) is the most important cause of the bovine acute fibrinohemorrhagic pneumonia that occurs in market stressed calves after shipment to feedyards. Recent characterization of neuraminidase production by these organisms has shown that all 16 serotypes produce an immunologically similar form of the enzyme. Anti-neuraminidase antibody against PhA1 and PhA6 was determined in 101 2- to 5-month-old calves, on their farms of origin, at the order buyer barn (OBB), and through 28 days in the feedyard. Half of the calves were vaccinated with a killed Ph serotype-A1 (PhA1) product. Nasal secretion and tonsil wash specimens were cultured for Ph and Pasteurella multocida (Pm). Serum antibody against PhA1 and PhA6 was measured by indirect hemagglutination (IHA), and anti-neuraminidase antibody was determined by the neutralization assay. At the feedyard, 73 calves had respiratory tract disease. IHA values ranged between 1:2 and 1:1024 for PhA1 and between 1:2 and 1:512 for Ph serotype A6 (PhA6). Forty-two, 24, and 28% of the calves were infected with PhA1, PhA6, and Pm, respectively. Ninety-six percent of the calves experienced an increase in anti-PhA1 neuraminidase antibody when sera drawn on feedyard day 28 were compared with sera drawn on the farm. These data demonstrate that the enzyme neuraminidase is produced in vivo in market stressed cattle after a natural Ph infection.
TI  - In vitro microbiological characterization of novel macrolide CP-163,505 for animal health specific use.
AB  - A novel 16-membered-ring macrolide agent (CP-163,505, a reductive amination derivative of repromicin) was identified as an antibacterial against Pasteurella haemolytica, P. multocida and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, important etiological agents of livestock respiratory disease. In vitro MIC50/90 analysis revealed that CP-163,505 was more potent (4x) than tilmicosin against P. multocida, and equivalent to tilmicosin against P. haemolytica and A. pleuropneumoniae. In time kill kinetic studies, CP-163,505 showed bactericidal activity against P. haemolytica, P. multocida and A. pleuropneumoniae and bacteriostatic activity against E. coli at 8 times its MIC. In vitro, CP-163,505 was more potent in alkaline pH (16 approximately 32 x ) and less potent in the presence of excess cations (Mg+2 and Ca+2, 4x). EDTA and PMBN increased CP-163,505 potency against E. coli (4x) but not against the other species. Similar results were obtained with erythromycin A and tilmicosin, which were used as controls. From our data, we hypothesize that Pasteurella and Actinobacillus have an outer membrane significantly different from that of the typical enteric Gram-negative bacterium E. coli.
TI  - Assessment of spatial and temporal clustering of ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistant strains of Pasteurella multocida and P haemolytica isolated from cattle in California.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistant strains of Pasteurella multocida and P haemolytica isolated from California cattle with pneumonia were spatially and temporally clustered and to compare overall estimates of percentages of these isolates resistant to these antimicrobials with estimates obtained on the basis of regional and temporal information. DESIGN: Epidemiologic study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Records of P multocida and P haemolytica isolates obtained from lung or tracheal wash samples collected from California cattle with pneumonia between July 1, 1991 and July 31, 1996. Only isolates obtained from samples submitted by dairies and calf ranches were used. PROCEDURE: Spatial clustering of ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistant isolates was assessed by use of nearest-neighbor and Cuzick and Edwards' analyses. Linear clustering along a north-south line was assessed by use of runs and maximum length of runs tests. Temporal clustering was assessed by use of scan tests. Spatial-temporal clustering was assessed by use of Barton's method. Regional estimates of percentages of P multocida and P haemolytica resistant to ampicillin or tetracycline were calculated. RESULTS: There was significant spatial clustering of resistant isolates and significant linear clustering along a north-south line. Significant differences in regional estimates of percentages of antimicrobial-resistant isolates were found. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Results support the hypothesis that antimicrobial-resistant organisms can be clustered at the local level and reinforce the need to establish regional estimates of percentages of bacterial isolates that will be susceptible to commonly used antimicrobials.
TI  - Biovariants of isolates of Pasteurella from domestic and wild ruminants.
AB  - A total of 608 bacterial isolates previously identified as Pasteurella haemolytica biotypes A and 3, P. trehalosi, and P. multocida, were separated into 73 distinct biovariants using 21 phenotypic characteristics. The largest group (54%) of wildlife isolates was identified as biogroup 2 and biogroup 2 variants. Biogroup 2 and biogroup 2 variants accounted for only 17% of isolates from domestic ruminants and were all from sheep. In contrast, 43% of isolates from domestic ruminants were identified as biogroup 1 and biogroup 1 variants, whereas only 6% of isolates from wildlife were identified in these groups. The majority of biogroup 1 isolates from wild ruminants were from 1 group of bighorn sheep in Arizona that were geographically separated from other wildlife sampled. Similarly, 1 biogroup 2 variant, 2E, was cultured only from free-ranging Dall sheep in Alaska. Twelve percent of domestic isolates and 6% of wildlife isolates were indole positive. The remaining isolates from wildlife (33%) and domestic animals (30%) were distributed among 53 distinct biovariants. None of these individual biovariants represented >4% of the total isolates. Phenotypic characterization was valuable for distinguishing between isolates from different hosts and from different geographic areas and can be used to assist in epidemiologic studies.
TI  - Biotinylated proteins of Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica cause  false-positive reactions with biotinylated probes in colony lift-hybridization assays.
AB  
TI  - Bacterial identity and characteristics in healthy and unhealthy respiratory tracts of sheep and calves.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare different bacteriological aspects of the respiratory systems of healthy (H) versus unhealthy (UH) animals with respiratory signs. The prevalence of different bacterial species was determined in the upper and lower respiratory tract of H and UH Najdi sheep, Somali sheep and Holstein calves. The characteristics of Pasteurella spp. isolates, and the biotype of Pasteurella haemolytica were identified in H and UH animals, Eighteen out of 28 (64.3%) of the identified bacterial species in the upper respiratory tract were more prevalent in the nasal cavities of UH Najdi and Somali sheep and Holstein calves with respiratory signs than in apparently healthy animals; four of the most prevalent bacteria in the upper respiratory system of UH sheep were Moraxella spp., Pseudomonas pseudomallei, Erysipelothrix spp., Pasteurella multocida, while three of the most prevalent bacteria in UH calves were Pasteurella haemolytica, Actinomyces spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The prevalence of six different bacterial species was greater in the lungs of UH animals, namely Actinomyces pyogenes, Erysipelothrix spp., P. haemolytica, Pasteurella ureae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be risk factors in the complexity of the prevalent respiratory diseases of the animals surveyed. Of the biochemical, cytological and colonial characteristics studied in the identified P. haemolytica and P. multocida, two characters were significantly different (p < 0.05) in organisms isolated from UH as compared to those from H animals. These were the higher loss of haemolytic power by the strains of P. haemolytica and the decreased fermentation of trehalose by all the strains of P. multocida recovered from healthy animals. The only biotype of P. haemolytica isolated from H animals was biotype A, while both biotypes A (88.0% of the isolates) and T (12.0% of the isolates) were recovered from UH animals.
TI  - Growth of Pasteurella haemolytica and production of its leukotoxin in semi-defined media.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop semi-defined media that support growth of the bovine pathogen, Pasteurella haemolytica, and use them to examine production of leukotoxin and an arginine-binding protein by this organism. SAMPLE POPULATION: 10 P haemolytica A1 strains and 1 P multocida strain. PROCEDURE: Bacterial strains were cultivated at 37 C in media containing various amino acids, carbon sources, vitamins, and cofactors, and absorbance (OD600) was measured. Leukotoxin and arginine-binding protein production were assessed by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: Optimal growth required supplementation with 0.1% fetal bovine serum, gelatin, or purified bovine serum albumin. Calcium pantothenate and thiamine were essential for growth, and a variety of carbon sources could be utilized. In the complete medium, 15 amino acids were included; however, in the minimal medium, no amino acids were required. All strains (except P multocida) grew in the complete medium and 7 grew well in the minimal medium. Leukotoxin was not produced when amino acids were limiting, but could be enhanced by addition of 0.2% NH4SO4. Production of the arginine-binding protein was not affected by nitrogen availability or by presence of L-arginine. CONCLUSIONS: Two media that support good growth of P haemolytica strains were developed. The minimal medium is simple to prepare and manipulate and its use revealed a potential role of nitrogen availability in the regulation of leukotoxin expression. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Creation of these media will permit continued studies of the response of P haemolytica to environmental conditions that may mimic those encountered in the bovine respiratory tract during shipping.
TI  - Association of Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Haemophilus somnus with pneumonia in calves.
AB  - Pathological and bacteriological observations were made on 100 (0.98%) pneumonic  lungs of 10140 slaughtered beef calves during March 1995-June 1996 period. Gross lesions were mainly lobular and occasionally lobar pattern and, were frequently observed in the pars cranialis of lobus cranialis dexter. In histological examination, proliferative-exudative pneumonia was observed in 79 cases, and proliferative pneumonia alone in 21 cases. In bacteriological examination, Pasteurella haemolytica. Pasteurella multocida and Haemophilus somnus were isolated from 42.8 and 10 of pneumonic lungs respectively. In 7 cases, P. haemolytica and H. somnus were isolated from the same sample P. haemolytica and P. multocida were also found in the same sample in 2 cases. There was a close relation among these organisms and exudative inflammation (P < 0.01).
TI  - Serotyping and enzyme characterization of Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida isolates recovered from pneumonic lungs of stressed feeder calves.
AB  - Ninety-one isolates of Pasteurella multocida (Pm)and 124 of Pasteurella haemolytica (Ph) were recovered from the lungs of calves that died of bovine respiratory tract disease (BRTD). Nine Pm enzyme profiles (A through I) and 9 Ph enzyme profiles (J through R) were determined for the Pasteurella isolates. The Pm isolates were relatively evenly divided among the enzyme profiles, with one exception, profile I. The Ph isolates were not evenly distributed among the profiles. Fifty of the 91 Pm isolates were serotyped. Forty-two Pm isolates were positive for capsule type A, and 8 were untypable. Five somatic type antigen profiles (3; 3,4; 3,7; 3,4,7; and 4) were identified among the 50 serotyped Pm isolates; one isolate was untypable. The Ph isolates were further divided through serotyping and grouped as follows: 74 (60%) Pasteurella haemolytica A1 (PhA1), 12 (10%) PhA2, 4 (3%) PhA5, and 34(27%) PhA6. Eighty-one percent of the Ph serotypes were clustered in the M and N enzyme profile. The P enzyme profile was almost unique to PhA2 (8 of 12, 67% of PhA2 isolates). Results of this study indicate a need to collect more data on Ph serotypes at the state veterinary diagnostic laboratories.
TI  - Validation of random amplified polymorphic DNA assays by ribotyping as tools for  epidemiological surveys of Pasteurella from animals.
AB  - Two collections of strains of Pasteurella were studied for epidemiological purposes by ribotyping and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assays. These strains were isolated through two different structures of animal productions: cattle and rabbit. Forty strains of P. haemolytica from cattle reared in independent breeding-herds belonged to only 3 ribotypes after digestion with HindIII and PvuII. No further discrimination of these strains was obtained by RAPD assays. All these 40 strains showed more than 90% of similarity. This result was consistent with the hypothesis of a clonal dissemination of these strains in bovine herds, possible favoured by the large use of antibiotics. Forty-one strains of P. multocida were isolated in rabbits flocks belonging to 16 breeders. Six of these were linked by commercial relationships. Twenty-eight out of the 29 strains isolated through this commercial network belonged to only three ribotypes whereas the 12 strains from independant breeders belonged to 9 ribotypes. Results of RAPD assays were in accordance with those of ribotyping and validate the use of RAPD assays for epidemiological studies of Pasteurella strains.
TI  - Occurrence of [copper, zinc]-cofactored superoxide dismutase in Pasteurella haemolytica and its serotype distribution.
AB  - Fifty-two ovine strains of Pasteurella haemolytica and P. trehalosi representing  serotypes 1-16 were examined for the presence of [copper, zinc]superoxide dismutase DNA sequences. This was done using a combination of polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers based on the sequence of the [Cu,Zn]superoxide dismutase gene (sodC) in related species and Southern hybridization using a fragment of sodC from P. haemolytica A2 serotype as a probe. Both detection methods identified a fragment of the sodC gene in 9/9 strains of P. haemolytica serotype 2 examined and in 5/8 strains of serotype 7. No evidence of this gene was found in any other serotype of P. haemolytica or in any P. trehalosi serotype. Comparison of DNA sequence showed near identity between sodC from the A2 and A7 serotypes of P. haemolytica and substantial similarity (70%) to sodC previously sequenced in P. multocida, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae. Analysis by gel electrophoresis of the superoxide dismutase activity present in cell lysates showed that one or more superoxide dismutase is present in all serotypes. However, cyanide-inhibitable activity, corresponding to [Cu,Zn]superoxide dismutase, was detected only in those strains of serotypes A2 and A7 which showed evidence of the sodC gene fragment.
TI  - Effect of a combination of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of respiratory  disease in cattle.
AB  - Clinical effect of the administration of thiamphenicol (TP) and tylosin (TS) on bovine respiratory disease was investigated. Group I (n = 64) were administered TP (10 mg/kg) and TS (4 mg/kg), group II (n = 26) were given TP (5 mg/kg) and TS (2 mg/kg). For the control, TP group (n = 25) were given 20 mg/kg of TP and ampicillin group (n = 23) were given 10 mg/kg of ampicillin. As a result, improvement of clinical findings was more rapid and the cure rate was significantly higher in group I compared to those in the other 3 groups. These results showed that a combination therapy with minimal basic doses of TP and TS is very effective for some respiratory diseases in cattle.
TI  - The fractional inhibitory concentration index of antimicrobial agents for bacteria and Mycoplasma isolated from the nasal swabs of cattle with respiratory diseases.
AB  - We investigated the effect of thiamphenicol plus lincomycin (TP + LCM) and thiamphenicol plus tylosin (TP + TS) combinations using checker board method on the growth of Pasteurella (P.) multocida, P. haemolytica and Mycoplasma (M.) bovis by calculating the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FIC index). The results showed that the FIC indexes of the TP + LCM combination for P. multocida, P. haemolytica and M. bovis were 0.36 +/- 0.10, 0.72 +/- 0.09 and 0.81 +/- 0.18, respectively. The FIC indexes of the TP + TS combination for P. multocida, P. haemolytica, and M. bovis were 0.79 +/- 0.20, 0.66 +/- 0.11 and 0.32 +/- 0.14, respectively. Thus, these combinations are assumed to have a more synergistic or additive effect on bacteria growth than a single antimicrobial agent.
TI  - CAT III chloramphenicol resistance in Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida isolated from calves.
AB  - Chloramphenicol, which had been used extensively for antimicrobial veterinary therapy, was prohibited in Europe in 1994. Soon after it became available, resistance to this drug was detected, generally conferred by plasmids encoding inactivating enzymes, the chloramphenicol acetyltransferases (CAT), in Gram-negative as well as in Gram-positive bacteria. In the last few years, resistance to antibiotics emerged in Pasteurella strains from breeding herds and this evolution was followed by a national surveillance network. Chloramphenicol-resistance was more recently detected in multiresistant strains. We studied 25 strains of Pasteurella, selected for their resistance to chloramphenicol. Production of a CAT was demonstrated in all these strains. PCR amplification indicated that the CAT produced was of type III for 23 of them. In these strains, chloramphenicol-resistance was mediated by plasmids of about 5.1 kb. Southern blots on restriction fragments suggested a high degree of homology between these 5.1 kb plasmids. In the two other strains, production of a CAT type I was demonstrated, and the corresponding genes were either shown on a plasmid of 17 or 5.5 kb.

TI  - Minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints and disk diffusion inhibitory zone interpretive criteria for tilmicosin susceptibility testing against Pasteurella spp. associated with bovine respiratory disease.
AB  - Tilmicosin is a novel macrolide antibiotic developed for exclusive use in veterinary medicine. The first tilmicosin-containing product was approved to treat bovine respiratory disease associated with pasteurellae. The development of antimicrobial susceptibility testing guidelines for tilmicosin was predicated on the relationship of clinical efficacy studies that demonstrated a favorable therapeutic outcome, on pharmaco-kinetic data, and on in vitro test data, as recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). The NCCLS-approved breakpoints for the MIC dilution testing are resistant > or = 32 micrograms/ml, intermediate 16 micrograms/ml, and susceptible < or = 8 micrograms/ml. The zone of inhibition interpretive criteria for disk diffusion testing with a 15-micrograms disk are resistant < or = 10 mm, intermediate 11-13 mm, and susceptible > or = 14 mm.
TI  - Distribution of tet(H) among Pasteurella isolates from the United States and Canada.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant isolates of Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica obtained from various locations in the United States and Canada were studied to determine the distribution of the tet(H) gene. Of the 31 isolates examined, 25 were found to contain the tet(H) gene. Chromosomal or plasmid DNA obtained from those that did not contain the tet(H) gene did not hybridize with probes specific for classes A through G, though chromosomal DNA from one isolate lacking tet(H) hybridized with a probe specific for class M. The tet(H) gene was found on plasmid as well as on chromosomal DNA, suggesting that it is carried on a transposable element.
TI  - [Resistance pattern of bovine Pasteurella].
AB  - The sensibility of 375 pasteurellae of bovine origin (215 pasteurella multocida--and 160 pasteurella haemolytica--strains) was examined against 16 antibiotics or chemotherapeutics by agar diffusion technique. A great part of the strains was resistant to oxacillin (41,18%), tylosin (79,14%), streptomycin (53,21%), sulfonamides (57,33%) and tetracycline (47,20%). Only a few resistant strains were found for cephalothin (5,07%), polymyxin B (0,27%) and enrofloxacin (0,53%). While 16,27% of all isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, 100% of the pasteurella strains proved to be sensible to its structural analogon florfenicol. This is affirmed by the low minimal inhibitory concentrations (0,25-1,0 micrograms/ml) of this antibiotic.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance determinants, Tet B and Tet M, detected in Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida from bovine herds.
AB  - Resistance to antibiotics has recently emerged in Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida isolated from bovine herds. Forty-two clinical strains resistant to antibiotics and isolated through a French national network from different origins were analysed for their resistance to tetracycline. The MICs of tetracycline ranged from 32-256 mg/L. The resistance determinants Tet B and Tet M were detected in two strains, in which they are probably chromosomal.
TI  - Extracellular neuraminidase production by Pasteurella species isolated from infected animals.
AB  - A total of 721 field isolates of various Pasteurella species (haemolytica, multocida, and testudinis) from various regions of the United States were examined for extracellular neuraminidase production. All strains were grown and tested in the same way. Included were 372 P. haemolytica serotype 1 isolates, 181 P. haemolytica serotype 2 isolates, 63 P. haemolytica serotype 6 isolates, 101 Pasteurella multocida isolates, and 4 Pasteurella testudinis isolates. All Pasteurella species examined produced the enzyme. The data revealed the following: (1) Several transfers of P. haemolytica strains on blood agar medium did not cause a decrease in enzyme activity. (2) P. haemolytica serotypes 2 and 6 produce more neuraminidase than P. haemolytica serotype 1, P. multocida, and P. testudinis isolates. (3) There was no apparent change in neuraminidase production by P. haemolytica serotypes 1 and 2 obtained from the same animal taken on different days in the feedyard. (4) There was no significant change in neuraminidase production by P. haemolytica serotype 2 isolates taken from the same animal at the auction market and later at the feedyard.
TI  - Extracellular neuraminidase production by a Pasteurella multocida A:3 strain associated with bovine pneumonia.
AB  - The properties of an extracellular neuraminidase produced by a Pasteurella multocida A:3 strain that was isolated in a case of bovine pneumonia were examined during growth in a defined medium. This enzyme (isolated from concentrated culture supernatants of P. multocida A:3) was active against N-acetylneuramin lactose, human alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, fetuin, colominic acid, and bovine submaxillary mucin. Enzyme elaboration was correlated with the growth of the organism in a defined medium, with maximum quantities produced in the stationary phase. The enzyme was purified by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange on DEAE-Sephacel, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The purified neuraminidase possessed a specific activity of 9.36 mumol of sialic acid released per min per mg of protein against fetuin. The enzyme possessed a pH optimum of 6.0 and a Km of 0.03 mg/ml. The P. multocida A:3 neuraminidase had a molecular weight of approximately 500,000 as estimated by gel filtration. The enzyme was stable at 4 and 37 degrees C for 3 h. Approximately 75% of the neuraminidase activity was lost within 30 min at 50 degrees C. Greater than 90% of the enzyme activity was destroyed within 10 min at temperatures of > or = 65 degrees C. The P. multocida neuraminidase does not appear to be serologically related to the Pasteurella haemolytica A1 neuraminidase since antiserum prepared against the purified P. haemolytica enzyme did not neutralize the P. multocida enzyme.
TI  - Serotypes of Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica isolated from pneumonic lesions in cattle and sheep from Mexico.
AB  - A total of 13,000 pairs of lungs were examined at Mexico's City abbatoir, where 8,000 corresponded to sheep and 5,000 to cattle. From those, 224 pneumonic lesions were observed, obtaining 97 positive isolates, which yielded 112 strains of Pasteurella sp. Forty isolates were identified as P. haemolytica and 72 as P. multocida. One-hundred percent of P. haemolytica belonged to biotype A. Serotypes were determined by indirect haemagglutination. P. multocida isolates were classified according to the acriflavine and hyaluronidase techniques, 61% belonged to type A, 25% to type D and 14% were untypified. Somatic serotypes were determined by gel immunodiffusion; serotype 3 was more frequent, in sheep 72% and in cattle 77%.
TI  - [Pasteurelloses].
AB  - According to the genetic relationships among Gram-negative bacilli the genus Pasteurella is included with the genus Haemophilus and the genus Acinobacillus within the family Pasteurellacae. Pasteurella multocida, the type species, is responsible for the majority of human Pasteurella infections. P. multocida is a member of the normal flora in the upper respiratory tract of many mammals or birds. It causes sporadic or epidemic diseases among different animal species, particularly pneumonia and atrophic rhinitis in swine in intensive breeding stations. The most common human infection with P. multocida is a local cellulitis following dog or cat bites and scratches. Serious local complications are sometimes responsible for prolonged disability. The respiratory tract is the second human source of P. multocida isolates. The frequency of recovery of P. multocida from oropharynx of apparently healthy pig breeders suggests that respiratory pasteurellosis could be an occupational disease. The mechanisms of virulence of P. multocida are unclear. Several factors are involved: capsules preventing phagocytosis, a dermonecrotic toxin causing experimental atrophic rhinitis, hyaluronidase, neuraminidase and proteases. Penicillin is considered to be the drug of choice for Pasteurella infection. Tetracyclin is efficient for bites but has no bactericidal effect. Oxacillin, first-generation cephalosporins, macrolides and aminoglycosides have poor activities. In the case of beta-lactamase producing strains a bactericidal effect could be achieved with fluoroquinolones or third generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Proposed quality control guidelines for antimicrobial susceptibility tests using  tilmicosin.
AB  - Quality control guidelines for tilmicosin, a novel veterinary-use-only macrolide, were developed in a multi-laboratory study according to established National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) procedures (M23-T2). Tilmicosin was incorporated into Sensititre plates for broth microdilution endpoint testing and into two lots of 15-micrograms disks for Kirby-Bauer agar disk diffusion testing. One common lot and five unique lots of Mueller-Hinton media were used. (Broth was cation adjusted, and agar was supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood.) Bacteria used for reference strains included Pasteurella haemolytica 128K, Pasteurella multocida ATCC 43137, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (microdilution) and ATCC 25923 (disk). Replicate tests were conducted. Disk diffusion and broth microdilution quality control ranges are proposed.
TI  - Construction of conjugative shuttle and suicide vectors for Pasteurella haemolytica and P. multocida.
AB  - A shuttle cloning vector, pAKA16, and suicide derivatives pAKA19 and pAKA22 have  been developed for gene transfer to Pasteurella haemolytica and P. multocida. pAKA16 was constructed by insertion of the lacZ alpha-peptide-encoding region and a multiple cloning site into a plasmid which was originally isolated from P. haemolytica serotype A1. The vector encodes ampicillin resistance, and contains at least 14 unique restriction sites and the property of phenotypic identification of recombinant clones in Escherichia coli by insertional inactivation of beta-galactosidase activity. It can be transferred by conjugation to P. haemolytica or P. multocida and is stably maintained in both species. The type-II chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-encoding gene (cat), cloned into pAKA16, was stably expressed in both P. haemolytica and P. multocida. Plasmids pAKA19 and pAKA22 were constructed by replacement of the origin of DNA replication (ori) of pAKA16 with a ColE1-type ori from pBR322 or an ori of plasmid R6K (oriR6K) from pJM703.1, respectively. These derivatives replicate in E. coli, but not in either P. haemolytica or P. multocida, and are suitable for use as suicide vectors for these Pasteurella species.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida isolated from pneumonic ovine lungs.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibilities of Pasteurella haemolytica biotypes A and T and P multocida from pneumonic ovine lungs to penicillin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, kanamycin, neomycin, gentamicin, streptomycin and lincomycin were determined by the disk diffusion method. All the isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol and resistant to lincomycin. The isolates of P haemolytica biotype A were consistently more sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, erythromycin and streptomycin than those of biotype T.
TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of the major protein of the outer membrane of Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 35 kDa (p35) major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of P. multocida shared a strong homology with those of homotrimeric nonspecific porins of gram-negative bacteria. The capacity of outer membrane protein (OMP) preparations of P. multocida to bind to respiratory mucosal surface preparations was inhibited significantly by using a polyclonal anti-p35 antiserum in an adhesion ELISA. Anti-p35 antiserum cross-reacted with a 44 kDa (p44) MOMP of P. haemolytica. N-terminal sequencing of MOMP p44 revealed a homology of 81% with the putative porin MOMP p35 of P. multocida.
TI  - A 4-year survey of antimicrobial susceptibility trends for isolates from cattle with bovine respiratory disease in North America.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility trends of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) pathogens isolated from 1988 to 1992 were determined. A total of 880 isolates representing Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Haemophilus somnus were used in the study. Overall, resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and sulfamethazine was frequently encountered among strains of P. haemolytica and P. multocida. Ceftiofur, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin originally marketed in 1988 for the treatment of BRD, was very active against the BRD pathogens tested; the MIC of ceftiofur for 90% of isolates tested was < or = 0.06 microgram/ml. Resistance to spectinomycin varied on the basis of the breakpoint used. Substantial variation in the year-to-year susceptibility of BRD pathogens to tilmicosin, a new macrolide antimicrobial agent, was observed. The proportion of susceptible P. haemolytica isolates ranged from 84.7% in the second year to 7.1% in the third year and 78.2% in the fourth year. Similar fluctuations were observed with strains of P. multocida.
TI  - Iron supply of Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica.
AB  - Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica do not produce hydroxamate- or  phenolate type siderophores. However, transport- and utilization systems could be detected for the well known siderophores ferrioxamine B, E, G, rhizoferrin and the intermediate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid by means of cross-feeding tests in both Pasteurella species. Enterobactin and ferrichrome did not feed any of the Pasteurella strains tested. Additionally, alpha-ketoacids and alpha-hydroxyacids such as pyruvic acid, alpha-hydroxyisovaleric acid and others acting as primary metabolites enabled growth of P. multocida and P. haemolytica under iron limitation.
TI  - [Detection of atypical toxin-producing Pasteurella strains on the nasal mucosa of calves and their differential diagnostic limits for Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida].
AB  - The bacterial colonisation on nasal mucous membranes of calves at age of 3, 5 to  5 months was investigated by cotton swabs. Three Pasteurella species were found (P. multocida subspecies multocida, P. haemolytica, P. avium) as monocausal infection as well as pluricausal infection. P. avium was characterised by colonial morphology, bacterioscopy, biochemical properties, polypeptide-pattern in SDS-PAGE and by electronmicroscopic investigation and was differentiated from P. multocida and P. haemolytica. It is very interesting, that the P. avium strains possess an antigen structure, reacting with monoclonal antibodies directed against the heat labile-toxin of P. multocida subspecies multocida.
TI  - [Evaluation of phagocytosis, bactericidal effect, and cytotoxicity of Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida in bovine alveolar macrophages].
AB  - Evaluation of phagocytosis and bactericidal effect of Pasteurella haemolytica and P. multocida was conducted on bovine alveolar macrophages freshly obtained through bronchioalveolar washings from live animals. Cytotoxic activity of these bacteria on the alveolar macrophages was evaluated through the simple visual assay in microplates, using bovine blood leukocytes as a comparative target cell. In order to evaluate phagocytosis the following variables were considered P. haemolytica and P. multocida (independently) in contact with alveolar macrophages, P. haemolytica and P. multocida in suspension as a positive control of bacterial growth, and RPMI-1640 medium alone, as a negative control of bacterial growth. To measure bactericidal capacity, bacteria were incubated with plastic adhered alveolar macrophages at 30 minutes and 3 hours intervals. Samples incubated 30 minutes were taken as phagocytosis-base readings and at the 3 h interval to evaluate bactericidal capacity of the alveolar macrophages on phagocytized bacteria. Reading of the samples of each evaluation was conducted in a spectrophotometer a 380 nm. Phagocytosis results indicated that bacterial proliferation was higher when bacteria were alone as compared when they were with alveolar macrophages (p < 0.05). Bactericidal capacity of the macrophages was efficient because bacterial numbers were higher in the first evaluation as compared to the second (p < 0.05). It was demonstrated that the cytotoxic effect of P. haemolytica was more severe on blood leukocytes as compared to alveolar macrophages (p < 0.05). There was no evidence of P. multocida cytotoxicity on the evaluated cells. With the development of this technique for the obtention of alveolar macrophages and using spectrophotometry for the phagocytosis and bactericidal effect evaluations, numerous variables and samples can be tested, such as opsonized bacteria or to measure the behaviour of alveolar macrophages infected with different agents involved in the bovine pneumonic complex.
TI  - Immunogens of Pasteurella.
AB  - The family Pasteurellaceae Pohl contains Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic and fermentative bacteria of the genera Pasteurella, Haemophilus, and Actinobacillus. Approximately 20 different species of the genus Pasteurella have been identified using phenotypic and genetic analyses. Of these species, P. multocida and P. haemolytica are the most prominent pathogens in domestic animals causing severe diseases and major economic losses in the cattle, swine, sheep, and poultry industries. Mechanisms of immunity to these bacteria have been difficult to determine, and efficacious vaccines have been a challenge to develop and evaluate. Pasteurella multocida of serogroups A and D are mainly responsible for disease in North American poultry and pigs and to a lesser extent in cattle. Fowl cholera in chickens and turkeys is caused by various serotypes of P. multocida serogroup A and characterized by acute septicemia and fibrinous pneumonia or chronic fibrinopurulent inflammation of various tissues. Current biologicals in use are live P. multocida vaccines and bacterins. Potency tests for avian P. multocida biologicals are a bacterial colony count for vaccines and vaccination and challenge of birds for bacterins. Somatic antigens, particularly lipopolysaccharide (LPS), appear to be of major importance in immunity. In North American cattle, P. multocida serogroup A is associated mainly with bronchopneumonia (enzootic pneumonia) in young calves; however, it is occasionally isolated from fibrinous pleuropneumonia of feedlot cattle (shipping fever). Biologicals currently available are modified-live vaccines and bacterins. The potency test for vaccines is bacterial colony counts. The test for bacterin potency is vaccination and challenge of mice. Important immunogens have not been well characterized for P. multocida infection in cattle. In swine, P. multocida infection is sometimes associated with pneumonia; however, its major importance is in atrophic rhinitis. A protein toxin (dermonecrotic toxin), produced by toxigenic strains of P. multocida types A and D, and concurrent infection with Bordetella bronchiseptica appear to be the major factors in development of atrophic rhinitis. Currently available biologicals are bacterins and inactivated toxins (toxoids). The toxin appears to be the major immunogen for preventing atrophic rhinitis. There are, however, no standardized requirements for potency testing of P. multocida type D toxoid. Various serotypes of P. haemolytica biotype A are responsible for severe fibrinous pleuropneumonia of cattle and sheep, occasionally septicemia of lambs, and mastitis in ewes. Several serotypes of P. haemolytica biotype T are isolated from acute septicemia of lambs. The currently available P. haemolytica biologicals are modified-live vaccines, bacterins, bacterial surface extracts, and culture supernates that contain an exotoxin (leukotoxin).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial properties of tilmicosin against Australian isolates of Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica from cattle.
AB  
TI  - Evaluation of the RapID NH system for identification of Haemophilus somnus, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae isolated from cattle and pigs with respiratory disease.
AB  - Haemophilus somnus, Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae from cattle and pigs with respiratory disease were used to evaluate the RapID NH system (Innovative Diagnostics, Atlanta, Ga.). Minor modifications of the RapID NH system to include animal source and growth requirements would permit the identification of all isolates tested.
TI  - Purification of a Pasteurella haemolytica serotype 1-specific polysaccharide epitope by use of monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity.
AB  - A murine IgM monoclonal antibody causing bacterial agglutination was used in an immunoaffinity procedure to purify a serotype 1-specific polysaccharide epitope from Pasteurella haemolytica. The P haemolytica serotype 1-specific antibody was precipitated from peritoneal ascitic fluid, dialyzed, and covalently attached to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B beads. Retention of purified antibody activity and coupling efficiency were > 99% when evaluated by ELISA, agglutination testing, and protein determination. Potassium thiocyanate was selected as an eluant on the basis of reversible dissociation of bacterial agglutination and was titrated for the lowest effective concentration. Immunobead activity was observed microscopically by immobilization of encapsulated P haemolytica serotype 1 and its reversible dissociation after elution with 0.4M potassium thiocyanate. Specificity of immobilization was visualized, using P haemolytica serotypes 2 and 5, which were not bound, and by blocking serotype-1 binding with homologous capsular material. Saline-extractable capsular material from P haemolytica serotype 1 was used as an antigen source. After elution of the serotype 1-specific polysaccharide epitope, the product was dialyzed and analyzed, using chemical and immunologic methods. The immunoaffinity product contained no detectable protein and greater than half the original hexosamine content. Using defined monoclonal antibodies in ELISA, titration of the original capsular material and the immunoaffinity product revealed specific retention of lipopolysaccharide, a 10- to 30-kd polysaccharide antigen common to all P haemolytica and P multocida serotypes, and serotype 1-specific capsular polysaccharide, indicating possible epitope sharing among polysaccharide antigens of P haemolytica serotype 1.
TI  - Treatment of calf pneumonia with tilmicosin.
AB  - The therapeutic effect of a single injection of tilmicosin (10 mg/kg body mass) against natural cases of pneumonia of calves, compared to other conventionally used antibiotics, was examined under field conditions. The trials were conducted in three cattle herds and included the treatment of 135 calves with 82 controls. The animals' age ranged from 1 week to 4 months. Prior to the treatment and in case of death bacteriological examinations from nasal swabs and from the lungs were carried out. Clinical signs were recorded in all groups and in one group body mass gains were also recorded. After tilmicosin treatment, the body temperature returned to the normal level within 24 h and the animals recovered within 1 to 2 days. Ten calves (7.41%) showed relapse during the 3rd and 4th week after treatment in contrast to 9 (10.98%) in the control group. Three calves (2.22%) died in the groups treated with tilmicosin and 6 calves (7.32%) among the controls. In one of the treated groups the body mass gain was 6.2% higher compared to the controls at the age of 3 months. These results suggest that treatment with a single dose of tilmicosin is effective in most cases of calf pneumonia caused by bacteria.
TI  - Ovine pulmonary surfactant induces killing of Pasteurella haemolytica, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae by normal serum.
AB  - Pulmonary surfactant has been shown to play an increasingly important role in bacterial clearance at the alveolar surface in the lung. This study describes a bactericidal mechanism in which ovine pulmonary surfactant induces killing of Pasteurella haemolytica by normal serum. To demonstrate killing, six bacterial species were incubated first with pulmonary surfactant for 60 min at 37 degrees C and then with serum for an additional 60 min at 37 degrees C. P. haemolytica type A1 strains 82-25 and L101, a P. haemolytica type 2 strain, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible and Pasteurella multocida, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not susceptible to killing by ovine pulmonary surfactant and normal serum. No bacteria incubated with bovine pulmonary surfactant were killed by normal serum. Although the species origin of pulmonary surfactant was selective, the species origin of serum was not. P. haemolytica incubated with ovine pulmonary surfactant was killed by fetal calf serum, gnotobiotic calf serum, pooled normal sheep serum, pooled normal rabbit serum, and pooled guinea pig serum. Ultrastructurally, killed P. haemolytica suspensions contained dead cells and cells distorted with vacuoles between the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm. The mechanism of killing did not correlate with concentrations of complement or lysozyme or titers of residual antibody in either the pulmonary surfactant or the serum, and killing was reduced by preincubation of surfactant with P. haemolytica lipopolysaccharide. Preliminary characterization of both surfactant and serum implicate a low-molecular-weight proteinaceous component in the surfactant and serum albumin in the serum. This mechanism may help clear certain gram-negative bacteria from the lungs of sheep as a part of the pulmonary innate defense system.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic evaluation of ceftiofur in serum, tissue chamber fluid and bronchial secretions from healthy beef-bred calves.
AB  - Ceftiofur is a new broad spectrum cephalosporin marketed for the treatment of acute bovine respiratory disease. In this investigation ceftiofur was administered by intramuscular injection, at 24 h intervals, to healthy beef-bred calves for four days at dosages of 2.2 and 4.4 mg/kg of body weight, with 4 wk intervals between dosing regimens. Serum, tissue chamber fluid (TCF), and bronchial secretion (BS) concentrations of ceftiofur were measured by microbiological assay after the first and fourth dose of each dosing regimen. Peak serum concentrations (Cmax) of 8.8 micrograms/mL and 17.3 micrograms/mL were obtained approximately 2 h (Tmax), the time of mean peak concentration) after single injections of 2.2 mg/kg and 4.4 mg/kg, respectively. The Cmax was increased approximately twofold following multiple doses of 2.2 mg/kg (Cmax = 13.1 micrograms/mL) and 4.4 mg/kg (Cmax = 24.1 micrograms/mL). Ceftiofur accumulated slowly into TCF and peak concentrations were found to be approximately 14% of those observed in serum after the first dose and approximately 24% after multiple dosing. Concentrations of ceftiofur in BS were obtained rapidly with peak concentrations reaching 45% of the serum Cmax after the first dose. After multiple dosing the Cmax for BS was approximately 25% of the serum Cmax. This study found that both the 2.2 mg/kg and 4.4 mg/kg dosing regimens resulted in continuous serum, TCF and BS concentrations of ceftiofur that exceeded the minimal concentration required to inhibit the bacteria most frequently isolated from calves with acute bovine respiratory disease.
TI  - Serological titers to bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhea virus, parainfluenza 3 virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and Pasteurella haemolytica in feedlot calves with respiratory disease: associations with bacteriological and pulmonary cytological variables.
AB  - Acute and convalescent serum samples were taken from 59 calves with signs of respiratory disease (cases) and 60 clinically normal animals (controls) during their first month in the feedlot. Sera were analyzed for antibodies to bovine parainfluenza 3 (PI3) virus by hemagglutination inhibition, to bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus, bovine respiratory syncytial (BRS) virus and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) by virus neutralization, and to Pasteurella haemolytica by indirect agglutination (PhIA) and cytotoxin neutralization (PhCN) tests. There was minimal evidence of serological activity to BHV1. Serological activity to the other agents occurred commonly and the prevalence of acute titers and their mean values was similar in case and control groups. Mean convalescent PI3 and P. haemolytica (PhIA) titers were higher in controls than cases (p < 0.01) but, otherwise, convalescent titers did not differ between groups. The incidence of seroconversion was similar in both groups for all agents except for PI3 virus which was more frequent in controls than cases (p < 0.0001). There was a positive association between PhIA and CN seroconversion and isolation of P. haemolytica from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (p < 0.1). The measure of agreement (kappa) between seroconversion with the P. haemolytica PhIA and PhCN tests was 0.51. Bacteriological and cytological evaluations of the respiratory tract were made using BAL. No associations were evident between serological titers and pulmonary cytology. A multivariate logistic analysis was used to evaluate associations between disease status and serological, bacteriological and cytological data. Cases were positively associated with the presence of neutrophils and Pasteurella multocida in BAL fluid and negatively associated with PI3 virus and PhIA seroconversion.
TI  - A characterization of monoclonal antibodies prepared against Pasteurella haemolytica serotype 1 surface antigens.
AB  - The production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against Pasteurella  haemolytica serotype 1 is described. Ten monoclonal antibodies were produced and divided, on the basis of their properties, into six different groups. One produced bacteria agglutination only of P. haemolytica serotype 1. Three antibodies bound with P. haemolytica serotypes 1, 5-8 and 12 and the antigen was identified in immunoblots as lipopolysaccharide. Two antibodies bound P. haemolytica serotypes 1, 2, 5-8 and 12 and P. multocida serotypes 1-7, 9, 12, 15 and 16, recognizing an epitope present on a 29 kDa outer membrane protein. One antibody bound all P. haemolytica and P. multocida serotypes. The antigen was a hexosamine less than 30 kDa which contained a formalin sensitive epitope. One antibody bound only to P. haemolytica serotype 1 and the antigen was identified as a 66 kDa outer membrane protein. Two antibodies bound P. haemolytica serotypes 1, 2, 5-9 and 12 and the antigen, while not identified, was localized on the outer membrane. This study identified antigens which contribute to the cross-reactions among P. haemolytica and P. multocida serotypes and the antibodies may be useful in investigating the pathogenesis of pneumonic pasteurellosis.
TI  - [Results of experimental immunization of calves with different Pasteurella antigens].
AB  - Calves immunised with different Pasteurella antigens (inactivated whole cells, sodium chloride extract) where challenged two weeks after the second immunization with the homologous strain. The intracutaneous application of whole cells of P. haemolytica A1 and P. multocida A was effective. The incidence of pneumonia was reduced and the pneumonic lesions were less severe. The sodium chloride extract was not effective.
TI  - Characterization and comparison of antimicrobial susceptibilities and outer membrane protein and plasmid DNA profiles of Pasteurella haemolytica and certain other members of the genus Pasteurella.
AB  - The outer membrane protein (OMP), plasmid, and antimicrobial resistance profiles  of Pasteurella haemolytica serotypes 1 through 12, a bovine isolate of P multocida, a chicken isolate of P multocida, and an unidentified Pasteurella species of bovine origin were examined. Isolates of P haemolytica serotypes belonging to the same biotype possessed similar OMP profiles. Biotype A isolates contained 2 prominent OMP of 43 kilodaltons (kD) and 29 kD, whereas biotype-T serotypes contained 3 major OMP of 43, 36, and 25 kD. The major OMP profiles of the 2 P multocida isolates and the unidentified Pasteurella species were different from each other and from P haemolytica isolates. Plasmid DNA screening indicated both plasmid-containing and plasmid-free P haemolytica and P multocida isolates. Multiple drug resistance was found in pasteurellae isolates with and without plasmids. However, a relationship between drug resistance and plasmid isolation was found in 3 of 4 haemolytica serotype 1 field isolates, all of which contained a 2.51-megadalton plasmid and had multiple drug resistance for benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, and tetracycline.
TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of parenterally administered danofloxacin in cattle.
AB  - Danofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial, developed specifically for veterinary use. Its in vitro activity and pharmacokinetic properties have been investigated to assess its potential for use in the therapy of respiratory disease in cattle. The minimum inhibitory concentration of danofloxacin against 90% (MIC90) of contemporary European and North American field isolates of Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Haemophilus somnus, the most important bacterial respiratory pathogens of cattle, was 0.125 micrograms/ml. The plasma and lung kinetics of danofloxacin following parenteral administration of 1.25 mg/kg were evaluated in two studies. Danofloxacin was rapidly absorbed following intramuscular and subcutaneous injection and bioavailability was virtually complete (101% and 94% respectively). Plasma concentration profiles of danofloxacin were similar for intramuscular and subcutaneous routes with no significant differences in the area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) following one, three or five consecutive daily doses, although slightly higher peak plasma concentrations were achieved by the intramuscular route. Following intramuscular administration, the mean peak lung concentration of danofloxacin was 4.1 times greater than that of plasma. Similarly, the AUC for lung tissue was 3.7 times greater than that for plasma. These data indicate that danofloxacin should be particularly appropriate for the therapy of bacterial respiratory disease in cattle.
TI  - The microbial flora of the respiratory tract in feedlot calves: associations between nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures.
AB  - The upper and lower respiratory tracts of 59 feedlot calves with clinical signs of naturally occurring respiratory disease (cases) and 60 comparison (control) animals were cultured before treatment, using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The most prevalent organisms were Pasteurella multocida and Mycoplasma bovis. Isolations of P. multocida from NPS and BAL fluid were found to be significantly associated with morbidity (p less than or equal to 0.05), but the frequency with which other organisms were isolated from the nasopharynx and lungs was similar in cases and controls. There was evidence of moderate agreement between NPS and BAL isolates at the individual calf level using the kappa statistic, (range of kappa values = 0.47-0.61) but the variability of the kappa statistics was large. Therefore, in an individual calf NPS cultures did not accurately predict BAL cultures. The NPS and BAL culture results were quite similar at the group level, however.
TI  - Genomic distribution of a serotype 1-specific antigen-coding DNA fragment of Pasteurella haemolytica.
AB  - A genomic fragment of Pasteurella haemolytica biotype A coding for a serotype 1-specific agglutinating antigen was used as a probe in a series of hybridization experiments to determine distribution of the fragment in various P. haemolytica serotypes as well as other bacteria. Results showed presence of the fragment in seven out of the 12 serotypes tested, all of which belonged to biotype A. Two other serotypes belonging to biotype A, all three serotypes belonging to biotype T, two Pasteurella multocida isolates and Escherichia coli did not have the fragment in their genome. Thus the expression of the P. haemolytica biotype A serotype 1-specific agglutinating antigen (PHA1SAA) seems to be due to serotype-specific regulation of protein expression rather than to genetic deletion. Differences in methylation of the PHA1SAA-coding fragment was also noted in DpnI and Sau3AI genomic DNA digests from the various serotypes analyzed by Southern blot. However, no apparent correlation was observed between methylation and PHA1SAA expression. E. coli with a recombinant plasmid containing a homologous genomic fragment derived from P. haemolytica serotype 2 also expressed PHA1SAA.
TI  - Evaluation of combined Pasteurella vaccines in control of sheep pneumonia.
AB  - The effectiveness of an oil adjuvant vaccine (OAV) incorporating locally isolated strains of Pasteurella haemolytica type 7 and Pasteurella multocida types A and D was compared with that of Carovax (Wellcome Laboratories) in imported cross-bred lambs. The criterion of efficacy was the ability of the vaccines to reduce the extent of pneumonic lesions in vaccinated as against unvaccinated control lambs. The OAV produced at this Institute significantly reduced the lung lesions at P less than 0.05 level compared with its control group when challenged with P. haemolytica alone. However, the vaccine was unsatisfactory against P. multocida or combined P. multocida P. haemolytica challenge. Carovax did not produce any significant reduction in the lung lesions caused by P. haemolytica and/or P. multocida.
TI  - Characterization of Pasteurella hemolytica isolated from the respiratory tract of cattle.
AB  - Morphological, cultural, biochemical, and serological characteristics of 43 strains of Pasteurella hemolytica isolated from the respiratory tract of cattle, including 37 that had shipping fever, were determined. With one exception, all strains satisfied the major criteria for differentiation of the species from P. multocida - hemolysis on blood agar, absence of indole production, and growth on MacConkey's agar. Many strain variations in fermentative capacity were noted, although other biochemical characteristics were relatively constant. The ability of a strain to ferment carbohydrates often depended upon the medium in which the test was conducted. All strains studied were identified as type A strains on the basis of colonial morphology, biochemical, and growth characteristics, and sensitivity to penicillin. When grouped on the basis of serological reactions, 38 strains were type 1, three were type 2, one was type 11, and one was untypable; 34 of the shipping fever strains were 1 and three were type 2.
