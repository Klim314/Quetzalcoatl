TI  - Assessment of microbial diversity in human colonic samples by 16S rDNA sequence analysis.
AB  - Abstract The bacterial species diversity of three colonic tissue samples from elderly people was investigated by sequence analysis of randomly cloned eubacterial 16S rDNA. The majority of sequences (87%) clustered within three bacterial groups: (1) Bacteroides; (2) low G+C content Gram-positives related to Clostridium coccoides (cluster XIVa); (3) Gram-positives related to Clostridium leptum (cluster IV). These groups have been shown to dominate the human faecal flora. Only 25% of sequences were closely related (>97%) to current species type strains, and 28% were less than 97% related to any database entry. 19% of sequences were most closely related to recently isolated butyrate-producing bacteria belonging to clusters XIVa and IV, with a further 18% of the sequences most closely related to Ruminococcus obeum and Ruminococcus torques (members of cluster XIVa). These results provide the first molecular information on the microbial diversity present in human colonic samples.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparison reveals two unrelated groups of species within the genus Ruminococcus.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of the genus Ruminococcus based on 16S rDNA sequence data showed the genus to be phylogenetically heterogenous. Ruminococcus species fall within the radiation of the Bacillus/Clostridium subphylum of the Gram-positive line of descent. Two distinct and unrelated clusters are recovered. One group contains R. flavefaciens, R. albus, R. bromii, and R. callidus. The second group constitutes R. gnavus, R. hansenii, R. lactaris, R. obeum, R. productus and R. torques which together with some Clostridium species may constitute a new genus.
