TI  - Using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  - High throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. However, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. In this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. We then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity and biogeography patterns. Mock community analysis showed primer and DNA isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequencing of salivary and mucosal communities found a total of 455 OTUs (0.3% dissimilarity) with only 78 of these present in all subjects. We demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. With respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. These differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by the abundance of Streptococcus mitis and Gemella haemolysans in mucosa. In summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. Despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological studies of children and adolescents receiving orthodontic treatment.
AB  - PURPOSE: This case-controlled study examined clinical and microbiological parameters in Brazilian children and adolescents receiving orthodontic treatment using fixed orthodontic appliances or removable orthodontic appliances. METHODS: The plaque index, gingival index, number of decayed, missing and filled teeth, and probing pocket depth was measured on each fully erupted tooth in 30 patients treated with fixed orthodontic appliances and an equal number of age and sex-matched control subjects. The same parameters were also measured in 18 patients treated with removable orthodontic appliances and an equal number of age and sex-matched control subjects. In the patients treated with fixed orthodontic appliances, subgingival plaque samples were collected from four teeth with orthodontic brackets and from four teeth with orthodontic bands. In the patients with removable appliances, subgingival plaque samples were collected from clasped maxillary permanent first molar teeth and from four unclasped permanent teeth. Samples of unstimulated whole saliva and samples from the dorsal surface of the tongue were also obtained from each subject. Each sample was analyzed for the presence of 19 target bacteria by dot blot. A subset of samples was examined by direct amplification of bacterial nucleic acids. RESULTS: Compared to their respective age and sex-matched controls, whole mouth means for plaque index and gingival index were significantly elevated in both the fixed and removable orthodontic groups. There was no difference in the DMFT. Subjects with fixed orthodontic appliances had a higher prevalence of each of the target species except for L. fermentum, Neisseriaceae and S. mutans. The prevalence of A. naeslundii and Streptococcus sp. was significantly higher on teeth with orthodontic brackets alone compared to teeth with both orthodontic bands and brackets. Subjects with removable orthodontic appliances had a higher prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, E. corrodens, L. fermentum, Neisseriaceae, and spirochetes. The prevalence of Neisseriaceae was significantly higher on unclasped teeth compared to clasped teeth. There was no difference between sample sites for the target bacteria except for A. actinomycetemcomitans that was detected less frequently in saliva. Orthodontic patients demonstrated higher proportions of gram negative species by direct amplification of nucleic acids including species frequently associated with periodontal disease as well as rarely cultivable or non-cultivable species such as Abiotrophia defectiva, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, Lautropia sp., Terrahaemophilus aromaticivorans, and TM7 bacterium.
