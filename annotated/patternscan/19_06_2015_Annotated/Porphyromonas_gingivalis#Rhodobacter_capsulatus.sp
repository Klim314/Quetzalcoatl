TI  == effects of substrate analogues and ph on manganese superoxide dismutases.
AB  == the effect of the substrate analogues azide and fluoride on the manganese(ii) zero-field interactions of different manganese-containing superoxide dismutases (sod) was measured using high-field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. two cambialistic types, proteins that are active with manganese or iron, were studied along with two that were only active with iron and another that was only  active with manganese. it was found that azide was able to coordinate directly to the pentacoordinated mn(ii) site of only the mnsod from escherichia coli and the  cambialistic sod from rhodobacter capsulatus. the formation of a hexacoordinate azide-bound center was characterized by a large reduction in the mn(ii) zero-field interaction. in contrast, all five sods were affected by fluoride, but no evidence for hexacoordinate mn(ii) formation was detected. for both azide and  fluoride, the extent of binding was no more than 50%, implying either that a second binding site was present or that binding was self-limiting. only the mn(ii) zero-field interactions of the two sods that had little or no activity with manganese were found to be significantly affected by ph, the manganese-substituted iron superoxide dismutase from e. coli and the gly155thr mutant of the cambialistic sod from porphyromonas gingivalis. a model for anion binding and the observed pk involving tyrosine-34 is presented.

TI  == manganese(ii) zero-field interaction in cambialistic and manganese superoxide dismutases and its relationship to the structure of the metal binding site.
AB  == the mn(ii) high-magnetic-field electron paramagnetic resonance (hfepr) spectra of five different superoxide dismutases (sods) were measured at 190 and 285 ghz. the native e. coli manganese sod was found to be distinct from the other sods by virtue of its large zero-field e-value. the two wild-type cambialistic proteins from porphyromonas gingivalis and rhodobacter capsulatus were also distinct. however, the gly155thr mutant of the p. gingivalis sod changed the mn(ii) spectrum so that it closely resembled the spectrum of manganese reconstituted e.  coli iron sod. this observation paralleled enzyme activity measurements that show that this mutation causes the loss of activity with manganese and enhanced activity with iron indicating a conversion from a cambialistic to an iron-specific protein. the mn(ii) magnetic parameters were determined by simultaneously fitting the multifrequency data. simulations were carried out by numerically diagonalizing the spin hamiltonian and explicitly calculating all possible transition probabilities. the relationship between the mn(ii) zero-field interaction and structure of the metal binding site is also discussed.
