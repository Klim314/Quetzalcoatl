TI  == bacterial species specificity in prou osmoinducibility and nptii and lacz expression.
AB  == reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. to more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. a comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptii promoter (p(nptii)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacz promoter (p(lacz)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than p(lacz). for the species that expressed p(lacz), however,p(lacz) was expressed 3-fold more than p(nptii), on average. the escherichia coli prou promoter, which is induced by low water potential in e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae, was  shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of clavibacter michiganensis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of staphylococcus aureus and erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in prou inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.

TI  == anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activity of some herbal remedies from tanzania.
AB  == plants are not only important to the millions of people to whom traditional medicine serves as the only opportunity for health care and to those who use plants for various purposes in their daily lives, but also as a source of new pharmaceuticals. during interviews with the pare people from northeastern tanzania, 29 plants that are used for medicinal purposes as well as 41 plants used for non-medicinal purposes were reported. six medicinally used plants were selected for bioactivity analysis. extracts of coccinia adoensis, cineraria grandiflora, pavonia urens, marattia fraxinea, clutia abyssinica var. usambarica, and vangueria infausta were made using ethyl acetate, methanol, cold water and boiling water. the antimicrobial activity was tested on candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus, fusarium culmorum, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas syringae, and erwinia amylovora. all plants showed activity against several test  organisms.
