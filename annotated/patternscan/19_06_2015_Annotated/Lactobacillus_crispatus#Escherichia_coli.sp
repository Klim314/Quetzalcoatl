TI  == the significance of lactobacillus crispatus and l. vaginalis for vaginal health and the negative effect of recent sex: a cross-sectional descriptive study across groups of african women.
AB  == background: women in sub-saharan africa are vulnerable to acquiring hiv infection and reproductive tract infections. bacterial vaginosis (bv), a disruption of the  vaginal microbiota, has been shown to be strongly associated with hiv infection.  risk factors related to potentially protective or harmful microbiota species are  not known. methods: we present cross-sectional quantitative polymerase chain reaction data of the lactobacillus genus, five lactobacillus species, and three bv-related bacteria (gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and prevotella bivia) together with escherichia coli and candida albicans in 426 african women across different groups at risk for hiv. we selected a reference group of adult hiv-negative women at average risk for hiv acquisition and compared species variations in subgroups of adolescents, hiv-negative pregnant women, women engaging in traditional vaginal practices, sex workers and a group of hiv-positive women on combination antiretroviral therapy. we explored the associations between presence and quantity of the bacteria with bv by nugent score, in relation to several factors of known or theoretical importance. results: the presence of species across kenyan, south african and rwandan women was remarkably similar and few differences were seen between the two groups of reference women in kenya and south africa. the rwandan sex workers and hiv-positive women had the highest g. vaginalis presence (p = 0.006). pregnant women had a higher lactobacillus genus mean log (7.01 genome equivalents (geq)/ml) compared to the reference women (6.08 geq/ml). l. vaginalis (43%) was second to l. iners (81.9%) highly present in women with a normal nugent score. recent sexual exposure negatively affected the presence of l. crispatus (<0.001), l. vaginalis (p = 0.001), and lactobacillus genus (p < 0.001). having more than one sexual partner in the last three months was associated with an increased prevalence of g. vaginalis (p = 0.044) and l. iners (p = 0.001). conclusions: although the composition of species across the studied african countries was similar, the presence of protective species i.e. l. crispatus and l. vaginalis in women with a normal nugent score appeared lower compared to non-african studies.  furthermore, lactobacillus species were negatively affected by sexual behavioural. strategies to support protective lactobacillus species are urgently  needed. trial registration: the study is registered at the trial registration at  the national health research ethics council south africa with the number doh2709103223.

TI  == determining the probiotic potential of cholesterol-reducing lactobacillus and weissella strains isolated from gherkins (fermented cucumber) and south indian fermented koozh.
AB  == this study sought to evaluate the probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditionally fermented south indian koozh and gherkin (cucumber). a total of 51 lab strains were isolated, among which four were identified as lactobacillus spp. and three as weissella spp. the strains were screened for their probiotic potential. all isolated lactobacillus and weissella  strains were capable of surviving under low ph and bile salt conditions. gi9 and  fki21 were able to survive at ph 2.0 and 0.50% bile salt for 3 h without losing their viability. all lab strains exhibited inhibitory activity against tested pathogens and were able to deconjugate bile salt. higher deconjugation was observed in the presence of sodium glycocholate (p < 0.05). strain fki21 showed maximum auto-aggregation (79%) and co-aggregation with escherichia coli mtcc 1089 (68%). exopolysaccharide production of lab strains ranged from 68.39 to 127.12 mg/l (p < 0.05). moreover, gi9 (58.08 mug/ml) and fki21 (56.25 mug/ml) exhibited  maximum cholesterol reduction with bile salts. 16s rrna sequencing confirmed gi9  and fki21 as lactobacillus crispatus and weissella koreensis, respectively. this  is the first study to report isolation of w. koreensis fki21 from fermented koozh and demonstrates its cholesterol-reducing potential.

TI  == heterologous expression of carcinoembryonic antigen in lactococcus lactis via lcsb-mediated surface displaying system for oral vaccine development.
AB  == background/purpose: carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) is an attractive target for immunotherapy because it is expressed minimally in normal tissue, but is overexpressed in a wide variety of malignant epithelial tissues. lactic acid bacteria (labs), widely used in food processes, are attractive candidates for oral vaccination. thus, we examined whether labs could be used as a live vaccine  vector to deliver cea antigen. methods: cea was cloned into an escherichia coli/lactococcus lactis shuttle vector psec:leiss under the control of a nisin promoter. for displaying the cea on the cell surface of the l. lactis strain, the anchor motif lcsb from the s-layer protein of lactobacillus crispatus was fused with cea. intracellular and cell surface expression of the cea-lcsb fusion was confirmed by western blot analysis. results: significantly higher levels of cea-specific secretory immunoglobulin a in the sera of mice were observed upon oral administration of strain cultures containing the cea-lcsb fused protein. in  addition, the cea-lcsb antigen group showed a higher spleen index compared to the cea antigen alone or negative control, demonstrating that surface-displayed cea antigen could induce a higher immune response. conclusion: these results provided the first evidence for displaying cea antigen on the cell surfaces of labs as oral vaccines against cancer or infectious diseases.

TI  == bacteriocin production and gene sequencing analysis from vaginal lactobacillus strains.
AB  == the human vagina is a complex and dynamic ecosystem containing an abundance of microorganisms. in women of childbearing age, this system is dominated by lactobacillus spp. in the present work, seventeen newly isolated vaginal strains  were identified by 16s rdna sequencing and were investigated for their antimicrobial properties. twelve of the isolated lactobacillus strains showed activity against one or more microorganisms. six and five of them produced substances that inhibited the growth of two different klebsiella strains and staphylococcus aureus, respectively. two lactobacilli strains were active against an escherichia coli strain, one isolate was active against an enterococus faecalis strain and another lactobacilli strain showed antimicrobial activity against a candida parapsilosis strain. the nature of the active compounds was additionally studied, and the presence of bacteriocin-like substances was proved. the genes related to the bacteriocin production in three of the newly isolated strains were identified and sequenced. the presence of gassericin a operon in the genome of the species lactobacillus crispatus was described for the first time. the presence of antimicrobial activity contributes to their possible use as potential probiotic strains after further research.

TI  == lactobacillus crispatus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with inhibitory activity of female genital tract secretions against escherichia coli.
AB  == objective: female genital tract secretions inhibit e. coli ex vivo and the activity may prevent colonization and provide a biomarker of a healthy microbiome. we hypothesized that high e. coli inhibitory activity would be associated with a lactobacillus crispatus and/or jensenii dominant microbiome and differ from that of women with low inhibitory activity. study design: vaginal swab cell pellets from 20 samples previously obtained in a cross-sectional study  of near-term pregnant and non-pregnant healthy women were selected based on having high (>90% inhibition) or low (<20% inhibition) anti-e. coli activity. the v6 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene was amplified and sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2000 platform. filtered culture supernatants from lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and gardnerella vaginalis were also assayed for e. coli inhibitory activity. results: sixteen samples (10 with high and 6 with low activity) yielded evaluable microbiome data. there was no difference in the predominant microbiome species in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 8  each). however, there were significant differences between women with high compared to low e. coli inhibitory activity. high activity was associated with a  predominance of l. crispatus (p<0.007) and culture supernatants from l. crispatus exhibited greater e. coli inhibitory activity compared to supernatants obtained from l. iners or g. vaginalis. notably, the e. coli inhibitory activity varied among different strains of l. crispatus. conclusion: microbiome communities with  abundant l. crispatus likely contribute to the e. coli inhibitory activity of vaginal secretions and efforts to promote this environment may prevent e. coli colonization and related sequelae including preterm birth.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == the microbiota of the human genitourinary tract: trying to see the forest through the trees.
AB  == based on traditional microbiological methods, namely cultivation and microscopic  analyses, the vaginal microbiota (vmb) has been defined as healthy when it is predominated by hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus spp., most prominently  lactobacillis crispatus. similarly, the vmb has been defined as bacterial vaginosis (bv) when it is predominated by gardnerella vaginalis as well as a number of other anaerobic bacterial species. bv is associated with a distinct vaginal discharge syndrome, poor pregnancy outcomes, pelvic inflammatory disease, post-operative wound infections, and endometritis after elective abortions. additionally, bv predisposes women to infection by hiv as well as other sexually  transmitted diseases (stds). the application of molecular techniques over the last decade to studies of the vmb has significantly advanced our understanding of its structure and variation. it is now clear that the diversity of the vmb is far more complex than previously recognized; it is comprised of many heretofore unknown bacteria in addition to those previously identified by culture. here we describe the application of 454 pyrosequencing technology to a study of vaginal specimens from 92 women attending the new orleans std clinic in an effort to obtain a more precise view of how different types of "trees" (bacteria) assemble  to form a recognizable "forest" (vmb). this knowledge will be useful in the design of future clinical studies that investigate the mechanisms by which the vaginal microbiome influences human health and disease.

TI  == lactobacillus proteins are associated with the bactericidal activity against e. coli of female genital tract secretions.
AB  == background: female genital tract secretions are bactericidal for escherichia (e.) coli ex vivo. however, the intersubject variability and molecules that contribute to this activity have not been defined. methods: the bactericidal activity and concentration of immune mediators in cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) collected from 99 healthy women were determined. results: cvl reduced the number of e. coli colonies by 68% [-26, 100] (median [range]). cvl were active against laboratory and clinical isolates of e. coli, but were inactive against lactobacillus species. bactericidal activity correlated with the concentration of protein recovered (p<0.001), but not with cytokines, chemokines or antimicrobial peptides. four cvl with>90% inhibitory activity (active) and two with<30% activity were subjected to ms/ms proteomic analysis. 215 proteins were identified and six were found exclusively in active samples. four of these corresponded to lactobacillus crispatus or jensenii proteins. moreover, culture supernatants from lactobacillus jensenii were bactericidal for e. coli. conclusion: both host and commensal microbiota proteins contribute to mucosal defense. identification of these proteins will facilitate the development of strategies to maintain a healthy vaginal microbiome and prevent colonization with pathogenic bacteria such as e. coli that increase the risk for urinary tract infections, preterm labor and perinatal infection.

TI  == altered biomarkers of mucosal immunity and reduced vaginal lactobacillus concentrations in sexually active female adolescents.
AB  == background: genital secretions collected from adult women exhibit in vitro activity against herpes simplex virus (hsv) and escherichia coli (e. coli), but prior studies have not investigated this endogenous antimicrobial activity or its mediators in adolescent females. methodology/principal findings: anti-hsv and anti-e.coli activity were quantified from cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) specimens collected from 20 sexually active adolescent females (15-18 years). soluble immune mediators that may influence this activity were measured in cvl, and concentrations of lactobacillus jensenii and crispatus were quantified by pcr from vaginal swabs. results for adolescents were compared to those obtained from  54 healthy, premenopausal adult women. relative to specimens collected from adults, cvl collected from adolescent subjects had significantly reduced activity against e. coli and diminished concentrations of protein, igg, and iga but significantly increased anti-hsv activity and concentrations of interleukin (il)-1alpha, il-6 and il-1 receptor antagonist. vaginal swabs collected from adolescent subjects had comparable concentrations of l. crispatus but significantly reduced concentrations of l. jensenii, relative to adult swabs. conclusions/significance: biomarkers of genital mucosal innate immunity may differ substantially between sexually active adolescents and adult women. these findings warrant further study and may have significant implications for prevention of sexually transmitted infections in adolescent females.

TI  == bile stimulates cell surface hydrophobicity, congo red binding and biofilm formation of lactobacillus strains.
AB  == seventeen lactobacillus strains were tested for cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) using the salt aggregation test (sat) and congo red binding (crb) assay. crb was  dependent on ph and ionic strength and was protease-sensitive. in the presence of 100 mug ml(-1) cholesterol, the crb was significantly reduced. autoaggregating (aa) lactobacillus crispatus strains showed 50% more crb than the reference strain, the curli-producing escherichia coli mc4 100. crb of l. crispatus 12005,  l. paracasei f8, l. plantarum f44 and l. paracasei f19 were enhanced when grown in man rogosa sharpe (mrs) broth with 0.5% taurocholic acid (ta) or 5% porcine bile (pb) (p < 0.05). csh was also enhanced for the non-aa strains l. plantarum f44, l. paracasei f19 and l. rhamnosus gg when grown in mrs broth with 0.5% ta, 5% pb or 0.25% mucin, with enhanced biofilm formation in mrs broth with bile (p < 0.05). two aa strains, l. crispatus 12005 and l. paracasei f8, developed biofilm  independent of bile or mucin. in summary, under bile-stressed growth conditions,  early (24-h cultures) biofilm formation is associated with an increase in hydrophobic cell surface proteins and high crb. late mature (72-h culture) biofilm contained more carbohydrates, as shown by crystal violet staining.

TI  == characterization of a s-layer protein from lactobacillus crispatus k313 and the domains responsible for binding to cell wall and adherence to collagen.
AB  == it was previously shown that the surface (s)-layer proteins covering the cell surface of lactobacillus crispatus k313 were involved in the adherence of this strain to human intestinal cell line ht-29. to further elucidate the structures and functions of s-layers, three putative s-layer protein genes (slpa, slpb, and  slpc) of l. crispatus k313 were amplified by pcr, sequenced, and characterized in detail. quantitative real-time pcr analysis reveals that slpa was silent under the tested conditions; whereas slpb and slpc, the putative amino acid sequences which exhibited minor similarities to the previously reported s-layer proteins in l. crispatus, were actively expressed. slpb, which was predominantly expressed in l. crispatus k313, was further investigated for its functional domains. genetic truncation of the untranslated leader sequence (utls) of slpb results in a reduction in protein production, indicating that the utls contributed to the efficient s-layer protein expression. by producing a set of n- and c-terminally truncated recombinant slpb proteins in escherichia coli, the cell wall-binding region was mapped to the c terminus, where rslpb(380-501) was sufficient for binding to isolated cell wall fragments. moreover, the binding ability of the c terminus was variable among the lactobacillus species (s-layer- and non-s-layer-producing strains), and teichoic acid may be acting as the receptor of slpb. to determine the adhesion region of slpb to extracellular matrix proteins, elisa was performed. binding to immobilized types i and iv collagen was observed with the his-slpb(1-379) peptides, suggesting that the extracellular matrix protein-binding domain was located in the n terminus.

TI  == [analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy chinese women by using dna-fingerprinting].
AB  == objective: to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to chinese females. methods: women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in peking university first hospital from october 2009 to january 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the v3 region of 16s  rdna gene. pcr products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). featured bands on dgge were recovered, cloned and sequenced. alignment with known sequence was made by using blast on genbank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora  in different physiological states. results: (1) vaginal flora in healthy chinese  women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. common bacteria included: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. while l. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) vaginal  bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. common bacteria included: lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gallolyticus, veillonella sp., streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus, prevotella sp., anaerococcus lactolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. conclusion: based on the dgge analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in chinese healthy women at reproductive age are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., prevotella sp.,bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing veillonella sp. and anaerococcus lactolyticus. meanwhile lactobacillus iners was firstly found by dgge to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.

TI  == spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef with added lactic  acid bacteria displayed at abusive temperatures.
AB  == growth of pathogenic organisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. can be inhibited in ground beef through the addition of certain lactic acid-producing bacteria (lab; lactobacillus acidophilus np51, lactobacillus crispatus np35, pediococcus acidilactici, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis). this study evaluated the effects of lab inclusion on the organoleptic and biochemical properties typically associated with spoilage in traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive (10 degrees c) temperatures for 36 h. trained and untrained panelist evaluations of lean color and off-odor, as well as instrumental color analyses, did not indicate an effect on spoilage traits due to lab utilization (p > 0.05). however, display length affected each variable independently and was indicative of decreased stability and acceptability as display time (h) increased (p < 0.05). thiobarbituric acid values were decreased  for ground beef with added lab (p < 0.05), but likely can be related to bacterial degradation of lipid oxidation by-products because no reduction in organoleptic traits due to oxidation was noted between treatments. overall, lab did not adversely influence the spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive temperatures for up to 36 h. furthermore, biochemical and sensory indicators of spoilage were present for all treatments at the conclusion of display. therefore, lab can be added to ground beef in traditional  packaging as a processing intervention without masking or delaying the expected spoilage characteristics.

TI  == heterologous protein display on the cell surface of lactic acid bacteria mediated by the s-layer protein.
AB  == background: previous studies have revealed that the c-terminal region of the s-layer protein from lactobacillus is responsible for the cell wall anchoring, which provide an approach for targeting heterologous proteins to the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, we developed a new surface display system in lactic acid bacteria with the c-terminal region of s-layer protein slpb of lactobacillus crispatus k2-4-3 isolated from chicken intestine. results: multiple sequence alignment revealed that the c-terminal region (lcsb) of lb. crispatus k2-4-3 slpb had a high similarity with the cell wall binding domains sa and cbsa of lactobacillus acidophilus and lb. crispatus. to evaluate the potential application as an anchoring protein, the green fluorescent protein (gfp) or beta-galactosidase (gal) was fused to the n-terminus of the lcsb region, and the fused proteins were successfully produced in escherichia coli, respectively. after mixing them with the non-genetically modified lactic acid bacteria cells, the fused gfp-lcsb and gal-lcsb were functionally associated with the cell surface of various lactic acid bacteria tested. in addition, the binding capacity could be improved by sds pretreatment. moreover, both of the fused proteins could simultaneously bind to the surface of a single cell. furthermore,  when the fused dna fragment of gfp:lcsb was inserted into the lactococcus lactis  expression vector psec:leiss:nuc, the gfp could not be secreted into the medium under the control of the nisa promoter. western blot, in-gel fluorescence assay,  immunofluorescence microscopy and sds sensitivity analysis confirmed that the gfp was successfully expressed onto the cell surface of l. lactis with the aid of the lcsb anchor. conclusion: the lcsb region can be used as a functional scaffold to  target the heterologous proteins to the cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria in  vitro and in vivo, and has also the potential for biotechnological application.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria toward their selection as a source of chicken probiotic.
AB  == in this study, 332 lactic acid bacteria of broiler gut origin were investigated as putative probiotic candidates. sixty-two bacteria showed the highest aggregation while showing antibacterial effects against salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, and escherichia coli o78:k80. enzymatic activities of the selected bacteria were examined. no lipase activity was detected, but all of them showed almost similar proteolytic activities. however, they had different amylase and phytase activities. four of the 62 bacterial strains were selected as a result of aggregation and amylase tests. they were chosen for the following attributes: high cell surface hydrophobicity, co-aggregation, and resistance to bile salts and also acidic conditions. finally, lactobacillus crispatus was selected as a source of potential probiotic because of its predominant characteristics in comparison to the other isolated strains from the gastrointestinal tract of chickens. this study has provided a good arrangement of rapid methods for screening a high number of bacteria: a series of beneficial tests that are used together for the first time on chickens, and not any other animals.

TI  == antagonistic potential against pathogenic microorganisms and hydrogen peroxide production of indigenous lactobacilli isolated from vagina of chinese pregnant women.
AB  == objective: to investigate the indigenous lactobacilli from the vagina of pregnant women and to screen the isolates with antagonistic potential against pathogenic microorganisms. methods: the strains were isolated from pregnant women's vagina and identified using the api50ch system. the ability of the isolates to produce hydrogen peroxide was analyzed semi-quantitatively using the tmb-hrp-mrs agar. the antagonistic effects of the isolates on pathogenic microorganisms were determined with a double layer agar plate. results: one hundred and three lactobacilli strains were isolated from 60 samples of vaginal secretion from healthy pregnant women. among them, 78 strains could produce hydrogen peroxide, in which 68%, 80%, 80%, and 88% had antagonistic effects against candida albicans cmcc98001, staphylococcus aureus cmcc26003, escherichia coli cmcc44113, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cmcc10110, respectively. conclusion: the recovery of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli decreases with the increasing pregnant age and time. the most commonly isolated species from vagina of chinese pregnant  women are lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus crispatus. most of l. acidophilus and l. crispatus produce a high h2o2 level.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
AB  == twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, c. perfringens). two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as l. crispatus or l. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of s. aureus, b. cereus and e. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. diarrhea-causing e. coli o8k88h9 ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of l. reuteri 12/26. mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.

AB  == enolase occurs as a cytoplasmic and a surface-associated protein in bacteria. enolases of the bacterial pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus, as well as of the commensal lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus johnsonii, were purified as his(6)-fusion proteins from recombinant escherichia coli. the fusion proteins were compared for putative virulence-associated functions, i.e., binding of human plasminogen, enhancement of plasminogen activation by human plasminogen activators, as well as binding to immobilized laminin, fibronectin and collagens. the individual enolases showed varying efficiencies in these functions. in particular, highly and equally effective interactions with plasminogen and laminin were seen with lactobacillar and staphylococcal enolases.

TI  == extracellular proteins of lactobacillus crispatus enhance activation of human plasminogen.
AB  == the abundant proteolytic plasminogen (plg)/plasmin system is important in several physiological functions in mammals and also engaged by a number of pathogenic microbial species to increase tissue invasiveness or to obtain nutrients. this paper reports that a commensal bacterium, lactobacillus crispatus, interacts with the plg system. strain st1 of l. crispatus enhanced activation of human plg by the tissue-type plg activator (tpa), whereas enhancement of the urokinase-mediated plg activation was lower. st1 cells bound plg, plasmin and tpa only poorly, and the plg-binding and activation-enhancing capacities were associated with extracellular material released from the bacteria into buffer. the extracellular proteome of l. crispatus st1 contained enolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) as major components. the enolase and the gapdh genes of st1 were cloned, sequenced and expressed in recombinant escherichia coli as his(6)-fusion proteins, which bound plg and enhanced its activation by tpa. variable levels of secretion of enolase and gapdh proteins as  well as of the plg activation cofactor function were detected in strains representing major taxonomic groups of the genus lactobacillus. so far, interference with the plg system has been addressed with pathogenic microbes. the results reported here demonstrate a novel interaction between a member of the microbiota and a major proteolytic system in humans.

TI  == the s-layer proteins of lactobacillus crispatus strain zj001 is responsible for competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == lactobacillus crispatus zj001, isolated from pig intestines and identified by sequencing analysis based on partial 16s rrna gene, was examined in vitro for probiotic activity exerted by the surface layer proteins (s-layer). the characteristics of l. crispatus zj001 were compared to lactobacillus acidophilus  atcc 4356 from the same genus which also produces the s-layer proteins. the strain zj001 was resistant to acidic condition and bile salt. its antagonistic properties such as adhesion, inhibition of the pathogen growth and competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium were apparently advantageous over l. acidophilus atcc 4356. sds-page analysis of cell  surface proteins revealed the presence of s-layer proteins, approximately at 42 kda in l. crispatus zj001. removal of the s-layer proteins reduced autoaggregation and adhesion to hela cells. the functional role of the s-layer proteins in adhesion was also confirmed by the antibody-mediated inhibition assay using the polyclonal antibody against the s-layer protein. the s-layer proteins from l. crispatus zj001 inhibited adhesion of s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7  to hela cells. these results suggest that l. crispatus zj001 possesses probiotic  properties and the s-layer proteins are involved in the adhesion and competitive  exclusion of pathogens to hela cells.

TI  == adherence of lactobacillus crispatus to vaginal epithelial cells from women with  or without a history of recurrent urinary tract infection.
AB  == purpose: lactobacillus crispatus strain ctv-05 is a vaginal probiotic proposed for use in women with recurrent urinary tract infection to reduce vaginal colonization with escherichia coli and the risk of urinary tract infection. however, the ability of this probiotic strain to adhere to the target mucosa, vaginal epithelial cells, has not been assessed in women with recurrent urinary tract infection. we measured the adherence of l. crispatus strain ctv-05 to vaginal epithelial cells collected from more than 100 premenopausal women with (cases) and without (controls) a history of recurrent urinary tract infection. we also examined the effects of relevant host factors on bacterial adherence. materials and methods: bacterial adherence assays were performed by combining l.  crispatus ctv-05 with exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells collected from 51 case  women and 51 controls. results: l. crispatus ctv-05 adhered in high numbers to vaginal epithelial cells from women with recurrent urinary tract infection (mean  adherence of 50.5 lactobacilli per vaginal epithelial cell) and controls (mean adherence of 39.4 lactobacilli per vaginal epithelial cell). adherence was significantly higher using vaginal epithelial cells from women with a maternal history of urinary tract infection (p = 0.036) and a nonsecretor phenotype (p < 0.001), but was not significantly affected by recent spermicide use, oral contraceptive use, menstrual cycle phase or sexual activity. conclusions: l. crispatus strain ctv-05 is highly adherent to vaginal epithelial cells collected  from a large sample of premenopausal women with or without a history of recent recurrent urinary tract infection. these data strongly support further evaluation of this probiotic in clinical trials of women with recurrent urinary tract infection.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide production and resistance to nonoxinol-9 in lactobacillus spp.  isolated from the vagina of reproductive-age women.
AB  == lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. however, some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide-producers. women, who usually use intrauterine dispositive (iud) and spermicides such as nonoxinol-9 (n-9) as contraceptive methods, increase the risk of acquiring an urinary tract infection  and a bacterial vaginosis; some studies have demonstrated that these compounds alter the normal vaginal biota. it is known that they inhibit lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% and that they do not have an effect on the  growth of escherichia coli. it is probable that the presence of nonoxinol-9 affects the ecological balance of the vagina by inhibiting the protector lactobacilli. in this study, we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. brevis,  l. crispatus, l. fermentii and l. jensenii as the species most frequently isolated from women. seventy-one hydrogen peroxide-producer strains and 48 strains resistant to the inhibitory effect of nonoxinol-9 were detected. l. brevis showed the highest number of resistant strains.

TI  == selection and identification of anaerobic lactobacilli producing inhibitory compounds against vaginal pathogens.
AB  == two strains of lactobacillus crispatus (15l08 and 21l07) and one strain of lactobacillus jensenii (5l08) were selected from amongst 100 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization and the production of h2o2 and/or bacteriocin-like compound. all three strains self-aggregated and adhered to vaginal epithelial cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as gardnerella vaginalis and candida albicans. lactobacillus crispatus 15l08 was characterized as a potential h2o2 producer. a high level of bacteriocin-like compound was synthesized by l. jensenii 5l08, with a bactericidal mode of action for g. vaginalis, c. albicans and escherichia coli. however, h2o2-dependent activity alone was not sufficient to inhibit the growth of c. albicans. simultaneous actions of h2o2 and bacteriocin-like compound produced by lactobacilli may be important for antagonizing pathogenic bacteria. these strains of lactobacilli may be excellent candidates for eventual use as probiotics to restore the normal microbial communities in the vaginal ecosystem.

TI  == prebiotic effects of oligosaccharides on selected vaginal lactobacilli and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select endogenous human vaginal lactobacilli strains on the basis of the main probiotic properties observed in the vaginal environment in order to use them for the evaluation of the potential prebiotic properties of oligosaccharides. from vaginal samples of 50 women with a normal flora, 17 lactobacilli strains were first isolated because of their high level of hydrogen peroxide production. then six strains were selected mainly for their ability (i) to adhere to vaginal cells, (ii) to produce compounds in sufficient amount, such as lactic acid, having an inhibitory action on pathogens, and less importantly, (iii) to demonstrate arginine deiminase activity. these six strains  were found to belong to three distinct species: lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii and l. vaginalis. one strain of each species was chosen as a potential vaginal probiotic strain with regard to our criteria. these three strains were then used to evaluate the prebiotic properties of different oligosaccharide series: two fructooligosaccharide series (fos actilight and fos raftilose) and two glucooligosaccharide series varying by their osidic linkages (alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos and alpha-1,2/alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos). the test was based on the ability of the oligosaccharides to promote the growth of the three beneficial strains selected but not of pathogenic microorganisms often encountered in urogenital infections such as candida albicans, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis. oligosaccharide hydrolysis was followed by hplc analysis. this revealed that two oligosaccharide series (fos actilight dp3 and all alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos dp > or = 4) were used only by the lactobacilli strains, the pathogenic microorganisms being unable to metabolise them. the selected lactobacilli and oligosaccharides are good candidates for incorporation  in a formula to prevent vaginal infections.

TI  == simultaneous display of multiple foreign peptides in the flid capping and flic filament proteins of the escherichia coli flagellum.
AB  == the bacterial flagellum is composed of more than 20 different proteins. the filament, which constitutes the major extracellular part of the flagellum, is built up of approximately 20,000 flic molecules that assemble at the growing distal end of the filament. a capping structure composed of five flid molecules located at the tip of the filament promotes polymerization of flic. lack of flid  leads to release of the subunits into the growth medium. we show here that flid can be successfully used in bacterial surface display. we tested various insertion sites in the capping protein, and the optimal region for display was at the variable region in flid. deletion and/or insertion at other sites resulted in decreased formation of flagella. we further developed the technique into a multihybrid display system in which three foreign peptides are simultaneously expressed within the same flagellum, i.e., d repeats of fnbpa from staphylococcus aureus at the tip and fragments of yada from yersinia enterocolitica as well as slpa from lactobacillus crispatus along the filament. this technology can have biotechnological applications, e.g., in simultaneous delivery of several effector molecules.

TI  == production of antimicrobial substances by lactic acid bacteria i: determination of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == restoration of the balance of different ecological niches has been proposed as a  way to control the income of pathogenic microorganisms. the genus lactobacillus has been used in different human and animal tracts as probiotic microorganisms with this objective in mind. the characteristics of the strains proposed as probiotics have been published or patented under the process of elaboration of different types of products. one of the mechanisms suggested to control the vaginal ecosystem is the production of antagonistic substances (lactic acid, bacteriocins, or h2o2). the h2o2-producing microorganisms present in the vagina of healthy women have been suggested as some of the bacteria responsible for maintenance of ecological balance, mainly in pregnant women. the absence of these microorganisms is related to a higher risk of: bacterial vaginosis, recurrent urinary tract infections by escherichia coli, and acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). bauer has proposed that h2o2-producing lactobacilli also might exert control over vaginal cancer through specific interactions of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide anion, hydroxyl radicals, and hypochlorous acid. the conversion of h2o2 into more toxic compounds during the oxidative process is potentiated by peroxidase and halures. this enzyme and some halures, such as chloride and bromide, are present in vaginal washes in sufficient amounts to allow an optimal environment for successful inhibition of pathogens. in vitro tests provide an approach for determining the ability of lactobacilli to produce h2o2. the h2o2 amounts produced in such systems are probably not a direct reflection of what happens in the vaginal tract of women or animals, which is not yet know. however, there is a registered patent with an h2o2-generating l. crispatus strain, also supporting the use of h2o2-producing lactobacilli to restore the vaginal ecosystem.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected on the basis of characteristics indicating that they would be good candidates for a competitive exclusion product (cep) that would inhibit escherichia coli o157:h7 in the intestinal tract of live cattle. fecal samples from cattle that were culture negative for e. coli o157:h7  were collected. lab were isolated from cattle feces by repeated plating on deman  rogosa sharpe agar and lactobacillus selection agar. six hundred eighty-six pure  colonies were isolated, and an agar spot test was used to test each isolate for its inhibition of a four-strain mixture of e. coli o157:h7. three hundred fifty-five isolates (52%) showed significant inhibition. seventy-five isolates showing maximum inhibition were screened for acid and bile tolerance. most isolates were tolerant of acid at ph levels of 2, 4, 5, and 7 and at bile levels  of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3% (oxgall) and were subsequently identified with the api system. lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus delbreukii, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, leuconostoc spp., and pediococcus acidilactici were the most commonly identified lab. nineteen strains were further tested for antibiotic resistance and inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 in manure and rumen fluid. four of these 19 strains showed susceptibility to all of the antibiotics, 13 significantly reduced e. coli counts in manure, and 15 significantly reduced e. coli counts in rumen fluid (p < 0.05) during at least one of the sampling periods. one of the strains, m35, was selected as the best candidate for a cep. a 16s rrna sequence analysis of m35 revealed its close homology to lactobacillus crispatus. the cep developed will be used in cattle-feeding trials.

AB  == the role of fimbria in adherence of an avian pathogenic escherichia coli (apec) o78 strain 789 to chicken intestine was studied. bacterial adhesion to tissue sections representing the regions within the chicken intestinal tract was determined by using immunohistochemical methods. e. coli 789 grown to express the type 1 fimbria adhered efficiently to the crop epithelium, to the lamina propria  of intestinal villi, and to the apical surfaces of both the mature as well as the crypt-located enterocytes in intestinal villi, whereas no adhesion to mucus-producing goblet cells was detected. the adhesion was inhibited by mannoside and the role of type 1 fimbriae in the observed adhesion was confirmed  with a recombinant strain expressing type 1 fimbriae genes cloned from e. coli and salmonella enterica. e. coli 789 strain grown to favor ac/i fimbriae expression as well as the recombinant e. coli strain expressing the fac genes adhered to goblet cells but only poorly to the other epithelial sites. e. coli strain 789 as well as s. enterica serovar typhimurium ir715 and s. enterica serovar enteriditis tn2 strains were able to multiply in ileal mucus medium. the  type 1 fimbria expressing bacteria adhered to the ileal mucus, whereas the ac/i fimbriated strains showed poor adherence to the mucus. the adhesion of e. coli 789 onto the crop epithelium and the follicle associated epithelium of the chicken ileum was efficiently inhibited by an adhesive strain st1 of lactobacillus crispatus isolated from chicken, whereas poor inhibition of e. coli adherence was observed with the weakly adhesive l. crispatus strain 134mi. the type 1 fimbriae may be important in colonization of the chicken intestine by apec and salmonella.

TI  == domains in the s-layer protein cbsa of lactobacillus crispatus involved in adherence to collagens, laminin and lipoteichoic acids and in self-assembly.
AB  == the protein regions in the s-layer protein cbsa of lactobacillus crispatus jcm 5810, needed for binding to collagens and laminin, anchoring to bacterial cell wall, as well as self-assembly, were mapped by deletion analysis of his-tagged peptides isolated from escherichia coli and by heterologous expression on lactobacillus casei. mature cbsa is 410 amino acids long, and stepwise genetic truncation at both termini revealed that the region 32-271 carries the infor-mation for self-assembly of cbsa into a periodic structure. the lactobacillar s-layer proteins exhibit sequence variation in their assembly domain, but the border regions 30-34 and 269-274 in cbsa are conserved in valine-rich short sequences. short deletions or substitutions at these regions affected the morphology of his-cbsa polymers, which varied from sheet-like to cylindrical tubular polymers, and further truncation beyond the dna encoding residues 32 and 271 leads to a non-periodic aggregation. the self-assembly of the truncated peptides, as seen by electron microscopy, was correlated with their behaviour in a cross-linking study. the shorter peptides not forming a regular polymer were observed by the cross-linking study and mass spectrometry to form dimers, trimers and tetramers, whereas the other peptides were cross-linked to large multimers only. binding of solubilized type i and iv collagens was observed with the his-cbsa peptides 1-274 and 31-287, but not with the smaller peptides regardless of their ability to form regular polymers. strain jcm 5810 also adheres to immobilized laminin and, in order to analyse the possible laminin binding by cbsa, cbsa and its fragments were expressed on the surface of l. casei. expression of the cbsa peptides 1-274, 1-287, 28-287 and 31-287 on l. casei conferred adhesiveness to both laminin and collagen immobilized on glass as well as to laminin- and collagen-containing regions in chicken colon and ileum. the c-terminal peptides 251-410 and 288-410 bound to l. crispatus jcm 5810 cells  from which the s-layer had been depleted by chemical extraction, whereas no binding was seen with the his-cbsa peptides 1-250 or 1-269 or to cells with an intact s-layer. the his-cbsa peptides 251-410 and 288-410 bound to teichoic acids of several bacterial species. the results show that cbsa is an adhesive complex with an n-terminal assembly domain exhibiting affinity for pericellular tissue components and a cationic c-terminal domain binding to negatively charged cell wall components.

TI  == increased mucosal tumour necrosis factor alpha production in crohn's disease can  be downregulated ex vivo by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == background and aims: tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation in crohn's disease. the effect of bacteria on tnf-alpha release by intestinal mucosa was investigated. methods: ileal specimens were obtained at surgery from 10 patients with crohn's disease (ileal stricture) and five disease controls undergoing right hemicolectomy (caecal cancer). mucosal explants from each specimen were cultured for 24 hours with either non-pathogenic escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei dn-114001, l bulgaricus lb10, or l crispatus (each study contained blank wells with no bacteria). tissue and bacterial viability was confirmed by lactate dehydrogenase  (ldh) release and culture. concentrations of tnf-alpha were measured in supernatants and the phenotype of the intestinal lymphocytes was analysed by flow cytometry. results: coculture of mucosa with bacteria did not modify ldh release. release of tnf-alpha by inflamed crohn's disease mucosa was significantly reduced by coculture with l casei or l bulgaricus; changes induced by l crispatus or e coli were not significant. the effect of l casei and l bulgaricus was not prevented by protease inhibitors. coculture with l casei and l bulgaricus reduced the number of cd4 cells as well as tnf-alpha expression among intraepithelial lymphocytes from crohn's disease mucosa. none of the bacteria induced changes in  non-inflamed mucosa. conclusions: probiotics interact with immunocompetent cells  using the mucosal interface and modulate locally the production of proinflammatory cytokines.

AB  == objective: we examined the antimicrobial activity and composition of vaginal fluid. study design: vaginal fluid from preweighed tampons was assayed for ph, lactic acid, and antimicrobial polypeptides. the fluid was also fractionated by molecular filtration. antimicrobial activity of whole fluid was determined against representative resident and exogenous microbes, and its fractions were tested against escherichia coli. results: vaginal fluids (5/5 donors) were permissive for lactobacillus crispatus and vaginalis and candida albicans, but not for escherichia coli, streptococcus group b, and lactobacillus jensenii in three of five donors. the antimicrobial activity against e coli was predominantly in a <3-kd fraction and correlated with both low ph and high lactic acid content. compared with a matched ph buffer, lactic acid markedly suppressed the growth of  e coli. concentrated 2- or 5-fold, the protein-rich fraction was active against e coli. conclusion: vaginal fluid exerts selective antimicrobial activity against nonresident bacterial species. the activity is mediated by lactic acid, low ph, and antimicrobial polypeptides.

AB  == aims: this study aimed to evaluate the efficiency with which lactobacillus crispatus jcm 5810 inhibited the adhesion of enteric pathogens to a synthetic basement membrane and to elucidate the mechanism underlying the inhibition. methods and results: lactobacillus crispatus jcm 5810 inhibited the adhesion of three diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli strains to a reconstituted basement membrane preparation called matrigel, used as a model of a damaged intestinal tissue site. inhibition was also observed with the use of immobilized laminin, a  major component of matrigel, but diminished after the removal of s-layer protein  (cbsa) from jcm 5810 cells. the isolated cbsa inhibited the adhesion of e. coli to both matrigel and immobilized laminin. lactobacillus crispatus jcm 5810 and cbsa seem to inhibit pathogenic e. coli from adhering to basement membrane via competition with laminin molecules for binding sites. conclusions: these results  suggested that not only lact. crispatus jcm 5810 cells but cbsa alone might prevent pathogens from colonizing damaged intestinal tissues. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study to show the applied aspect of lactobacillus s-layer protein.

TI  == the s-layer protein of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356: identification and characterisation of domains responsible for s-protein assembly and cell wall binding.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, like many other bacteria, harbors a surface layer consisting of a protein (s(a)-protein) of 43 kda. s(a)-protein could be readily extracted and crystallized in vitro into large crystalline patches on lipid monolayers with a net negative charge but not on lipids with a net neutral charge. reconstruction of the s-layer from crystals grown on dioleoylphosphatidylserine indicated an oblique lattice with unit cell dimensions (a=118 a; b=53 a, and gamma=102 degrees ) resembling those determined for the s-layer of lactobacillus helveticus atcc 12046. sequence comparison of s(a)-protein with s-proteins from l. helveticus, lactobacillus crispatus and the  s-proteins encoded by the silent s-protein genes from l. acidophilus and l. crispatus suggested the presence of two domains, one comprising the n-terminal two-thirds (san), and another made up of the c-terminal one-third (sac) of s(a)-protein. the sequence of the n-terminal domains is variable, while that of the c-terminal domain is highly conserved in the s-proteins of these organisms and contains a tandem repeat. proteolytic digestion of s(a)-protein showed that san was protease-resistant, suggesting a compact structure. sac was rapidly degraded by proteases and therefore probably has a more accessible structure. dna sequences encoding san or green fluorescent protein fused to sac (gfp-sac) were efficiently expressed in escherichia coli. purified san could crystallize into mono and multi-layered crystals with the same lattice parameters as those found for authentic s(a)-protein. a calculated s(a)-protein minus san density-difference map revealed the probable location, in projection, of the sac  domain, which is missing from the truncated san peptide. the gfp-sac fusion product was shown to bind to the surface of l. acidophilus, l. helveticus and l.  crispatus cells from which the s-layer had been removed, but not to non-stripped  cells or to lactobacillus casei.

TI  == characterization of the collagen-binding s-layer protein cbsa of lactobacillus crispatus.
AB  == the cbsa gene of lactobacillus crispatus strain jcm 5810, encoding a protein that mediates adhesiveness to collagens, was characterized and expressed in escherichia coli. the cbsa open reading frame encoded a signal sequence of 30 amino acids and a mature polypeptide of 410 amino acids with typical features of  a bacterial s-layer protein. the cbsa gene product was expressed as a his tag fusion protein, purified by affinity chromatography, and shown to bind solubilized as well as immobilized type i and iv collagens. three other lactobacillus s-layer proteins, slpa, cbsb, and slpnb, bound collagens only weakly, and sequence comparisons of cbsa with these s-layer proteins were used to select sites in cbsa where deletions and mutations were introduced. in addition,  hybrid s-layer proteins that contained the n or the c terminus from cbsa, slpa, or slpnb as well as n- and c-terminally truncated peptides from cbsa were constructed by gene fusion. analysis of these molecules revealed the major collagen-binding region within the n-terminal 287 residues and a weaker type i collagen-binding region in the c terminus of the cbsa molecule. the mutated or hybrid cbsa molecules and peptides that failed to polymerize into a periodic s-layer did not bind collagens, suggesting that the crystal structure with a regular array is optimal for expression of collagen binding by cbsa. strain jcm 5810 was found to contain another s-layer gene termed cbsb that was 44% identical in sequence to cbsa. rna analysis showed that cbsa, but not cbsb, was transcribed under laboratory conditions. s-layer-protein-expressing cells of strain jcm 5810  adhered to collagen-containing regions in the chicken colon, suggesting that cbsa-mediated collagen binding represents a true tissue adherence property of l.  crispatus.
