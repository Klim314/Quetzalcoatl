food preservative potential of gassericin a-containing concentrate prepared from  a cheese whey culture supernatant from lactobacillus gasseri la39.
gassericin a (ga) is a circular bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39. in this study, ga-containing concentrate was prepared using a cross-flow membrane filtration device (30 kda cut-off) from the culture supernatant of lb. gasseri la39 cultivated in a cheese whey-based food-grade medium. the bacteriocin activity titer in the concentrate was 16 times as high as that of the culture supernatant and was completely maintained through each incubation at 4 degrees c for 3 months, 37 degrees c for 2 months, 60 degrees c for 5 h, and 100 degrees c for 30 min. the ga-containing concentrate was used with glycine powder to make custard creams, and then four representative strains of custard cream spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, achromobacter denitrificans and pseudomonas fluorescens) were individually inoculated at c. 10(3) colony forming units/g in the custard creams. throughout 30 days of incubation at 30 degrees c, all of the inoculated bacteria were completely inhibited by the combination of 5% (w/w) of the ga-containing concentrate and 0.5% (w/w) glycine. this is the first highly practical application of ga to foods as a biopreservative, and the concentration method and the bacteriocin concentrate would contribute to biopreservation of several foods.
isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus), gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
effects of gassericins a and t, bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus gasseri, with glycine on custard cream preservation.
lactobacillus gasseri la39 and la158 isolated from human-infant feces produce bacteriocins named gassericins a and t, respectively. both gassericins have high heat stability (121 degrees c, 10 min), good ph tolerance (ph 2-11), and strong bactericidality against many gram-positive bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria, and thus are expected to be effective food preservatives. a microwell plate assay against 12 strains of custard cream spoilage bacteria showed that the gassericins had broader antibacterial spectra than nisin a. although the gassericins allowed gram-negative isolates to grow, they successfully inhibited the growth of all tested bacterial strains in microwells with the addition of glycine. glycine was bacteriostatic against many strains except lactic acid bacteria. for practical use, gassericin a was efficiently produced by cultivation in a food-grade medium improved using cheese whey, nourishing proteose peptone, and surfactant yolk lecithin. the practical preservative effect of gassericin a and glycine was verified from the viability of 4 isolated strains, bacillus cereus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, achromobacter denitrificans, and pseudomonas fluorescens, in custard creams. custard cream containing 123 arbitrary units of gassericin a per milliliter entirely growth-inhibited the 2 gram-positive strains. in custard cream containing an insufficient amount of gassericin a (49 arbitrary units/ml), the gram-positive strains gradually grew but were completely inhibited by the addition of 0.5% (wt/wt) glycine. the 2 gram-negative strains did not multiply even in the additive-free custard cream, probably because of the unsuitable growth environment. this is the first report showing the combined effect of bacteriocin and glycine and their application for food preservation, which may be helpful for future use in the food industry.
dna sequencing and homologous expression of a small peptide conferring immunity to gassericin a, a circular bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39.
gassericin a, produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39, is a hydrophobic circular bacteriocin. the dna region surrounding the gassericin a structural gene, gaaa, was sequenced, and seven open reading frames (orfs) of 3.5 kbp (gaabcadite) were found with possible functions in gassericin a production, secretion, and immunity. the deduced products of the five consecutive orfs gaaadite have homology to those of genes involved in butyrivibriocin ar10 production, although the genetic arrangements are different in the two circular bacteriocin genes. gaai is a small, positively charged hydrophobic peptide of 53 amino acids containing a putative transmembrane segment. heterologous expression and homologous expression of gaai in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363 and l. gasseri jcm1131(t), respectively, were studied. gaai-expressing strains exhibited at least sevenfold-higher resistance to gassericin a than corresponding control strains, indicating that gaai encodes an immunity peptide for gassericin a. comparison of gaai to peptides with similar characteristics found in the circular bacteriocin gene loci is discussed.
mutational and biochemical analyses of the endolysin lys(gay) encoded by the lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131t phage phi gay.
the lys(gay) of lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131(t) phage phigay endolysin was purified to homogeneity using the escherichia coli/his.tag system. zymographic and spectrophotometric assays showed that lys(gay) lysed over 20 heated gram-positive bacterial species as the substrates, including lactobacilli, lactococci, enterococci, micrococci, and staphylococci. the enzymatic activity had the ph and temperature optima of about 6.5 and 37 degrees c, respectively. amino-acid substitution analysis revealed that 13 residues of lys(gay) were involved in cell-lytic activity: in the beta/alpha(gay) domain, g10, d12, e33, d36, h60, y61, d96, e98, v124, l132, and d198; in the sh3b(gay) domain, y272 and w284. in addition, deletion analysis demonstrated that the beta/alpha(gay) domain of n-terminal 216 residues is the core enzyme portion, although the cell-lytic ability is lower than that of lys(gay). these mutational experiments suggested that beta/alpha(gay) (in which two acidic residues of d12 and e98 likely act as catalytic residues) is responsible for cell-lytic activity, and sh3b(gay) promotes beta/alpha(gay) possibly through cell-wall binding function. the purified his-tagged sh3b(gay) domain containing 94 residues from s217 to k310 (i) bound to gram-positive bacteria susceptible to lys(gay), (ii) induced aggregation of exponentially growing cells of l. gasseri jcm 1131(t), l. casei iam 1045, lactococcus lactis c2, l. lactis mg 1363, and enterococcus hirae iam 1262 by forming thread-like chained cells, (iii) inhibited lytic activity of lys(gay), and (iv) impeded autolysis of l. gasseri jcm 1131(t) in buffer systems. a truncated protein hdeltash3b(gay) lacking in n-terminal 21 residues (from s217 to e237) of sh3b(gay) and an amino-acid substituted protein hsh3b(gay)g (w284g) lost the activities of hsh3b(gay), showing that the n-terminal region and w284 probably play important roles in the sh3b(gay) function(s).
